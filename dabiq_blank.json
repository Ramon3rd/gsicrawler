Where are your missiles? Where are your weapons of mass destruction? Why is it that the world has united against you? Why  have  the  nations  of  disbelief  entrenched together against you?”\n“So know that – by Allah – we fear not the swarms of planes, nor ballistic missiles, nor drones, nor satellites, nor battleships, nor weapons of mass destruction.  How  could  we  fear  them,  while Allah the Exalted has said, {If Allah should aid you, no one can overcome you; but if He should forsake you, who is there that can aid you after Him? And upon Allah let the believers rely} [Āli ‘Imrān: 160]. How could we fear them, while Allah the Exalted has said, {So do not weaken and do not grieve, and you will be superior if you are [true] believers} [Āli ‘Imrān: 139].”\nother, for some people have entered your ranks who are not of you and are only claimants. And thus some disorder has occurred. So it has become  necessary  for  a  trial  to  come,  expel  the filth, and purify the ranks. We ask Allah for forgiveness and wellness.  Also, pride and  conceit has entered some of our souls, and thus some of us transgressed and oppressed others. So it is necessary for the sins to be expelled, so that you may return to your Lord. Allah has loved the mujāhidīn, and so there is no choice but for Him to take some martyrs. We ask Allah to make us of them, not from the disgraced nor those afflicted [in their religion].”\n“O America, O allies of America, and O crusaders,  know  that  the  matter  is  more  dangerous than  you  have  imagined  and  greater  than  you have envisioned. We have warned you that today we are in a new era, an era where the State, its soldiers, and its sons are leaders not slaves. They are a people who through the ages have not known defeat. The outcome of their battles is concluded before they begin. They have not prepared for a battle since the time of Noah except with absolute conviction of victory. Being killed – according to their account – is a victory. This is where the secret lies. You fight a people who can never be defeated.”\n“Therefore Allah will give you victory. Indeed, Allah will give you victory. By Allah, Allah will give you victory.  So  guarantee  for  us  two  matters,  and we will guarantee you – by Allah’s permission –  constant  victory  and  consolidation.  First,  do not  oppress  anyone  nor  be  content  with  oppression by being silent about it and not raising the matter to those in authority. Second, do not become conceited or arrogant. This is what we fear from you and fear for you.”\n“Thereafter know that a trial, sifting, and selection, are necessary between one period and an-\n“And so we promise you by Allah’s permission that this campaign will be your final campaign.

He made the provision of His Messenger from the latter [the fay’].\nWar booty is more lawful than other income for a number of reasons.\nIt is seized from one who does not deserve it, because he uses it to aid himself in disobeying Allah  and  associating  others  with  Him.  So  if  it is  taken  from  one  who  uses  it  contrary  to  the obedience of Allah, the practice of tawhīd and the  da’wah  to  worship  Him,  then  such  wealth becomes  the  most  beloved  of  wealth  to  Allah ta’ālā and the purest form of income in His sight.Also, he (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would not perform jihād except so that Allah’s word would be the highest and His religion the most manifest. He did not perform jihād for the sake of ghanīmah. So provision would come to him pursuant to his worship and jihād fī sabīlillāh. Therefore, he did not dedicate any of his time solely towards seeking provision.  Rather he would worship Allah in all his time, and practice tawhīd of Allah and be sincere to Him. So Allah made his provision easy during such worship, without him intending to seek it or endeavoring to pursue it.It was reported in the mursal narration (i.e. reported  with  no  mention  of  the  Sahābī  in  the \nisnād), that he (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “I am the messenger of mercy. I am the messenger of the malhamah (bloody battle). Allah sent me with jihād and He did not send me with agriculture” [reported by Ibn Sa’d in “at-Tabaqāt”].\nAl-Baghawī  reported  in  his  “Mu’jam”  a  marfū’ hadīth (i.e. a hadīth whose words are conveyed as  the  Prophet’s)  [that  the  Prophet  (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said], “Indeed Allah has sent me with guidance and the religion of truth. He did not make me a farmer, nor a merchant, nor a shouter in the markets. And He placed my provision in my spear.”\nHe mentioned the spear rather than the sword so that it is not understood that he got provision from the ghanīmah wealth. Rather, his provision was  from  the  fay’  that  Allah  granted  him  from Khaybar and Fadak.\nFay’ is what the enemy leaves behind after fearfully fleeing, contrary to ghanīmah, which is taken  through  fighting  with  the  sword.  Therefore, mention of the spear more clearly indicates the acquirement  of  fay’,  because  the  spear  is  seen by the enemy from a distance, so he flees, and thus  he  flees  from  the  spear’s  shade  by  which fay’ is taken. The provision of the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was from fay’, not ghanīmah, which is taken by fighting with a sword. And Allah knows best.\ndabiq\f"

        "@value": "path of Allah? So Allah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, ‘Whoever fights so that the word of Allah is the highest is fighting in the path of Allah.’”\n[2] Ask the people of knowledge what is required of you when anything befalls you concerning the obligation of jihād in the path of Allah, for there is  a  scholarly  consensus  that  knowledge  must precede  action.  Allah’s  Messenger  (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa salllam) said, “Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.”  So don’t kill or  take  ghanīmah  without  first  knowing  why you’re doing so. And the least that can be done in that regard is to seek the fatwā of a scholar whose  knowledge  and  religious  practice  you trust.\n[3]  Beware  of  letting  the  affection  you  have towards a relative or loved one turn you away from  aiding  Allah’s  religion.  Indeed,  we  know that this can tear you apart, but remember the statement of Allah (ta’ālā), {O you who have believed, do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies, extending to them affection while they  have  disbelieved  in  what  came  to  you  of the truth} [Al-Mumtahanah: 1]. For Allah’s right is more obligatory, and supporting His religion is more essential.\n[4] By Allah, I love you, and I love that which will save you. So listen to my advice concerning an important issue, the issue of takfīr. The Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “Whoever says concerning a believer that which is not true, Allah will cause him to reside in the mud of  corruption  [composed  of  the  pus  from  the people of Hellfire] until he takes back what he said.”  Therefore, know my dear brother that the label and ruling of kufr is a right that belongs to Allah (ta’ālā) and which you are not allowed to apply to anyone except those who deserve it according to the Sharī’ah. And know that takfīr has both conditions and preventative factors, so we don’t declare takfīr of someone unless the conditions are fulfilled and the preventative factors are  eliminated.  A  person  might  make  a  state-\nADVICE FOR THE SOLDIERS OF THE ISLAMIC STATE\nment  or  action  of  kufr  and  yet  would  not  be guilty of kufr due to the presence of one of the preventative factors. Therefore, one whose Islam is established with certainty is not expelled from  Islam  except  with  certainty.  So  beware of  suspicion,  and  ensure  that  you’re  well-informed regarding the issues that the practicing scholars have differed over.\n[5] Fulfill any agreements and covenants of security that are valid according to the Sharī’ah, and be extremely cautious of Shaytān’s incitements. Allah (ta’ālā) said, {So he who breaks his word  only  breaks  it  to  the  detriment  of  himself} [Al-Fath: 10]. Allah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  said,  “The  blood  of  every Muslim is equal. The lowest amongst them will have  his  guarantee  of  protection  fulfilled  by them. The most distant of them will also have his guarantee of protection honored. They are one hand against all others. The weak fighter amongst them is equal in his share of ghanīmah with the strong fighter amongst them, and the dispatched fighter who guards the rear of the army is equal in his share of ghanīmah with the fighter who is sent out on an expedition to attack.”\nLikewise, know that we do not allow any soldier to make pacts or grant security. This is only to be done by Amīrul-Mu’minīn and his deputies, for he is typically more aware of, and better capable of determining the interests of the State.\n[6] Strive hard to obey Allah and beware the ominous consequences of sin as well as the evil of your inner self and the Shaytān. For indeed alFārūq, ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattāb, advised Sa’d Ibn Abī Waqqās (radiyallāhu ‘anhumā) saying, “So I order both you and the soldiers who are with you to have taqwā of Allah, and I order both you and the soldiers who are with you to be more vigilant against committing sins than you are against your enemy, for the sins of your soldiers should be more feared than their enemy. And ask Allah to help you against your inner selves just as you ask Him for victory over your enemy.”\ndabiq\n\fTHE QA’IDAH OF ADH-DHAWAHIRI, AL-HARARI, AND AN-NADHARI, AND THE ABSENT YEMENI WISDOM\nFEATURE  \nthing beyond that knowledge such as pitting the statements of the people against each other and excessively searching for their faults and slip-ups […] as well as excessively searching for the unnecessary aspects of sciences that do not benefit one’s religious adherence, that serve to distract one from Allah and from being preoccupied with Him, that harden one’s heart towards His dhikr, and that cause the experts of such sciences to desire a high position and leadership of the people.  None  of  this  is  praiseworthy,  and  indeed the  Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  used to  seek  refuge  from  knowledge  that  does  not benefit [Reported by Muslim on the authority of Zayd]. In a hadīth reported from him he said, ‘Ask Allah for beneficial knowledge and seek refuge with Allah from knowledge that does not benefit’ [Reported by Ibn Mājah on the authority of Jābir]. In another hadīth reported from him he said, ‘Indeed, from knowledge is to be ignorant of some things’ [Reported by Abū Dāwūd on the authority of Buraydah]. The Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) disliked excessive and extensive speech, and loved concise speech. There are many ahādīth reported from him to that effect and they would take long to mention” [Majmū’ Rasā’il Ibn Rajab].\nHe  (rahimahullāh)  also  said,  “Ibn  Mas’ūd  also said, ‘You live in a time in which there are many scholars and few speakers, and there will come a time after you in which there will be few scholars and many speakers.’ Therefore, he who has extensive knowledge and speaks little is praiseworthy, and he who is the opposite is blameworthy.  The  Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam) attested  to  the  people  of  Yemen  having  īmān and fiqh. The people of Yemen are the least in speech from amongst the people and the least excessive in knowledge because their knowledge is beneficial knowledge in their hearts, and they only express with their tongues what they need to of that knowledge. And that is true fiqh and beneficial knowledge” [Fadl ‘Ilm as-Salaf].\nAfter  reading  “Fadl  ‘Ilm  as-Salaf  ‘Alā  ‘Ilm  alKhalaf”  by  al-Hāfidh  Ibn  Rajab  (rahimahullāh), \nhis  statement  “The  people  of  Yemen  are  the least in speech from amongst the people” stuck to my mind for years. I then witnessed it in reality firsthand in the bay’āt announced by the mujāhidīn of the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen, Sinai, Libya, and Algeria, for the shortest of the five statements was the statement of the mujāhidīn of Yemen. It contained wisdom, fiqh and īmān, and through it, they expressed their full conviction in a brief and concise manner. I ask Allah to make them firm upon their covenant so that they meet Allah while He is pleased with them.\nThe mujāhidīn of Yemen said, “Allah’s Messenger  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  had  given  us glad tidings of Khilāfah upon the methodology of prophethood. And indeed, by Allah, we have seen it as a Khilāfah upon the methodology of prophethood.  And  when  we  heard  the  trumpets  of  the  Jews  and  Christians  –  the  callers upon the gates of Hellfire – we answered the order of Allah’s Messenger that obliged sticking to the jamā’ah of the Muslims and their Imām, for Hudhayfah (radiyallāhu ‘anh) said, ‘The people used to ask Allah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) about good, and I used to ask him about evil, fearing that it might overtake me…’ In  the  hadīth,  he  says,  ‘Is  there  any  evil  after this good?’ He responded, ‘Yes, callers upon the gates of Hellfire. Whoever answers them will be thrown into it by them.’ He said, ‘O Allah’s Messenger, describe them to me.’ He said, ‘They are from our skin and speak with our tongues.’ He said, ‘So what do you order me with if I reach that time?’ He said, ‘Stick to the jamā’ah of the Muslims and their Imām’ [Al-Bukhārī and Muslim].”\nThus,  they  recognized  the  disease  –  splitting and differing – and they knew the cure – unity and rallying together. They understood that rallying together meant sticking to the jamā’ah of the Muslims (the Khilāfah) and their Imām (the Khalīfah), not rallying together upon factionalism and partisanship. So they spoke with the prophetic wisdom, and said “we hear and obey” without any reluctance, complication, or arrogance.\ndabiq\n1\f"

The terrorist attacks carried out in the final months of 2015 demonstrate that it is capable of committing attacks on…targets outside the territories under its control. The extent of its reach was notably demonstrated by the suicide bombings in Beirut on 12 November 2015, the coordinated attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015 and the attacks in Jakarta by an ISIL affiliate on 14 January 2016, which closely resembled the Paris attacks…”\n“The recent expansion of the ISIL sphere of influence across West and North Africa, the Middle East and South and South-East Asia demonstrates  the  speed  and  scale  at  which the gravity of the threat has evolved in just 18 months. The complexity of the recent attacks and  the  level  of  planning,  coordination  and sophistication  involved  raise  concerns  about its  future  evolution.  Moreover,  other  terrorist  groups…are  sufficiently  attracted  by  its underlying  ideology  to  pledge  allegiance  to its so-called caliphate and self-proclaimed caliph. ISIL has also benefited from the arrival of a steady stream of foreign terrorist fighters, who continue to leave their communities to replenish its ranks. The return of these fighters from the battlefields of Iraq and the Syrian Arab  Republic  and  other  conflict  zones  is  a further  major  concern,  as  returnees  can  extend the presence of ISIL to their States of origin and use their skills and combat experience \nto recruit additional sympathizers, establish terrorist networks and commit terrorist acts…”\nThe report then goes on to detail how the Khilāfah implements the Sharī’ah of zakāh, da’wah, jihād, jizyah, hisbah, slavery, and hudūd – referring to all these laws with terms of mockery – and how this Sharī’ah poses a threat to “international peace and security,” AKA the “new world order.” Instead of yielding by realizing that the Khilāfah is here to stay and will continue ruling by the Sharī’ah and terrorizing its enemies, he recommended the following to the tawāghīt of the divided “United Nations”:\n“The resolution of ongoing conflicts, including the Syrian conflict, would have a direct impact on the driving forces behind the recruitment of foreign terrorist fighters by ISIL … In order to address the grave threat posed by ISIL, including the influx of foreign terrorist fighters to Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic and ISIL’s extensive financing activities, it is essential to identify a political resolution to the Syrian conflict. This process will require sustained and determined international commitment and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), which sets out a path towards formal intra-Syrian negotiations on a political transition process pursuant to the 2012 Geneva communiqué and a parallel nationwide ceasefire.”\nAnd  thus,  after  the  Riyadh  Conference  of  the  Saudi  tāghūt concluded, the Nusayriyyah and their atheist allies in the Democratic Forces of Syria – with Russian support and American consent  –  blitzkrieged  across  regions  held  by  the  murtadd  sahwāt, taking many major cities and towns through mere “negotiations” with sahwah leaders who were part of the conspiracy to achieve “a political resolution to the Syrian conflict.”\nIs it not time the naive soldiers of the sahwah realize the evil of the plot in which they have served, repent from their apostasy, and join the ranks of the Khilāfah?\n\funder one imām and to listen to and obey him. Secondly, we have seen that the Khilāfah declared by the leadership of the Islamic State has  fulfilled  all  the  conditions enumerated by the scholars from among the righteous Salaf of the Ummah.  The  Prophet  g  said, “Whoever  dies  without  having  a pledge of allegiance, dies a death of jāhiliyyah” [Reported by Muslim from Ibn ‘Umar]. Thirdly, we saw  the  crusaders,  the  Rāfidah, the PKK atheists, and all the other kāfir parties uniting against the Khilāfah and striking it altogether from a single bow. And thus, we realized  that  it  is  an  obligation upon us and the rest of the believers to join the camp of īmān and fight  against  the  kuffār,  striking them altogether from a single bow as well. Allah c said, {And those who  disbelieved  are  allies  of  one another. If you do not do so, there will be fitnah on earth and great corruption}  [Al-Anfāl:  73].\nDĀBIQ:  How  was  the  reaction among the Muslims of Bengal towards  the  operations  conducted by  the  Khilāfah  soldiery  there?\nSH.  ABŪ  IBRĀHĪM:  The  muwahiddīn  in  Bengal  were  greatly  supportive  of  our  operations against  the  kuffār,  walhamdulillāh. They saw us fighting against all  the  kuffār  in  our  targeting  of the  crusaders,  the  Rāfidah,  the Qādiyāniyyah,  the  Hindus,  the missionaries, and others, all within  a  short  period  of  time.  They saw that with the help of Allah, a small number of mujāhidīn with limited  means  are  able  to  target and  intimidate  the  various  sects of kufr in any part of the region despite all the false claims of supremacy attributed to the tāghūt \nforces and designed  to  intimidate the believers. This brought  hope to  the  Muslims in Bengal after a lengthy pause in jihād in  the  region. Thus,  by  the grace of Allah, the  revival  of the in Bengal  through  our  operations brought  happiness  to  the  Muslims  in  Bengal  and  everywhere else while also enraging the kuffār. And  all  praise  is  due  to  Allah alone.\nA Qādiyānī temple\njihād \nDĀBIQ:  Has  the  emergence  of the  Khilāfah’s  soldiers  in  Bengal had any effect in intimidating or silencing the apostates who insult the Prophet g and those who call to  secularism?\nSH. ABŪ IBRĀHĪM: Alhamdulillāh,  the  emergence  of  the  soldiers of the Khilāfah has terrified the kuffār in the region in general and in particular the atheists and secularists  who  mock  Islam  and our  beloved  Prophet  g.  This became  evident  when  some  of the leading atheists in the region claimed  to  have  received  death threats  from  the  soldiers  of  the Khilāfah in Bengal. But it is not the methodology of the Khilāfah’s soldiers  to  send  mere  threats  to the enemies of Allah. Rather, we let our actions do the talking. And our  soldiers  are  presently  sharpening  their  knives  to  slaughter the  atheists,  the  mockers  of  the Prophet g, and every other apostate in the region, bi idnillāh. We say  just  as  Shaykh  Usāmah  Ibn \nLādin  said, “If there is no limit to the freedom of your words, then let your hearts be open to the freedom  of  our  actions.”\nDĀBIQ: Tell us about the general state of Islam and religiousness in Bengal.\nSH. ABŪ IBRĀHĪM: In general, the people of Bengal love Islam and  try  to  practice  its  rites  with great enthusiasm. However, there is much ignorance of the Qur’ān and  the  Sunnah  here,  leading  to the growing influence of heretical sects and murtadd parties. Wa lā hawla wa lā quwwata illā billāh.\nDĀBIQ: What deviant and apostate sects exist in Bengal?\nSH.  ABŪ  IBRĀHĪM:  Sadly, there are many deviant and apostate sects in Bengal. First, there is a small number of Rāfidah in Bengal who are funded and supported by  the  Iranian  government.  Secondly, there is a significant number  of  Qādiyāniyyah  in  Bengal. Thirdly,  there  is  a  large  number of  apostates  who  have  converted from Islam to Christianity due to the  deceptive  preaching  carried out by local and foreign missionaries  and  the  relentless  efforts  of \n\f"

You think they are  together,  but  their  hearts  are  diverse.  That  is  because they are a people who do not reason} [Al-Hashr: 14].\nSo the kuffār – whether they are Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox  Christians,  whether  they  are  Orthodox,  Conservative, or Progressive Jews, whether they are Buddhists, Hindus, or Sikhs, whether they are capitalists, communists, or fascists – they are ultimately allies of one another against Islam and the Muslims. This is because Islam – the religion of truth and fitrah – is the greatest threat to their religions of falsehood, all of which are at war with the inborn nature of man. This is also because the tawāghīt and dajājilah (plural of dajjāl) of these false religions fear losing control of their flocks of blind sheep and the wealth contained in their wooly pockets. This is also because the flocks of blind sheep fear losing their animalistic societies and carnal cultures that serve their lusts, desires, and doubts at the expense of reviving and nurturing the fitrah within their dead hearts.

He made the provision of His Messenger from the latter [the fay’].\nWar booty is more lawful than other income for a number of reasons.\nIt is seized from one who does not deserve it, because he uses it to aid himself in disobeying Allah  and  associating  others  with  Him.  So  if  it is  taken  from  one  who  uses  it  contrary  to  the obedience of Allah, the practice of tawhīd and the  da’wah  to  worship  Him,  then  such  wealth becomes  the  most  beloved  of  wealth  to  Allah ta’ālā and the purest form of income in His sight.Also, he (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would not perform jihād except so that Allah’s word would be the highest and His religion the most manifest. He did not perform jihād for the sake of ghanīmah. So provision would come to him pursuant to his worship and jihād fī sabīlillāh. Therefore, he did not dedicate any of his time solely towards seeking provision.  Rather he would worship Allah in all his time, and practice tawhīd of Allah and be sincere to Him. So Allah made his provision easy during such worship, without him intending to seek it or endeavoring to pursue it.It was reported in the mursal narration (i.e. reported  with  no  mention  of  the  Sahābī  in  the \nisnād), that he (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “I am the messenger of mercy. I am the messenger of the malhamah (bloody battle). Allah sent me with jihād and He did not send me with agriculture” [reported by Ibn Sa’d in “at-Tabaqāt”].\nAl-Baghawī  reported  in  his  “Mu’jam”  a  marfū’ hadīth (i.e. a hadīth whose words are conveyed as  the  Prophet’s)  [that  the  Prophet  (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said], “Indeed Allah has sent me with guidance and the religion of truth. He did not make me a farmer, nor a merchant, nor a shouter in the markets. And He placed my provision in my spear.”\nHe mentioned the spear rather than the sword so that it is not understood that he got provision from the ghanīmah wealth. Rather, his provision was  from  the  fay’  that  Allah  granted  him  from Khaybar and Fadak.\nFay’ is what the enemy leaves behind after fearfully fleeing, contrary to ghanīmah, which is taken  through  fighting  with  the  sword.  Therefore, mention of the spear more clearly indicates the acquirement  of  fay’,  because  the  spear  is  seen by the enemy from a distance, so he flees, and thus  he  flees  from  the  spear’s  shade  by  which fay’ is taken. The provision of the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was from fay’, not ghanīmah, which is taken by fighting with a sword. And Allah knows best.\ndabiq\filies. Because of the Arabic terminologies used by this group either to describe themselves or their beliefs, some contemporary Muslim scholars  have  classified  them  as  possibly  an  apostate sect, not an originally mushrik religion, but upon  further  research,  it  was  determined  that this  group  is  one  that  existed  since  the  pre-Islamic jāhiliyyah, but became “Islamized” by the surrounding Muslim population, language, and culture, although they never accepted Islam nor claimed to have adopted it. The apparent origin of the religion is found in the Magianism of ancient Persia, but reinterpreted with elements of Sabianism,  Judaism,  and  Christianity,  and  ultimately expressed in the heretical vocabulary of extreme Sufism.\nAccordingly,  the  Islamic  State  dealt  with  this group  as  the  majority  of  fuqahā’  have  indicated how mushrikīn should be dealt with. Unlike the Jews and Christians, there was no room for jizyah payment. Also, their women could be enslaved unlike female apostates who the majority of the fuqahā’ say cannot be enslaved1  and can only be given an ultimatum to repent or face the sword. After capture, the Yazidi women and children were then divided according to the Sharī’ah amongst  the  fighters  of  the  Islamic  State  who participated in the Sinjar operations, after one fifth of the slaves were transferred to the Islamic State’s authority to be divided as khums.\nThis large-scale enslavement of mushrik families is probably the first since the abandonment of this Sharī’ah law. The only other known case – albeit much smaller – is that of the enslavement of  Christian  women  and  children  in  the  Philippines and Nigeria by the mujāhidīn there.\nThe enslaved Yazidi families are now sold by the Islamic State soldiers as the mushrikīn were sold by the Companions (radiyallāhu ‘anhum) before _____________1     The enslavement of the apostate women belonging to apostate groups such as the rāfidah, nusayriyyah, durūz, and ismā’īliyyah is one that the fuqahā’ differ over. The majority of the scholars say that their women are not to be enslaved and only ordered to repent because of the hadīth, “Kill whoever changes his religion” [Sahīh al-Bukhārī]. But some of the scholars including Shaykhul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah and the Ahnāf (Hanafis) say they may be enslaved  due  to  the  actions  of  the  Companions  during  the  Wars  of  Apostasy where they enslaved the apostate women. This opinion is one also supported by evidence, wallāhu a’lam.\nthem.  Many  well-known  rulings  are  observed, including the prohibition of separating a mother from her young children. Many of the mushrik women and children have willingly accepted Islam and now race to practice it with evident sincerity after their exit from the darkness of shirk.\nRasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  said, “Allah marvels at a people who enter Jannah in chains” [reported by al-Bukhārī on the authority of Abū Hurayrah]. The hadīth commentators mentioned that this refers to people entering Islam as slaves and then entering Jannah.\nAbū Hurayrah (radiyallāhu ‘anh) said while commenting on Allah’s words, {You are the best nation  produced  for  mankind}  [Āli  ‘Imrān:  110], “You are the best people for people. You bring them with chains around their necks, until they enter Islam” [Sahīh al-Bukhāri].\nYAZIDIS EMBRACE ISLAM\nAfter this discussion and as we approach al-Malhamah al-Kubrā (the greatest battle before the Hour) – whenever its time comes by Allah’s decree – it is interesting to note that slavery has been mentioned as one of the signs of the Hour as well as one of the causes behind al-Malhamah al-Kubrā.\nRasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  mentioned that one of the signs of the Hour was that “the slave girl gives birth to her master.” This was  reported  by  al-Bukhārī  and  Muslim  on the authority of Abū Hurayrah and by Muslim on the authority of ‘Umar.\ndabiq\f"

ISIL’s murder of two US journalists outraged the American people and exposed to the world the depravity of ISIL’s ideology and tactics.  Over the weekend, we saw ISIL’s murder of a British citizen. ISIL now controls a vast swath of eastern Syria and western and northern Iraq including towns and cities in all these areas.\nISIL has gained strength by exploiting the civil war in Syria and sectarian strife in Iraq.  And it has seized territory  across  both  countries  and  acquired  significant resources and advanced weapons. ISIL has employed a violent combination of terrorist, insurgent and conventional military tactics.\nISIL has been very adept at deploying technology and social media to increase its global profile and attract tens  of  thousands  of  fighters.  Its  goal  is  to  become the  new  vanguard  of  a  global  extremist  movement and establish an extremist Islamic caliphate across the Middle East. It considers itself the rightful inheritor of Osama bin Laden’s legacy.\nWhile ISIL clearly poses an immediate threat to American  citizens  in  Iraq  and  our  interests  in  the  Middle East, we also know that thousands of foreign fighters, including  Europeans  and  more  than  100  Americans have travelled to Syria.  With passports that give them relative freedom of movement, these fighters can exploit ISIL’s safe haven to plan, coordinate and carry out attacks against the United States and Europe.\nAlthough the intelligence community has not yet detected specific plotting against the US homeland, ISIL has  global  aspirations.  And  as  President  Obama  has made clear, ISIL’s leaders have threatened America and our allies. If left unchecked, ISIL will directly threaten our homeland and our allies.\n”\n\fSPECIAL\nTo Mom,\nI  do  not  have  much  time  and  will  probably  not get this opportunity again, so I would like to get straight to the point.\nYour recent public video of pleading to the Caliphate not to kill me has been received loud and clear by them. However, this in itself is not enough to save me. Although I’ve been informed that the aerial campaign in Iraq has been halted, which at the moment has given me breathing room thanks be to God, I believe it looks like it’s not enough Mom because Obama’s recent decision to fly spy drones over Syria in the Islamic State’s airspace is only aggravating and infuriating my captors further. This is obviously because the US government is interfering yet again in the affairs of the Islamic State. As for me being a journalist, they know this. I’ve repeatedly told them this, but like they always say, do US airstrikes differentiate between those who are armed and those who are unarmed? Likewise they don’t. Beseeching the Caliphate to spare my life will not help either of us, as the matter is in Obama’s  next  judgment.  As  you  and  the  world have plainly seen in the recent video, the message was my life depends on Obama’s next decision.\nMom, please don’t let Obama kill me. Do not let him  get  away  with  murder  again.  What  doesn’t our government understand? Don’t get involved in the Islamic State’s internal and external affairs. Leave them to fight their own war.\nMom, you can still save my life, just like the families of my previous cellmates who I’m sure you’ve met.  Pressure  our  government  to  not  involve themselves in the affairs of these people.\nAt the rate that Obama’s administration is going, this could very well be the last you hear from me. Please don’t let that be the case. Fight for me.I love you.\n[End of Message]\n\f"

A country, I called it. I know nothing about nation building. I’m so foolish I never even made it to university. But after dismissing some of the things I’ve written in the past as “ISIS propaganda,” many journalists and scholars in the West are now agreeing with this sentiment. The Islamic State, they say, is a genuine state.\nThis reality of the Caliphate is confirmed by many things, the people living under its governance, for one. For the first time in years, Muslims are living in security and their businesses  are  doing  a  roaring  trade.  The  zakāh  system has been up and running, taking a percentage of peoples’ wealth and dispersing it to the poor. The gold dinar coins \nfirst mentioned a year ago are now being minted, in preparation for their circulation. Sharī’ah courts are established in every city and are judging by the laws of Islam. Corruption, before an unavoidable fact of life in both Iraq and Syria, has been cut to virtually nil while crime rates have considerably tumbled.\nMeanwhile the Gulf states all around are in turmoil. They are  broken  by  religious  differences  and  fractured  by  ancient tribal feuds. The “Middle East … is broken, angry and so dysfunctional that it’s in a class all by itself, giving new meaning to the word ‘hopeless,’” wrote scholar Aaron David Miller in Foreign Policy on 11th September. “It is so torn apart and riven with sectarian, political, and religious hatreds and confrontations that it seems beyond the capacity of any external party to remedy.” It’s precisely for reasons like this that the Islamic State has arisen so fast and in such a short space of time. There is only one sect here, Sunni Islam, and the Caliph can only be from one tribe, Quraysh. Here in the Caliphate, there is no room for pluralism.\nIn an article published in The Telegraph on 8th June, Ruth Sherlock wrote, “The jihadists have become fastidious bu-\n4747\nPARADIGM SHIFT: PART II\n\f"

What he is saying is that British Muslims make a great contribution to our country, that what is happening in terms of extremist terror has nothing to do with the true religion of Islam. It’s being perverted by a minority who have been radicalized. Frankly, all of us have a responsibility to try and confront this  radicalization,  and  make  sure  we  stop young people being drawn into this poisonous, fanatical death cult that a very small minority of people have created.”\nWow.\nTHE CRUSADER ERIC PICKLES\n“British values are Muslim values,” he blurted, clearly having no idea what he was talking about, before hastily adding that Islam’s “message of peace and unity” makes the country better and stronger.\nWhat we have here are two people, politicians with a tremendous amount of power, who do not  have  the  slightest  idea  what  they’re  on about. They clearly have little knowledge about Islam, the Sharī’ah, jihād, the mujāhidīn, or why Muslims are getting angrier and angrier about how the West arrogantly pushes and shoves its \ndabiq\n\f"

        "@value": "The  past  year  has  seen  a  number  of  high-profile  racerelated  incidents  dominate  the  headlines  in  America, bringing  the  topic  of  racism  back  into  the  spotlight across the country, and like most other major issues that take center stage in the crusader media, racism does not go ignored by the Muslim minority living in the lands of kufr. Their “leaders” address the issue with an effort to  give  the  topic  an  “Islamic”  flavor,  but  typically  fall short. When tackling the issue from such a perspective, “Islamic”  preachers  and  writers  often  do  so  with humanistic  undertones  that  seek  to  portray  Islam  as  a religion of peace that teaches Muslims to coexist with all. Deluded by the open-ended concept of “tolerance,” they cite numerous āyāt and ahādīth that – rightfully so – serve to demonstrate that racial hatred has no place in Islam, but they do so for the purpose of advancing an agenda that attempts to “Islamize” more “liberal” concepts that the  kuffār  apply  across  the  board  for  achieving  evil, such  as  political  pluralism,  freedom  of  religion  ,  and acceptance of sodomites. In doing so, these “du’āt” seek to encourage the kāfir societies they live in to be more accepting of them, rather than meeting the enmity of the mushrikīn with hatred and disavowal. They forego the concept of walā’ and barā’ (loyalty and disavowal for the cause of Allah), not bothering to educate their readers of the Muslim’s obligation to reject kufr, separate himself from the kuffār, abandon their lands, harbor enmity and hatred towards them, and wage war against them until they submit to the truth.\n{There has already been for you an excellent pattern in Ibrāhīm  and  those  with  him,  when  they  said  to  their people,  “Indeed,  we  are  disassociated  from  you  and from whatever you worship other than Allah. We have denied you, and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone”} [Al-Mumtahanah: 4].\nThe example of Ibrāhīm  and those with him – meaning the prophets of Allah, as mentioned by the scholars of tafsīr – which was praised by Allah as being an excellent example  for  us  to  follow,  is  for  one  to  be  prepared  to reject his own people when they fall into kufr and shirk, and not to remain attached to them on account of tribal or blood ties. If this is the case with one’s own people with whom a common lineage is shared, how much more so in the case of those with whom one shares nothing more than a superficial characteristic such as skin color!\nThus,  the  correct  way  to  approach  the  issue  of  racism from an Islamic perspective is to reassert the importance and significance of walā’ and barā’, and to state in clear and unequivocal terms that those who wage war against \nIslam and the Muslims will not be spared on account of their skin color or ethnicity. The fate of a kāfir waging war against the Muslims is one and the same across the entire racial spectrum – slaughter.\nThe  reason  for  this  is  simple:  A  Muslim’s  loyalty  is determined, not by his skin color, his tribal affiliation, or his last name, but by his faith. He loves those whom Allah loves and hates those whom Allah hates. He forges alliances for the cause of Allah and breaks relations for the cause of Allah. \nThe  mufassir  of  the  Ummah,  ‘Abdullāh  Ibn  ‘Abbās   said,  “Love  for  the  sake  of  Allah,  hate  for  the  sake  of Allah, make allegiance for the sake of Allah, and make enemies  for  the  sake  of  Allah,  for  the  wilāyah  (loving guardianship) of Allah is not attained except by this. One will  not  find  the  taste  of  īmān,  even  if  his  prayer  and fasting is great, until he is like this” [Reported by Ibn alMubārak in “Az-Zuhd” and by al-Lālikā’ī].\nThis  statement  of  Ibn  ‘Abbās  echoes  that  made  by  the Prophet    when  declaring  walā’  and  barā’  to  be  the strongest bond of faith. Al-Barā’ Ibn ‘Āzib  said that they were sitting with the Prophet  when he  asked, “What bond of Islam is the strongest?” They said, “The prayer.” He  said, “It is good, but it is not it.” They said, “The zakāh.” He  said, “It is good, but it is not it.” They said, “Fasting Ramadān.” He  said, “It is good, but it is not it.” They said, “The hajj.” He  said, “It is good, but it is not it.” They said, “Jihād.” He  said, “It is good, but it is not it. Indeed, the strongest bond of Islam is to love for the sake of Allah and hate for the sake of Allah” [Reported by Imām Ahmad and others].\nIt was this principle – the strongest and most firm bond of Islam – that led Abū Bakr as-Siddīq  to spend an enormous  quantity  of  wealth  in  order  to  purchase  the Ethiopian slave Bilāl  and set him free. When Bilāl’s owner  Umayyah  ridiculed  Abū  Bakr  at  the  conclusion of the transaction stating that he would have sold him for  one  tenth  of  the  price  they’d  agreed  on,  Abū  Bakr retorted that if Umayyah had demanded ten times the agreed price he would have paid it. Years later, Abū Bakr and 300 other Arabs would march forth in the Battle of Badr  alongside  the  former  Ethiopian  slave  striking  the necks of their own people. That day would be referred thereafter  as  the  Day  of  Furqān,  the  day  that  Allah divided between truth and falsehood at the hands of a people who slay and imprison their own people for the cause of Allah. No day before it made it more clear that all past affiliations were broken, leaving only one bond remaining – the bond between a believing Muslim and \ndabiq\n\fquoted above as well as in the discussion between Salamah Ibn  al-Akwa’    and  al-Hajjāj  on  becoming  a  Bedouin after  hijrah  [Reported  by  al-Bukhārī  and  Muslim],  in addition  to  other  ahādīth  and  āthār,  returning  to  the desert as a Bedouin is referred to with the word root of “riddah.” Ibn al-Athīr commented, “They [the Salaf] used to consider the person who after his hijrah returns to his homeland without excuse like a murtadd” [An-Nihāyah]. This is probably because such a person – in some regards –  forsakes  aspects  of  Islam  including  hearing,  obeying, jamā’ah, jihād, masājid, etc. \nAnd  according  to  some  scholars,  moving  to  dārul-kufr from Dārul-Islām is apostasy, whereas others confirm that it borders apostasy.\nMany Syrians died on the roadto dārul-kufr\nIbn Mas’ūd  said, “The taker, giver, and contractor of ribā – if they know the deal is ribā – as well as the giver and receiver of tattoos for beauty, the abandoner of zakāh, and the revert to being a Bedouin after hijrah are all cursed upon  the  tongue  of  Muhammad    until  Resurrection Day” [Reported by an-Nasā’ī from Ibn Mas’ūd].\nIbn  Hazm  said,  “If  he  moves  there  [the  lands  of  the crusaders  and  pagans]  for  the  sake  of  what  he  might acquire from dunyā but lives there like a dhimmī – despite being able to join the body of the Muslims and reach their land – then his deed is not far from kufr and we find no excuse for him” [Al-Muhallā].\nThe  Prophet    said,  “The  muhājir  can  stay  three  days in Makkah after completing his [‘Umrah or Hajj] rites” [Reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim from al-‘Alā’ Ibn alHadramī].\nAl-Hasan Ibn Hayy (died 169AH) said, “If a man moves to  dārul-harb  without  apostatizing  from  Islam,  he  is  a murtadd for abandoning Dārul-Islām” [Mukhtasar Ikhtilāf al-‘Ulamā’ – at-Tahāwī].\n‘Alī  Ibn  Abī Tālib    said,  “Indeed,  the  major  sins  are seven.” The people were noisy, so he repeated his statement three times and then said, “Will you not ask me about them?” They said, “O Amīrul-Mu’minīn, what are they?” He replied, “Shirk, murder, defaming the chaste woman, taking the wealth of the orphan, taking ribā, fleeing from battle,  and  going  back  to  the  desert  as  a  Bedouin  after hijrah” [Reported by at-Tabarī in his tafsīr].\nAl-Qādī  ‘Iyād  said,  “The  Ummah  has  ijmā’  on  the prohibition  of  the  muhājir  abandoning  his  hijrah  and returning  to  his  homeland  and  that  the  muhājir  going back  to  being  a  Bedouin  is  a  major  sin”  [Sharh  Sahīh Muslim – an-Nawawī].\nIbn  Hajar  said  while  commenting  on  the  hadīth  of  al‘Alā’  Ibn  al-Hadramī  quoted  above,  “From  the  fiqh  of this  hadīth  is  that  residence  in  Makkah  was  harām  for those who performed hijrah from it before the Conquest of Makkah. But it was permissible for one who intended it for Hajj or ‘Umrah to remain there for not more than three days after completing his rites” [Fath al-Bārī].\nIt is important to note that in the hadīth of Ibn Mas’ūd  \nGoing  back  to  dārul-kufr  is  certainly  a  major  sin  that can reach the level of apostasy if it entails, for example, voluntarily  moving  to  a  land  where  the  person  will  be forced  into  kufr,  as  the  excuse  of  coercion  is  not  valid when the individual brings this condition upon himself. Similarly is the case if he agrees to stipulations of kufr – such as cooperating with the kuffār against the Muslims – so as to be permitted entry into dārul-kufr. This is kufr even if he does not go through with his promise. {Have you not considered those who practice hypocrisy, saying to their brothers who have disbelieved among the People of the Book, “If you are expelled, we will surely leave with you, and we will not obey, in regard to you, anyone – ever; and if you are fought, we will surely aid you.” But Allah testifies that they are liars. If they are expelled, they will not leave with them, and if they are fought, they will not aid them. And [even] if they should aid them, they will surely turn their backs; then [thereafter] they will not be aided} [Al-Hashr: 11-12]. And there are many other acts of kufr that one can potentially fall into when travelling to dārul-kufr.\nMay Allah facilitate for the Muslims hijrah to the Khilāfah despite the plots of the crusaders and the apostates.\ndabiq\n\f"

        "@value": "ADVICE FOR THE LEADERS OF THE ISLAMIC STATE\nPraise be to Allah, and may blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah, and upon his family and those who support him. As for what follows…\nMy dear mujāhid brother, these are some pieces of advice that I’ve gathered from the mouths of men and the pages of books, although I do not claim to be a man of wisdom. I ask Allah to make you and me benefit from these pieces of advice. And Allah knows all intentions. [1]  Have  sincerity  towards  Allah,  for  it  will lead  to  salvation  in  the  worldly  life  and  the Hereafter. Allah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “Allah has guaranteed the one who  performs  jihād  for  His  cause,  having  left his home for no reason other than to perform jihād for His cause and to affirm the truth of His words, that He would enter him into Jannah or return him back home with all the rewards he has attained or the ghanīmah he has acquired.”\nLet  the  goal  of  your  deed  be  that  the  word of  Allah  becomes  the  highest,  for  Abū  Mūsa said,  “Allah’s  Messenger  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa sallam) was asked about a man who fights out of bravery, out of zeal, or out of riyā’ (showing off), which of these is fighting for Allah’s cause? So  Allah’s  Messenger  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa sallam) said, ‘Whoever fights so that the word of  Allah  is  the  highest  is  fighting  for  Allah’s cause.’” [2] Be just and sincere towards your subjects, for  “No  man  is  appointed  to  lead  ten  people except that he will be brought forth in shackles on the Day of Judgment, and will either be set free on account of his justice or destroyed as a result of his oppression.” Likewise, “Any leader who takes charge of the affairs of the Muslims and  then  doesn’t  strive  for  them  and  advise them,  will  not  enter  Jannah  with  them.”  And likewise, “Allah does not give one of His slaves leadership,  who  then  dies  having  cheated  his subjects,  except  that  Allah  will  make  Jannah prohibited for him.”\n10 ARTICLE10 ARTICLE\n[3] Seek consultation and hold discussions, for discussion is the partner of consultation. One should sit in a gathering to exchange ideas, then each  person  comments  on  the  opinions  put forth by the others, or puts forth a new opinion, and  at  the  end  of  the  gathering  the  correct opinion  will  become  clear.  Allah  (ta’ālā)  said, {And consult them concerning the matter} [Āl ‘Imrān: 159]. Allah has directed His Prophet to consult those under him despite the Prophet’s prudent intellect. So what about you?\nAnd  as  was  reported,  “One  who  seeks consultation will have no regret, and one who prays  istikhārah  will  not  go  wrong.”  And  it’s been  said,  “He  who  relies  exclusively  on  his intellect will go astray, and he who is content with his own opinion will slip up, and he who consults  intelligent  men  will  take  the  correct path, and he who seeks the help of a man with insight will attain what is hoped for.”\nSo  let  every  leader  have  a  true  consultative council beginning with the general leader and ending with the detachment commanders. But do not consult a person who has a certain need that he is seeking to fulfill, nor a person whom you sense desires to be consulted, nor a person who doesn’t think his opinions through, for it’s been said, “Leave your opinion until it ripens.” It was reported that ‘Alī said, “The opinion of an elder is better than the view of a young man,” meaning  with  regards  to  battle.  And  don’t consult  anyone  unless  he’s  alone,  meaning that you should consult him in private, for this ensures more secrecy and is a greater deterrent to  anyone  who  might  otherwise  disclose  the issue.\nIt is true! “Consultation and discussion are two doors to mercy, and two keys to blessings. No opinion  that’s  been  reached  with  the  help  of these two things will go wrong.”\n[4]  Beware  of  only  consulting  a  person  who always  agrees  with  your  opinion,  and  beware of  bad  company.  Get  accustomed  to  being \n\fwhom  Allah  does  not  guide  is  deviant,  anyone whom He does not decree wellbeing for is afflicted, and anyone whom Allah does not aid is abandoned. So whomever Allah guides is guided and whomever He leaves astray is deviant. Allah (ta’ālā) said, {He whom  Allah  guides  is  the  guided,  but  he  whom He  leaves  astray  –  never  will  you  find  for  him  a protecting guide} [Al-Kahf: 17], and no deed will be accepted  from  him  in  the  Dunyā  until  he  accepts Him. And no repentance or ransom will be accepted from him in the Hereafter. It has reached me that some of you turned back from their religion after accepting  Islam  and  acting  in  accordance  with  it, out of delusion about Allah, ignorance of His affair, and in response to Shaytān. Allah (ta’ālā) said, {And [mention] when We said to the angels, “Prostrate to Ādam,” and they prostrated, except for Iblīs. He was of the jinn and departed from the command of his Lord. Then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than Me while they are enemies to you? Wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange} [Al-Kahf:  50].  And  He  said,  {Indeed,  Shaytān  is  an enemy  to  you;  so  take  him  as  an  enemy.  He  only invites his party to be among the companions of the Blaze} [Fātir: 6]. I have sent to you so and so [Khālid Ibn  al-Walīd]  with  an  army  of  the  Muhājirīn,  the Ansār,  and  their  good  followers,  and  I’ve  ordered him to not fight anyone or kill anyone until he calls him  to  the  call  of  Allah.  Whoever  answers  him, accepts the truth, halts his evil, and does good, my envoy will accept this from him and will aid him in it. If he refuses, I’ve ordered him to wage war against them over their refusal, to not spare anyone he is able to kill, to burn them alive with fire, to kill them in a severe manner using all means, to enslave their women  and  children,  and  to  not  accept  from  any one of them anything but Islam. Whoever follows it, then it is best for him. And whoever leaves it, then he cannot incapacitate Allah. I’ve ordered my envoy to read this message in every gathering of yours and the signal is the adhān. [I’ve said to my army] if the Muslims perform adhān and they [the apostates] do not perform adhān, then rush to kill them. And if they [the apostates] perform adhān, then restrain yourselves from attacking them until you ask them to deliver what is obligatory upon them [the zakāh]. If they refuse, then rush to kill them. If they agree, it  will  be  accepted  from  them,  and  my  envoy  will make them carry out their duties.\nA FEEBLE PLEA FROM THE KHALAF TO THE TAWĀGHĪT!\n(From adh-Dhawāhirī to the Tāghūt Morsi)\nAs  for  my  message  to  Doctor  Muhammad  Morsi, then I say to him: first of all, I ask Allah to relieve you of your suffering, guide your heart, and rectify for  you  your  religion  and  worldly  affair.  I  also  ask Allah  to  keep  your  heart  firm,  fill  your  heart  with certainty, faith, and firmness, so that you support His  religion  and  law  without  fear  or  compromise, and  that  He  bestows  you  with  adherence  to  the statement  of  al-Mustafā  (sallallāhu ‘alayhi  wa sallam), “The best jihād is a word of truth in front of an unjust ruler” and his statement (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam), “The leader of martyrs is Hamzah Ibn ‘Abdil-Muttalib and a man who confronts an unjust ruler, orders him with good, and prohibits him from evil,  and  so  the  ruler  kills  him.”  And  I  advise  you while sincerely directing this advice towards you and hoping for your guidance, success, and firmness. So I say, you dealt with the secularists and assented to them,  with  the  crusaders  and  conceded  to  them, with the Americans and gave them guarantees, with the Israelis and recognized the submissive treaties with them, with Mubārak’s army who were raised upon American aid and you assented to them, and \nIF I WERE IN THE PLACE OF MORSI AND SAT ON THE KURSĪ [THRONE]\n BY HUSĀM ‘ABDUR-RA’ŪF\n[Tārīkh at-Tabarī; Al-Bidāyah wan-Nihāyah]\nA DEVIANT BOOK WRITTEN BY A TOP LEADER OF AL-QĀ´IDAH!\n18 HISTORY\n\f"

The nature and significance of the threat flow from the fact that ISIS is – all at the same time – a terrorist group, a state and a revolutionary political movement. We have never faced an adversary like it.”\n“As a terrorist group, ISIS poses a threat to the homeland. That threat is largely indirect and involves ISIS’s ability to radicalize  young  Americans  to  conduct  attacks  here.  The FBI has over 900 open investigations into homegrown extremists, the vast majority radicalized by ISIS, and a large number  of  those  investigations  relate  to  individuals  who may be plotting here…”\n“[T]he potential exists for the quantity of … [homegrown] attacks to be large. The number of ISIS followers dwarfs the number of followers that al-Qaeda ever had. Over time, the indirect threat, if not significantly degraded, will become a direct one – that is, ISIS will have the ability to plan and direct attacks on the homeland from the group’s safe havens in Iraq and Syria, just like it did in Paris.”\n“Such attacks are deeply concerning because they carry the potential to be much more sophisticated and complex – and therefore more dangerous – than homegrown attacks, again,  just  like  in  Paris  recently,  or  London  in  2005  or even 9/11. And in news that should get everyone’s attention, ISIS has shown an interest in weapons of mass destruction.”\n“The attacks in Paris were the first manifestation of an effort by ISIS to put together an attack capability in Europe – an effort it began less than a year ago. The head of the U.K.’s domestic security agency recently warned that ISIS is now planning mass-casualty attacks in Britain. His concerns are well-founded. We will not be far behind.”\n“As a state, ISIS poses a threat to regional stability – a threat to the very territorial integrity of the current nation-states, a threat to inflame the entire region in sectarian war…”\n“As a revolutionary political movement, ISIS is gaining affiliates among extremist groups around the world. They are signing up for what ISIS desires as its objective: a global caliphate where day-to-day life is governed by extreme religious views. In the mind of ISIS, its global caliphate would extend to the U.S.”\n“When they join ISIS, these affiliates evolve from focusing on local issues to focusing on establishing an extension of the caliphate. And their targets evolve from local to international ones. This is the story of the bombing of the Russian airline by an ISIS group in the Egyptian Sinai.”\n“ISIS  has  gained  affiliates  faster  than  al-Qaeda  ever  did. From none a year ago, there are now militant groups that have sworn allegiance to ISIS in nearly 20 countries. They have conducted attacks that have killed Americans, and they carry the potential to grab large amounts of territory…”\nMorell ended his article saying:\n“Mr. President, the downing of the Russian airliner and the attacks in Paris make it crystal clear that our ISIS strategy is not working.”\nYes, the crusader strategy is not working because the Islamic State is here to stay. It is a state that inflicts just terror against its infidel, pagan, and apostate enemies. And it will continue to expand until its banner flutters over Constantinople and Rome. Until then, let the crusaders get used to the sound of explosion and the image of carnage in their very own homelands.\nSan  Bernardino  was  not  the  first, and by Allah’s permission it will not be  the  last\n\fThis month, Dābiq interviewed the Wālī of Khurāsān Shaykh  Hāfidh  Sa’īd  Khān  (hafidhahullāh)  and  asked him  several  questions  regarding  the  Wilāyah  and  the situation on the ground there. We present the interview below.\nDābiq: How is the situation in Wilāyat Khurāsān? Does the Islamic State have territory there with tamkīn (consolidation)? Are the visible aspects of tamkīn there similar to what is manifest in Shām and Iraq?\nThe Wālī: Alhamdulillāh, the situation in Khurāsān brings good  tidings,  by  Allah’s  permission.  We  have  achieved tamkīn in the Wilāyah, but not on the same level as Iraq and Shām in terms of the magnitude of territory on the ground. The lands of Khurāsān are very vast and include “Afghanistan,” western “Pakistan,” and other lands that the murtaddīn had taken over. We have conquered and gained consolidation in five “administrative regions” here, walhamdulillāh, and in terms of the visible aspects of tamkīn, we – by Allah’s grace – establish Allah’s law therein and implement the hudūd. We have established judicial courts in these regions, offices for hisbah, offices for zakāh, and others for education, da’wah and masājid, and public services. We set up a specific division for every shar’ī and administrative duty therein and appointed qualified and specialized officials based on the personnel available from amongst the muhājirīn and ansār in the Wilāyah.\nThe hisbah in Wilāyat Khurāsān leveling graves\nDābiq: What is the importance of Wilāyat Khurāsān to Islam and the Muslims? What are the difficulties the Wilāyah faces?\nThe Wālī: Wilāyat Khurāsān has great importance to Islam and the Muslims. It had once been under the authority of the Muslims, along with the regions surrounding it. Afterwards, the secularist and Rāfidī murtaddīn conquered some  of  these  regions,  and  the  cow-worshipping  Hindus and atheist Chinese conquered other nearby regions, as is the case in parts of Kashmir and Turkistan. So the Wilāyah, \nby Allah’s permission, is a gate to re-conquering all these regions until they are ruled once more by Allah’s law, and so the territory of the blessed Khilāfah is expanded.\nAlso, the people of Khurāsān in general love Islam and warfare, and because of this, the region has a dormant force for supporting tawhīd and jihād. Thus, as the reality of the Khilāfah becomes more clear to the people of Khurāsān, they will join the Wilāyah at a greater rate and strengthen its jihād against the enemies of Islam and the Muslims, including the kuffār, the murtaddīn, and those who ally with them inside and outside the region. As such, they will be a strong building block for the Khilāfah in this part of the world. And the coming generations will be raised upon the Book and the Sunnah from a young age. This is a tremendous grace that has reached this region by way of this khilāfah, which is upon the prophetic methodology, and by way of our imām and khalīfah, Abū Bakr al-Baghdādī al-Qurashī.\nAs for the difficulties, then they are nothing but the tāghūt enemies of Allah – including “Pakistan” on one side, and “Afghanistan”  on  the  other  –  standing  with  their  armies and intelligence agencies against Islam, its khilāfah, and the wilāyah that represents it and implements its methodology in the region. These two governments attempt to create  many  problems  in  order  to  obstruct  the  jihād  of  the Wilāyah and thereby hinder the establishment of Islam and its methodology in the region. They attempt to stop the expansion  of  the  Khilāfah.  Such  is  also  the  condition  of those organizations that these two governments produce, support, or take advantage of, and to whom they extend aid, and for whom they pave the way. This leads these organizations, such as the nationalist Taliban movement, to instigate various problems in order to wage war against the Khilāfah. But how impossible it is for all these organizations and others to extinguish the light of Allah! For this is a khilāfah that rose upon the prophetic methodology and upon the foundation of tawhīd, thus all these tawāghīt together will not be able to stand before its lions – the lions of tawhīd and ‘aqīdah. The tawāghīt succeeded against the “Islamic” organizations and movements that held flimsy creeds and deficient methodologies, whether they were “da’wah”-oriented or “jihād”-oriented. As for the Khilāfah, it is a thorn – rather, an axe! – in the necks of the kuffār and murtaddīn in this region, by Allah’s power and strength.\nDābiq: Does the nationalist Taliban movement have areas of consolidation in Khurāsān? And do they rule them by Allah’s law?\nThe  Wālī:  The  nationalist  Taliban  movement  only  has control  of  some  regions  of  “Afghanistan,”  nowhere  else. As for ruling them by Allah’s law, then it does not do that. Rather, they rule by tribal customs and judge affairs in accordance with the desires and traditions of the people, tra-\n\f"

And  whoever is an ally to them among you – then indeed,  he  is  one  of  them.

In reality, a cold media war is being fought  between  the  two  over  their love  of  leadership  and  pride  in opinions,  and  as  its  ice  melts,  the two sides will begin to dispatch their security  cells  to  silently  target  each other’s  leadership  with  IED’s  and silencers, that is if this hasn’t already \nthe  apostates begun.

It will take more than bombs from the West to defeat this menace.” In it he said:\n“In  Raqqa  …  people  were  taking notice  [of  “the  West’s  inaction”]. The  so-called  Islamic  State  (Isil), then only a pale shadow of what it 2 See page 75 of issue #10 of Dābiq.3 His previous article was quoted on pages 12-13 of issue #10 of Dābiq.\nThe Turkish sponsors of al-Qā’idah’s allies stand in the same trench as the NATO crusaders\nis  today,  capitalised  on  the  West’s failure to reign-in Assad to advance their  propaganda  narrative: the West  is  in  cahoots  with  Assad  and his  Shi’ite  Iranian  backers  in  a conspiracy  to  defeat  and  humiliate Sunni Arabs in the region. …”\n“[T]he majority of Syrians[’] … sole aims  in  revolution  was  freedom, dignity  and  a  better  quality  of  life.

Ahrar  Al-Sham  wants to see  the  end  to  Assad’s  reign,  Isil comprehensively  defeated  and  a stable and representative government in Damascus formed that puts Syria on the path to peace, reconciliation and  economic  recovery.

They are also divided about their dunyā and they consider this good. So he  came with unity regarding the religion with Allah’s statement, {He has ordained for you  of  religion  what  He  enjoined  upon  Nūh  and  that which We have revealed to you, and what We enjoined upon  Ibrāhīm  and  Mūsā  and  ‘Īsā  –  to  establish  the religion  and  not  be  divided  therein}  [Ash-Shūrā:  13]. Allah  also said, {Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become sects – you have nothing to do with them}  [Al-An’ām:  159].  He  also  prohibited  us  from being like them with Allah’s statement, {And do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them. And those will have a great punishment} [Āl ‘Imrān: 105]. He also prohibited us from dividing about the dunyā with Allah’s statement, {And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do  not  become  divided}  [Āl  ‘Imrān:  103].  The  third of these matters is that they considered disobeying the person in authority and refusing to yield to him a virtue. They considered hearing and obeying him humiliation and  disgrace.  Allah’s  Messenger    opposed  them  and ordered his companions to be patient with the injustices of the rulers2. He ordered them to hear and obey them and give them sincere advice. He was severe about this, expressed it, and repeated it. These three matters he  gathered together in the hadīth reported by al-Bukhārī and  Muslim,  ‘Allah  is  pleased  with  three  matters  for you, that you worship Him and not associate anything with Him in worship, that you hold to the rope of Allah together  and  not  divide,  and  that  you  sincerely  advise those whom Allah gives authority over you.’ No calamity occurred  in  the  people’s  religion  and  dunyā  except  by violation  of  these  three  principles  or  some  of  them” [Masā’il al-Jāhiliyyah].\nHe    also  said,  “From  the  most  amazing  things  and greatest  signs  showing  the  power  of  Allah    are  six principles  that  He    made  very  clear  more  so  than what  the  doubtful  people  think.  Thereafter,  many  of the  ‘intelligent’  people  of  the  world  and  ‘wise’  men  of mankind erred about these principles, except for a very few.  …  The  second  principle  [after  the  obligation  of tawhīd  and  prohibition  of  shirk]  is  that  Allah  ordered with unity regarding the religion and prohibited division within it. Allah clarified this with clear and conclusive evidence that the laymen can understand. He prohibited us from being like those who divided before us and thus were  destroyed.  He  also  mentioned  that  He  ordered the  Messengers  with  unity  regarding  the  religion  and 2 He refers to Muslim rulers who rule by the Sharī’ah but commit injustices, not rulers who apostatize by legislating, executing, or judging by manmade laws, nor rulers who have walā’ to the crusaders against the Muslims.\nprohibited  them  from  division  within  it.  What  makes this  clearer  is  what  the  Sunnah  came  with  of  amazing teachings in this regards. Then the matter changed until division  over  the  fundamentals  and  branches  of  the religion  became  ‘knowledge’  and  ‘fiqh  of  the  religion’! And  then  no  one  called  to  the  obligation  to  unite regarding the religion except for a ‘zindīq’ or ‘madman’! The third principle is that the fulfillment of unity is by hearing and obeying he who has been granted authority over  us  even  if  he  might  be  an  Ethiopian  slave.  Allah clarified this prevalently and sufficiently through various kinds of shar’ī and qadarī evidences. It then became the fundamental  not  known  to  most  of  the  claimants  of knowledge. What then of acting in accordance with this matter!” [Six Great Beneficial Fundamentals].\nAnd  although  jamā’ah  is  from  the  most  obvious  of obligations with even the fitrah of many animals being inclined to it, the modern claimants of Islam argue that it is better for the Ummah to have religious and political pluralism!  They  prefer  that  Ahlus-Sunnah  tolerate  the various  sects  of  bid’ah  and  even  apostasy  who  claim to belong to the Muslim Ummah. They also wish that Ahlus-Sunnah  would  permit  the  existence  of  deviant, warring, and selfish political parties and militant factions on the liberated Muslim lands! They made taqlīd (blind following)  of  their  partisan,  evil  “scholars”  an  essential aspect of “religion.” And through this, they propagated the  “virtue”  of  division  and  denounced  the  “evil”  of jamā’ah  in  their  campaign  against  the  revived  body  of Islam, the Khilāfah. How wicked are the deviant parties and corrupt “scholars”!\nTherefore  know  –  may  Allah  have  mercy  upon  you  – that  the  major  basis  for  the  religions  of  the  Jāhiliyyah was taqlīd. After Imām Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhāb   mentioned  the  first  three  aspects  of  their  religion (shirk, religious division, and political disunity), he said, “The fourth matter is that their religion is based upon principles, the greatest of which is taqlīd. It is the major principle for all the kuffār, the first of them and last of them, as Allah  said, {And similarly, We did not send before you any warner into a city except that its affluent said, “Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are, in their footsteps, following”} [Az-Zukhruf: 23]. He  also said, {And when it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has revealed,” they say, “Rather, we will follow that upon which we found our fathers.” Even if Shaytān was inviting them to the punishment of Hellfire?} [Luqmān: 21]. So he  came to them with Allah’s statement, {Say, “I only advise you of one thing – that you stand for Allah, [seeking truth] in pairs and individually, and then give thought.” There is not in your companion any madness. \ndabiq\n\f"

        "@value": "Muslims who set out to answer Shaykh al-‘Adnānī’s call to defend the Khilāfah often find themselves marching forward alone, with none to rely on for support in their efforts  to  defend  the  Sharī’ah  except  Allah.  The  jihād claimants, on the other hand, are relatively large groups of well-armed fighters that have the ability to take and hold  territory  and  impose  their  will.  Yet  they  refuse to  establish  the  rule  of  Allah  despite  the  strength  and consolidation that He has granted them.\nIn  further  contrast  between  the  sincere  muwahhidīn and  the  jihād  claimants,  one  can  see  that  the  likes  of the muwahiddīn who terrorized the kuffār on “Bloody Friday”  and  even  before  that,  are  typically  vilified  and made out to be extremists on the fringes of society, or individuals  suffering  from  poverty,  unemployment,  or other  social  issues.  Yet  they  persist  in  their  jihād,  not concerning themselves with how they will subsequently be portrayed in the sorcerous media or what the people would  say  about  them.  This  is  simply  because  they pursue  the  pleasure  of  Allah,  not  the  pleasure  of  the people.  The  cowardly  jihād  claimants,  in  comparison, with  their  large  numbers,  heavy  weaponry,  and    their claim of some regions of Shām, are nonetheless afraid of implementing the Sharī’ah lest they offend the people, therefore choosing instead to pursue the pleasure of the people over the pleasure of Allah.\nAllah’s Messenger  said, “Whoever pleases Allah at the expense of angering the people, Allah will be sufficient for him against the people’s harm, and whoever pleases the  people  at  the  expense  of  angering  Allah,  Allah will  [abandon  him  and]  leave  his  affair  to  the  people” [Reported by at-Tirmidhī from ‘Ā’ishah].\nThus we renew our call to the sincere Muslims around the world to march forth and wage war against the crusaders and apostates who seek to wipe out the Sharī’ah. March forth, neither fearing the blame of the critics, nor seeking the pleasure of the people, for the hukm belongs to Allah, not the people.\n{Legislation is not but for Allah} [Yūsuf: 40].\nThe crusader nation of Britainmourns its dead citizens\nThe scene outside the targeted Rāfidī temple in Kuwait\nAbū Sulaymān al-Muwahhid (may Allah accept him)\nAbū Yahyā al-Qayrawānī (may Allah accept him)\nday?

Rise and defend your state from your place wherever you may be” [Indeed Your Lord Is Ever Watchful].\nThe  call  to  defend  the  Islamic  State  –  the  only  state ruling  by  Allah’s  Sharī’ah  today  –  continues  to  be answered  by  sincere  Muslims  and  mujāhidīn  around the world prepared to sacrifice their lives and everything dear  to  them  to  raise  high  the  word  of  Allah  and trample  democracy  and  nationalism.  In  contrast,  the jihād claimants in Shām and other regions are prepared to sacrifice the principles of the religion and wage war against the Islamic State in defense of a jāhilī nationalism coated  with  a  thin  veneer  of  “Sharī’ah,”  knowing  full well  that  should  they  succeed  in  taking  any  territory from  the  Khilāfah,  that  territory  would  no  longer  be ruled by Allah’s pure Sharī’ah.\nTo  further  demonstrate  the  disgraceful  nature  of  these jihād  claimants,  one  only  needs  to  take  note  that  the \n4 FOREWORD\n\fgood question,’ said Joshua Landis, a Syria expert at  the  University  of  Oklahoma  who’s  written about  Alloush.  Alloush  and  his  staff  ‘are  getting much  more  savvy,’  he  said,  based  on  Twitter conversations  he’s  had  with  the  commander’s spokesman.”\n“‘Everybody is aware now that the regime is very weak  and  on  the  way  to  collapse,’  said  Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat who lives in Washington. ‘And every major player wants to be acceptable  to  the  West  and  to  the  international community.’”\n“‘Zahran  wants  to  be  on  the  winning  side,’  he said.”\n“Landis said Alloush would be there. ‘He’s going to be a winner,’ he said. Alloush’s Army of Islam and other  Islamist  groups,  the  ‘hard-bitten  patriotic types … will win in the end,’ he said.”\n“Presenting a new face may be one reason Alloush traveled  to  Istanbul,  where  he  was  interviewed, and  was  heading  next  to  Jordan  to  confer  with rebel commanders who operate in southern Syria, as well as their international backers. His fighters need weapons.”\n“In his interview with McClatchy, he adhered to the moderate line: ‘If we succeed in toppling the regime,  we  will  leave  it  to  the  Syrian  people  to choose the form of state they want,’ he said. ‘As for coexistence with minorities, this has been the situation in Syria for hundreds of years. We are not seeking to impose our power on minorities or to practice oppression against them. On the contrary, we have criticized the regime and fought it because it was practicing sectarian discrimination against the majority during the eras it ruled Syria.’”\n“Another  aide  said  that  Alloush,  to  improve  his image, was ready to dispense with the black and white Islamic flag and adopt the Syrian flag used by other rebel forces.”\n“[Zahran]  said  the  Army  of  Islam  had  been  in direct touch with Daniel Rubinstein, the Obama \nadministration’s  special  envoy assertion the State Department confirmed.”\nfor  Syria,  an \nThat  ends  the  words  of  Alloush’s  allies.  To summarize:  He  believes  in  self-determination,  a cornerstone of democracy. He believes in freedom of religion and religious coexistence, a cornerstone of  secularist  nationalism.  And  he  compromises religious fundamentals, meets with Jewish leaders part  of  the  crusade  against  Islam,  and  raises banners  of  secularist  jāhiliyyah  for  the  sake  of obtaining aid. And yet, Alloush has been one of the top allies of “al-Qā’idah” in Syria (the Jawlānī front) – openly having praised both Jawlānī and al-Harārī  (a  major  leader  of  the  Jawlānī  front) in  interviews  released  officially  by  his  “Army  of Islam.” He himself has been praised by al-Harārī via internet tweets.\nThe Jewish envoy Daniel Rubinstein,ally of Zahran Alloush\nAgain, the deviance of Alloush has been something known  to  these  jihād  claimants  long  before  this recent  interview  and  even  before  the  official expansion of the Islamic State to Shām, and yet the  Jawlānī  front  supported  the  “Islamic  Front” that  Alloush  led  in  the  war  against  the  Islamic State.1\nThis interview was followed by a declaration by the allies of the Jawlānī front condemning the Jawlānī front’s killing of more than twenty apostate Druze 1 A former member of Jawlānī’s shūrā council has also informed Dābiq that when Jawlānī was ordered by Dhawāhirī to join the apostate “Islamic” Front, he refused to do so, saying that Dhawāhirī was unaware of the situation on the ground. When Jawlānī was pressured by the former Ahrār ash-Shām leadership to follow Dhawāhirī’s order, he stipulated that Zahran Alloush be removed from the “Islamic” Front leadership, and yet he cooperated on numerous frontlines with the “Islamic” Front led by Alloush against the Islamic State since the beginning of the Sahwah?!\ndabiq\n\f"

They  succeeded in  capturing  several  points  where the murtaddin were entrenched after they fled in defeat.

On the 29th of Sha’ban, the soldiers  of  the  Khilafah  succeeded \nin  assassinating  Sunil  Gomes,  one of the Christian heads of disbelief. He was killed in the village of Bonpara in Northwest Bangladesh. On the 2nd of Ramadan, the soldiers of the Caliphate carried out a security operation in which they succeeded in killing a Hindu priest known as Ananta  Gopal  Ganguli  in  the  district of Jhenaidah in Western Bangladesh.  On  the  5th  of  Ramadan, the soldiers of the Caliphate assassinated a Hindu mushrik by stabbing him  with  knives.  On  the  27th  of Ramadan, five inghimasi soldiers of the Caliphate carried out an attack on the Artisan Restaurant, which is frequented  by  Crusader  foreigners of varying nationalities, in the city of  Dhaka.  The  mujahidin  held  a number of hostages as they engaged in a gun battle with apostate Bengali police, and succeeded in killing and injuring dozens of disbelievers before  attaining  shahadah.\nSomalia – On the 17th of Rajab,  the  soldiers  of  the  Caliphate detonated an explosive device on a military  vehicle  belonging  to  African  Crusader  forces  in  the  area  of Taridish in the city of Mogadishu, with the blast destroying part of the vehicle.

It is just as the Lord said, explaining this phenomenon of the majority’s rejection of the truth, “And most of mankind refuse [to follow anything] but disbelief” (Al-Isra 89).\nAs  is  well  known,  these  messengers did  not  come  empty-handed.  Each of  them  brought  with  him  a  message, often in the form of a scripture, something for the educated to read and comprehend, yet with the simple command of monotheistic worship of the Creator that even the illiterate could follow. So Moses  was  given  the Torah,  by  which the  Tribes  of  Israel  were  governed  for many  generations.  But  they  strayed from  its  original  message,  even  with their very own scribes changing its text, as the Tanakh1 testifies, “How can you say, ‘We are wise, and the law (Torah) of the Lord is with us’? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes has made it into a lie” (Jeremiah 8:8).2 So then Jesus brought the Gospel, confirming what came before him of the Torah and permitting – by the permission  of  his  Lord  –  some  of  what  was  forbidden therein. It was reported that he said, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them” (Matthew 5:17). However, just as the Torah was not fully preserved, even altered, the Gospel was also corrupted. Its original would be lost, with the oldest related manuscripts written only as commentary to the original. So instead of having an altered “Gospel of Jesus,” one finds the Gospel according to Matthew, then Mark, then Luke, then John, each with a unique take on various aspects of Jesus’ teachings, sometimes outright contradicting one another. To say the least, the authentic scripture was lost and the people strayed.As per the divine way of the Lord, another messenger was sent to bring the lost flocks back to the path of righteousness. He would be the awaited Prophet foretold by Moses and the coming Advocate prophesied by Jesus. Moreover, he would bring a message hold-\n1  The Tanakh are the Jewish scriptures consisting of three parts: the Law (Torah), the Prophets, and the Writings.2  Due to ease of reading, the English Standard Version of the Bible is used herein unless otherwise noted.\ning the promise of divine protection and heralding its bearer as the Seal of the Prophets, the final messenger, sent not to the Tribes of Israel alone – but to all of mankind. For the same Lord who sent Moses and Jesus  also  sent  Muhammad,  about  whom  He  said, “Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but [he is] the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets” (Al-Ahzab 40), and about whose message He said, “Verily We revealed the Reminder and verily We shall preserve it” (Al-Hijr 9).\nSeeking the Truth\nFalsehood should be rejected because it is false, just as the truth should be accepted and followed because it is true. It is not a matter of tradition, for the Lord has ordered that all nations be called to His worship.The pagan who feigns the excuse that religion is no more than family tradition should not be left to his deviance  without  receiving  proper  admonition.  No one should.\nLikewise, no nation – no matter how originally pure – is free of corruptive infiltrations. Even the nation of Muhammad g, as the years passed following his death, fell victim to various deviations in creed – some even reaching apostasy – at the hands of those who rejected  a  correct  understanding  of  faith,  of  Allah’s oneness, and of the divine law in general.

He called us to the oneness of Allah, ordering us to worship Him and abandon what we and our fathers were worshiping besides Him of stones and idols, and ordered us to be truthful in speech, to render trusts [to whom they are due], to mend family ties, to be good to our neighbors, and to withhold from forbidden matters and unlawful bloodshed, and he forbade upon us fornication, false speech, devouring an orphan’s wealth, and accusing chaste women of fornication. He commanded us to worship Allah alone and not make any partners  for  Him  in  worship  and  ordered  us  with prayer,  zakah  (charity),  and  fasting.  So  we  affirmed his truthfulness and believed in him, and we followed him in what he had brought us of Allah’s religion.”“We worshiped Allah alone, not making any partners for Him, prohibited what he forbade upon us, and  allowed  what  he  permitted  for  us,  so  our  people became hostile towards us. They tortured us and sought  to  turn  us  away  from  our  religion  through enticement and oppression in order to take us back to worshiping idols instead of Allah the Exalted, and to permitting the wicked things we used to permit. Thus, when they subjugated us, oppressed us, made things difficult for us, and stood between us and our religion, we left for your land. We chose you over others besides you, and we desired your protection and hoped that we would not be wronged in your presence, O king.”\nAshamah asked him, “Do you have anything of that which he has come with from Allah?” Ja’far replied, “Yes.” So Ashamah said, “Then read it to me.” So Ja’far read to him from the first section of Surat Maryam. Ashamah wept until his beard became wet and his patriarchs also wept until their books became wet when they heard what Ja’far recited to them. Ashamah then said,  “Indeed,  this  and  what  Jesus  came  with  have come  from  the  same  lamp.”  He  then  told  the  two representatives  from  Quraysh,  “Go,  for  by  Allah  I will not surrender them to you and they will not be harmed.” So they left, and ‘Amr said to ‘Abdullah, “By Allah, tomorrow I will bring to him something from them by which I will uproot their joy.”\nThe next day, ‘Amr said to Ashamah, “O king, they utter a tremendous statement concerning Jesus Son of Mary.”1 So Ashamah summoned Ja’far and the Muslims with him and asked them what they say about Jesus. Ja’far said, “We say about him like our prophet g taught us – that he is the slave of Allah, His messenger, His [chosen] spirit, and His word which He cast into the pure virgin Mary.” Ashamah then picked up a cane and said, “By Allah, Jesus Son of Mary does not exceed what you have mentioned so much as the length of this cane.” His patriarchs then snorted, so he said to them, “By Allah, even if you snort!” (Sirat Ibn Hisham).\nYears later, when the letter of the Prophet g reached him,  he  readily  declared  his  testimony  of  faith,  responding to the Prophet g with the following words:“In the Name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful. To Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, from Negus Ashamah: May Allah’s peace be upon you, O Prophet of Allah, as well as His mercy and blessings; there is no god but Allah.”\n“As for what follows: Your letter has reached me, O Messenger of Allah, including what you mentioned of the matter of Jesus. By the Lord of the heavens and the  earth,  Jesus  is  not  more  than  what  you  say.  Indeed, he is as you have stated. We have learned that with  which  you  have  been  sent  to  us,  and  we  have hosted your cousin and his companions. Thus, I bear witness, with truth and affirmation, that you are the Messenger of Allah, and I pledge allegiance to you. I have pledged allegiance to your cousin and, at his hands, have submitted to Allah, the Lord of creation” (Zad  al-Ma’ad).\nThus, after having been entrusted with the care and protection of the noble family and companions of the Prophet g, Ashamah’s relationship with Allah’s Messenger g took on a new turn. By embracing Islam, he had effectively nullified his loyalty to the disbelievers and grasped the firm handhold of Islam, making it the only scale that would define his relationship with others. This became manifest when he cut off his ties to the Byzantine emperor, Heraclius, by cancelling the tribute he used to pay to him. Ibnul-Qayyim mentions that when the Prophet g sent ‘Amr Ibn al-‘As to the two kings of Oman with his letter calling them \n1  Here, ‘Amr was referring to the fact that the Prophet g and his companions declared that Jesus was not the son of Allah as was falsely claimed by Christians after the distortion of their religion.\n\fHe c also said, “Say, ‘If there had been with Him [other] gods, as they say, then they would have sought to get closer to the Owner of the Throne.’ He is glorified and greatly exalted above what they say. The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt Him. And there is not a thing except that it celebrates His praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting.  Indeed,  He  is  ever  Forbearing  and  Forgiving” (Al-Isra 42-44).\nHe c also said, “Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, ‘Come both of you, willingly or by compulsion.’ They said, ‘We have come willingly’” (Fussilat 11). He c also said, “Had there been within the heavens and earth gods besides Allah, they both would have been ruined. So exalted is Allah, Lord of the Throne, above what they describe” (Al-Anbiya 22).\nIn these various verses, Allah c teaches His slaves that the universe He created manifests recognition of His lordship and worship of Him alone by exalting His  praise  and  prostrating  to  Him  solely.  This  submission only to Him is behind the uniformity in the creation and what it contains of laws decreed by Him. If the creation had taken a god alongside its creator, obeying Allah and obeying a false god, loving Allah and loving a false god, and fearing Allah and fearing a false god, order would collapse within the universe.Allah c also created man and instilled in him the fitrah,  a  disposition  to  recognize  His  lordship  and worship  Him  alone.  Allah  c  said,  “So  direct  your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of Allah.  That  is  the  correct  religion,  but  most  of  the people do not know” (Ar-Rum 30).\nHe  c  made  this  fitrah  a  proof  against  mankind, saying, “And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam – from their loins – their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], ‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said, ‘Yes, we have testified’ – lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, ‘Indeed, we were of this unaware.’ Or [lest] you say, ‘It was only that our fathers associated [others in worship] with Allah before, and we were but descendants after them. Then would You destroy us for what the falsifiers have done?’” (Al-A’raf 172173).\nSigmund Freud, one of the engineers of Western decadence\nfilthiness,  between  decency  and  obscenity,  between mercy and cruelty, between justice and tyranny, between  truth  and  falsehood,  and  between  right  and wrong. In this regards, the Prophet g  said, “Every child is born upon the fitrah. His parents then make him a Jew or a Christian, just as you breed camels. Do you see any camels with their body parts mutilated until you yourselves mutilate them?” Abu Hurayrah  said, “Read if you wish, ‘…the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people; no change should there be in the creation of Allah…’” (Muslim). In this regards,  Allah  c  said,  “[The  polytheists]  supplicate none but a rebellious Satan, whom Allah has cursed for he had said, ‘I will surely take a prescribed portion from among Your servants. And I will mislead them, and I will arouse in them [sinful] desires, and I will command them so they will slit the ears of cattle, and I will command them so they will change the creation of Allah.’ And whoever takes Satan as an ally instead of Allah has certainly incurred a clear loss” (An-Nisa 117-119).\nThus, because the fitrah stands in the face of Satan as he attempts to deviate mankind from monotheism and purity to paganism and obscenity, he strives to obliterate this fitrah, as described by Allah c in the \nSo this fitrah is what causes man to distinguish between monotheism and polytheism.

        "@value": "\fA pagan church in Finland\nleft not knowing what to believe in, but I always had faith in the Creator and that He should be worshiped alone.\nI first heard about Islam when we were doing religious  studies  at  school.  We  covered  a  number  of different religions, including Islam. In the very first class, the teacher – who wasn’t even a Muslim – recited the shahadah in Arabic and then explained to us  that  this  was  the  Islamic  testimony  of  faith. We learned about the five pillars of Islam on a very basic level, but some things were portrayed in a manner that seemed nonsensical to me. For example, we were told that during the fasting month of Ramadan, Muslims don’t eat and drink all day but they stay up all night eating and partying. My next encounter with Islam was when I got married. My husband was brought up in a Muslim family but he wasn’t practicing at all. We had children together but got divorced a few years afterwards. At that point, I really wanted to learn about Islam, and because of the blessed events of September 11th,  I  would  always  see  Islam  mocked  in  the  media,  but  I  was  still  curious  and  wanted  to  find  out more about this religion. At the same time, I had a neighbor who had introduced me to Islam a few years earlier. So she let me borrow a copy of the Quran that was translated into my own language. The translation wasn’t so good, but she was good at explaining, so if I didn’t understand anything she would clarify it for me. What struck me most as I was reading the Quran were the verses about Hellfire and the punishment in the Hereafter.\nNot long afterwards, I knew that this religion really was the truth. I started learning to pray on my own because I thought I had to learn everything before  becoming  Muslim.  I  have  to  admit  though,  I \nwas scared and nervous because I didn’t understand a lot of things. I would think to myself, “How would my parents react if I were to become a Muslim? How would my colleagues react?” It felt like a big ordeal even though I knew in my heart that I had to do this. So when I was coming back from work one day and I saw my neighbor on the bus, I asked her, “Would you  like  to  teach  me  how  to  pray?”  She  replied  by asking, “Do you want to become a Muslim?” At that moment, I felt myself thinking, “Yes, I do.” So I said, “Yes,” and both her and her husband began crying. I pronounced the shahadah in their home and they began teaching me how to pray. It was a wonderful feeling.  After  continuously  searching  for  the  truth, finding it was just such a relief. I felt so much peace.I can’t say that things were easy after becoming a Muslim, but it did bring pleasure to my heart nonetheless. Things weren’t easy with my parents. At first, they didn’t react much, but one year later when I remarried, they began having a problem with it. When I started wearing hijab, they would make things difficult.  They  would  argue,  “Even  Muslims  that  were raised Muslim don’t wear it, so why do you?” They were not happy, and it was funny how their Christianity came out more than ever at that point. Before that, they wouldn’t speak about Christianity at all, but suddenly they were mentioning it more frequently, saying things like, “This is the religion of our forefathers.” All of this was to try to bring me back to their religion. I felt the same with my colleagues, who would ask me why I had made this decision. This was the case because I was the only Muslim they would see regularly.I lived in the capital, and although there were Muslims  there,  it  wasn’t  the  same  as  in  other  European countries;  the  Muslim  community  was  very  small. \n\f"

Indeed, association [with him] is great injustice.” And We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents. His mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years. Be grateful to Me and to your parents; to Me is the [final] destination. But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them  but  accompany  them  in  [this]  world  with appropriate kindness and follow the way of those who turn back to Me [in repentance]. Then to Me will be your return, and I will inform you about what you used to do} [Luqmān: 13-15].\nIn  these  verses,  good  treatment  of  one’s  parents follows  the  order  of  tawhīd  and  the  prohibition of treating them wickedly follows the prohibition of  shirk!  Allah’s  Messenger    said  three  times, “Shall  I  not  inform  you  of  the  greatest  of  major sins?”  The  Sahābah  replied,  “Yes,  O  Rasūlullāh.” He  said,  “Associating  partners  with  Allah  and wicked treatment of one’s parents” [Reported by alBukhārī and Muslim from Abū Bakrah]. He  also said, “The approval of the Lord is in the approval of one’s father and the anger of the Lord is in the anger  of  one’s  father”  [Reported  by  at-Tirmidhī from ‘Abdullāh Ibn ‘Amr].\nIt  was  also  reported  by  the  Tābi’ī  Wahb  Ibn Munabbih that Mūsā (‘alayhis-salām) asked his Lord (‘azza wa jall), “O Lord, with what do you order me?”  He  replied,  “That  you  do  not  associate  any partners with Me.” He asked, “And with what else?” He replied, “That you be dutiful to your mother.” He asked, “And with what else?” He replied, “That you  be  dutiful  to  your  mother.”  He  asked,  “And with what else?” He replied, “That you be dutiful to your mother” [Az-Zuhd – Imām Ahmad].\nSo how can the muwahhid ignore this obligation and  commit  the  major  sin  second  to  shirk  by treating  his  parents  wickedly?  And  how  can  the muwahhid not thank them, speak good words to them,  and  accompany  them  with  kindness?  This kind treatment is obligatory even if they might be sinful, and even if they order him with sin!\nBut  the  muwahhid  should  always  remember  that he is obliged not to obey his parents in what entails disobedience of Allah  as ordered by these āyāt and as the Prophet  said, “There is no obedience to anyone in disobedience of Allah. Obedience is only in good” [Reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim from ‘Alī]. He  also said, “Upon the Muslim is to listen and obey in regards to what he likes and dislikes,  except  if  he  is  ordered  with  sin.  If  he  is ordered  with  sin,  then  there  is  no  listening  nor obedience  [in  sin]”  [Reported  by  al-Bukhārī  and Muslim from Ibn ‘Umar].\nAmongst  the  major  sins  that  many  parents  order their  children  with  is  the  abandonment  of  the fard  ‘ayn  jihād  (jihād  which  is  obligatory  upon each  and  every  individual).  They  intentionally  or unintentionally  distort  the  meaning  of  various ahādīth on the obligation to obtain the permission of  one’s  Muslim  parents  before  performing  fard kifāyah jihād (jihād which is an obligation on the Ummah as a whole but not obligatory upon each and  every  individual).  These  ahādīth  should  be understood  in  light  of  other  evidences  including the  statement  of  Allah  ,  {Say,  “If  your  fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth  which  you  have  obtained,  commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and  His  Messenger  and  jihād  in  His  cause,  then wait until Allah executes His command. And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people”} [At-Tawbah: 24]. This āyah refers to a jihād that is not excused by obeying one’s parents. The scholars have unanimously explained that such jihād is the fard ‘ayn jihād.\nIbn  Qudāmah  said,  “If  jihād  becomes  obligatory upon  him  then  the  permission  of  his  parents  is not taken into consideration because the jihād has become fard ‘ayn and abandonment of it is a sin. There  is  no  obedience  to  anyone  in  disobedience of  Allah.  Similarly  is  the  case  of  hajj,  jamā’ah prayer, Friday prayer, travel for seeking obligatory knowledge. Al-Awzā’ī said, ‘There is no obedience to  the  parents  in  abandonment  of  obligations, Friday prayer, hajj, and jihād, because they are acts of worship that became obligatory upon him as an \ndabiq\n\fwho  fulfills  its  conditions  and  qualification mentioned  in  the  texts  of  the  Sharī’ah  and  the words of the scholars. The imām could be general to  all  the  Muslims,  and  he  is  called  the  general imām  or  the  khalīfah.  This  leader,  due  to  his status and the nature of his imāmah, has general influence; obedience to him is obligatory upon all the Muslims. This kind of imāmah is the default by which the obligation upon the whole Ummah to appoint a khalīfah is fulfilled and through him, the obligation is established. This is the intent of all  the  verses  and  ahādīth  that  order  and  guide towards  appointing  an  imām  and  khalīfah,  like the  hadith,  “Then  there  will  be  khilāfah  upon the  prophetic  methodology,”  and  the  hadīth narrated by Hudhayfah  “Stick to the jamā’ah of the Muslims and their imām,” and the hadith “If bay’ah is given to two khulafā’, then kill the second of the two,” and the other texts that are about  the  rules  regarding  the  general  imām  or khalīfah  who  deserves  this  description  having fulfilled the conditions and qualifications for it, as in the case of the khilāfah of the four Rightly Guided Khulafā’, as well as al-Hasan Ibn ‘Alī Ibn Abī Tālib, Mu’āwiyah Ibn Abī Sufyān, ‘Abdullāh Ibn az-Zubayr  and the khilafah of ‘Umar Ibn ‘Abdil-‘Azīz r, and others [from the Umawī and ‘Abbāsī khulafā’].\nAnd it might be the case that the imām or amīr is specific to some region or land, then he would be  a  territorial  leader  whose  authority  does  not exceed his territory, as the historians mentioned that  when  the  khalīfah  of  the  time  Mu’āwiyah Ibn Yazīd died in 64AH, the people of Damascus appointed ad-Dahhāk Ibn Qays as a leader to look after their affairs until the general imām is given bay’ah.  This  kind  of  leadership  is  not  allowed except in cases of necessity and when the general imāmah  is  dissolved.  This  is  done  to  fill  the political and shar’ī gap and to establish whatever is  possible  from  the  laws  of  the  Sharī’ah.  Many scholars  of  shar’ī  governance  have  mentioned such  appointments  in  such  situations,  like  alJuwaynī  in  his  prized  book  “Giyāth  al-Umam,” in which he said, “The purpose of imāmah is the betterment of the condition of the general public, planning the affairs, and protecting the frontiers.”\n“Therefore,  if  appointing  a  single  imām  whose orders  are  executed  is  possible,  then  there  is  no doubt  that  this  is  best  in  accordance  with  the requisites  of  governance.  If  this  is  not  possible, it is not correct to leave and neglect the people whom the imām’s supervision does not reach, as there  will  be  no  leader  to  gather  them  nor  any deterrent  to  prevent  them  from  evil.  So  they have to appoint ministers to whom they turn for leadership.  If  they  remain  leaderless,  they  will perish, and this is obvious and unpreventable.”\nIf not for the absence of the Khilāfah before, there would  not  have  been  a  shar’ī  justification  for those territorial leaderships or small groups to be formed and remain. Accordingly, it is obligatory to  appoint  a  single  imām  and  khalīfah  for  the Ummah who will govern the people in accordance with  Allah’s  religion  and  make  them  follow  the laws  of  the  Sharī’ah.  This  is  because  khilāfah  is similar to the case of water for wudū’, which is the  default,  and  those  territorial  leaderships  are like tayammum, which is an alternative allowed when necessary. And when the default is available, the  alternative  is  unaccepted.  Therefore,  when the  khalīfah  is  appointed,  all  other  pledges  of allegiance  and  leaderships  outside  of  it  become void. That is why al-Juwaynī said after his above statement, “If the obstacles are removed and the imām is able to supervise those people, the leader and his subjects must obey the imām and submit to  him  in  peace.  The  imām  should  accept  their excuses  and  govern  their  affairs.  If  he  decides to  approve  the  appointment  of  whom  they  had appointed, he can do so. And if he sees it best to change  him,  then  his  opinion  is  to  be  followed and they must return to his decision.”\nIf this is understood and the difference between these  realities  becomes  obvious,  the  answer  to the  question  posed  becomes  clear  through  the just  and  precise  description  of  the  imāmah  of Shaykh  Abū  Bakr  al-Husaynī  al-Baghdādī  and the leadership of Mullā ‘Umar, since one cannot decide  on  a  matter  until  the  whole  picture  is understood.  Accordingly, the  declarations, statements,  conducts,  and  nature  of  Mullā ‘Umar’s leadership shows without a doubt that it \ndabiq\n\f"

The point is, people know that it’s foolish, but they keep repeating it regardless because they’re afraid of the consequences of deviating from the script.\nThere  are  exceptions  among  the  disbelievers,  no doubt, people who will unabashedly declare that jihad and the laws of the Shari’ah – as well as everything else deemed taboo by the Islam-is-a-peaceful-religion crowd – are in fact completely Islamic, but they tend to be people with far less credibility who are painted as a social fringe, so their voices are dismissed and a large segment of the ignorant masses continues believing the false narrative. As such, it becomes important for us to clarify to the West in unequivocal terms – yet again – why we hate you and why we fight you.\n1.  We hate you, first and foremost, because you are  disbelievers;  you  reject  the  oneness  of  Allah  – whether  you  realize  it  or  not  –  by  making  partners for  Him  in  worship,  you  blaspheme  against  Him, claiming that He has a son, you fabricate lies against His prophets and messengers, and you indulge in all manner of devilish practices. It is for this reason that we were commanded to openly declare our hatred for you and our enmity towards you. “There has already been for you an excellent example in Abraham and \nthose with him, when they said to their people, ‘Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than Allah. We have rejected you, and there has arisen, between us and you, enmity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone’” (Al-Mumtahanah 4). Furthermore, just as your disbelief  is  the  primary  reason  we  hate  you,  your  disbelief is the primary reason we fight you, as we have been commanded to fight the disbelievers until they submit to the authority of Islam, either by becoming Muslims, or by paying jizyah – for those afforded this option – and living in humiliation under the rule of the Muslims. Thus, even if you were to stop fighting us, your best-case scenario in a state of war would be that we would suspend our attacks against you – if we deemed it necessary – in order to focus on the closer and more immediate threats, before eventually resuming our campaigns against you. Apart from the option of a temporary truce, this is the only likely scenario that would bring you fleeting respite from our attacks. So in the end, you cannot bring an indefinite halt to our war against you. At most, you could only delay it temporarily. “And fight them until there is no fitnah [paganism] and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah” (Al-Baqarah 193).\n2.  We hate you because your secular, liberal societies permit the very things that Allah has prohibited while banning many of the things He has permitted,  a  matter  that  doesn’t  concern  you  because  you \n\f\f"

Alloush  and  his  staff  ‘are  getting much  more  savvy,’  he  said,  based  on  Twitter conversations  he’s  had  with  the  commander’s spokesman.”\n“‘Everybody is aware now that the regime is very weak  and  on  the  way  to  collapse,’  said  Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat who lives in Washington. ‘And every major player wants to be acceptable  to  the  West  and  to  the  international community.’”\n“‘Zahran  wants  to  be  on  the  winning  side,’  he said.”\n“Landis said Alloush would be there. ‘He’s going to be a winner,’ he said. Alloush’s Army of Islam and other  Islamist  groups,  the  ‘hard-bitten  patriotic types … will win in the end,’ he said.”\n“Presenting a new face may be one reason Alloush traveled  to  Istanbul,  where  he  was  interviewed, and  was  heading  next  to  Jordan  to  confer  with rebel commanders who operate in southern Syria, as well as their international backers. His fighters need weapons.”\n“In his interview with McClatchy, he adhered to the moderate line: ‘If we succeed in toppling the regime,  we  will  leave  it  to  the  Syrian  people  to choose the form of state they want,’ he said. ‘As for coexistence with minorities, this has been the situation in Syria for hundreds of years. We are not seeking to impose our power on minorities or to practice oppression against them. On the contrary, we have criticized the regime and fought it because it was practicing sectarian discrimination against the majority during the eras it ruled Syria.’”\n“Another  aide  said  that  Alloush,  to  improve  his image, was ready to dispense with the black and white Islamic flag and adopt the Syrian flag used by other rebel forces.”\n“[Zahran]  said  the  Army  of  Islam  had  been  in direct touch with Daniel Rubinstein, the Obama \nadministration’s  special  envoy assertion the State Department confirmed.”\nfor  Syria,  an \nThat  ends  the  words  of  Alloush’s  allies.  To summarize:  He  believes  in  self-determination,  a cornerstone of democracy. He believes in freedom of religion and religious coexistence, a cornerstone of  secularist  nationalism.  And  he  compromises religious fundamentals, meets with Jewish leaders part  of  the  crusade  against  Islam,  and  raises banners  of  secularist  jāhiliyyah  for  the  sake  of obtaining aid. And yet, Alloush has been one of the top allies of “al-Qā’idah” in Syria (the Jawlānī front) – openly having praised both Jawlānī and al-Harārī  (a  major  leader  of  the  Jawlānī  front) in  interviews  released  officially  by  his  “Army  of Islam.” He himself has been praised by al-Harārī via internet tweets.\nThe Jewish envoy Daniel Rubinstein,ally of Zahran Alloush\nAgain, the deviance of Alloush has been something known  to  these  jihād  claimants  long  before  this recent  interview  and  even  before  the  official expansion of the Islamic State to Shām, and yet the  Jawlānī  front  supported  the  “Islamic  Front” that  Alloush  led  in  the  war  against  the  Islamic State.1\nThis interview was followed by a declaration by the allies of the Jawlānī front condemning the Jawlānī front’s killing of more than twenty apostate Druze 1 A former member of Jawlānī’s shūrā council has also informed Dābiq that when Jawlānī was ordered by Dhawāhirī to join the apostate “Islamic” Front, he refused to do so, saying that Dhawāhirī was unaware of the situation on the ground. When Jawlānī was pressured by the former Ahrār ash-Shām leadership to follow Dhawāhirī’s order, he stipulated that Zahran Alloush be removed from the “Islamic” Front leadership, and yet he cooperated on numerous frontlines with the “Islamic” Front led by Alloush against the Islamic State since the beginning of the Sahwah?!\ndabiq\n\f{And  [mention],  when  Luqmān  said  to  his  son while he was instructing him, “O my son, do not associate [anything] with Allah. Indeed, association [with him] is great injustice.” And We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents. His mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years. Be grateful to Me and to your parents; to Me is the [final] destination. But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them  but  accompany  them  in  [this]  world  with appropriate kindness and follow the way of those who turn back to Me [in repentance]. Then to Me will be your return, and I will inform you about what you used to do} [Luqmān: 13-15].\nIn  these  verses,  good  treatment  of  one’s  parents follows  the  order  of  tawhīd  and  the  prohibition of treating them wickedly follows the prohibition of  shirk!  Allah’s  Messenger    said  three  times, “Shall  I  not  inform  you  of  the  greatest  of  major sins?”  The  Sahābah  replied,  “Yes,  O  Rasūlullāh.” He  said,  “Associating  partners  with  Allah  and wicked treatment of one’s parents” [Reported by alBukhārī and Muslim from Abū Bakrah]. He  also said, “The approval of the Lord is in the approval of one’s father and the anger of the Lord is in the anger  of  one’s  father”  [Reported  by  at-Tirmidhī from ‘Abdullāh Ibn ‘Amr].\nIt  was  also  reported  by  the  Tābi’ī  Wahb  Ibn Munabbih that Mūsā (‘alayhis-salām) asked his Lord (‘azza wa jall), “O Lord, with what do you order me?”  He  replied,  “That  you  do  not  associate  any partners with Me.” He asked, “And with what else?” He replied, “That you be dutiful to your mother.” He asked, “And with what else?” He replied, “That you  be  dutiful  to  your  mother.”  He  asked,  “And with what else?” He replied, “That you be dutiful to your mother” [Az-Zuhd – Imām Ahmad].\nSo how can the muwahhid ignore this obligation and  commit  the  major  sin  second  to  shirk  by treating  his  parents  wickedly?  And  how  can  the muwahhid not thank them, speak good words to them,  and  accompany  them  with  kindness?  This kind treatment is obligatory even if they might be sinful, and even if they order him with sin!\nBut  the  muwahhid  should  always  remember  that he is obliged not to obey his parents in what entails disobedience of Allah  as ordered by these āyāt and as the Prophet  said, “There is no obedience to anyone in disobedience of Allah. Obedience is only in good” [Reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim from ‘Alī]. He  also said, “Upon the Muslim is to listen and obey in regards to what he likes and dislikes,  except  if  he  is  ordered  with  sin.  If  he  is ordered  with  sin,  then  there  is  no  listening  nor obedience  [in  sin]”  [Reported  by  al-Bukhārī  and Muslim from Ibn ‘Umar].\nAmongst  the  major  sins  that  many  parents  order their  children  with  is  the  abandonment  of  the fard  ‘ayn  jihād  (jihād  which  is  obligatory  upon each  and  every  individual).  They  intentionally  or unintentionally  distort  the  meaning  of  various ahādīth on the obligation to obtain the permission of  one’s  Muslim  parents  before  performing  fard kifāyah jihād (jihād which is an obligation on the Ummah as a whole but not obligatory upon each and  every  individual).  These  ahādīth  should  be understood  in  light  of  other  evidences  including the  statement  of  Allah  ,  {Say,  “If  your  fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth  which  you  have  obtained,  commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and  His  Messenger  and  jihād  in  His  cause,  then wait until Allah executes His command. And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people”} [At-Tawbah: 24]. This āyah refers to a jihād that is not excused by obeying one’s parents. The scholars have unanimously explained that such jihād is the fard ‘ayn jihād.\nIbn  Qudāmah  said,  “If  jihād  becomes  obligatory upon  him  then  the  permission  of  his  parents  is not taken into consideration because the jihād has become fard ‘ayn and abandonment of it is a sin. There  is  no  obedience  to  anyone  in  disobedience of  Allah.  Similarly  is  the  case  of  hajj,  jamā’ah prayer, Friday prayer, travel for seeking obligatory knowledge. Al-Awzā’ī said, ‘There is no obedience to  the  parents  in  abandonment  of  obligations, Friday prayer, hajj, and jihād, because they are acts of worship that became obligatory upon him as an \ndabiq\n\f"

Back  then,  it  was  all  about crushing  the  unruly  “terrorists”  in  Iraq  and Afghanistan with “shock and awe” and the might of  the  American  war  machine.  But  today  the men in charge are being forced to concede that maybe, just perhaps, they were a little too quick off the mark to dismiss the Islamic State as merely “a terrorist organization, pure and simple.” And that’s just three months into their campaign.\nI  am  certainly  no  expert  on  such  matters  and my  views  are  those  of  a  layman,  but  generally one doesn’t expect a mere “organization” to lay siege  to  cities  or  have  their  own  police  force. You certainly don’t expect a mere “organization” to  have  tanks  and  artillery  pieces,  an  army  of soldiers tens of thousands strong, and their own spy drones. And one certainly doesn’t expect a mere “organization” to have a mint with plans to \nPARADIGM SHIFT\nproduce their own currency, primary schools for the young, and a functioning court system.\nThese, surely, are all hallmarks of (whisper it if you dare) a country.\nAh,  the  C-word.  It’s  being  used  sporadically  by the media, slowly at first but its use is gathering pace. Could the Islamic State, the Caliphate that was only announced in June, really be a country?\n“ISIS will have taken more towns, more territory, consolidated  more  gains  and  really  become, unfortunately, the kind of country we don’t want to  see  over  there,”  declared  retired  Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cowan on Fox News in October 2014.\nAs uncomfortable as it may be for many in the West, there’s little reason why the State shouldn’t be considered a country. Countries can be born in days, in hours during a coup, or in minutes at the signing of a paper, they have been for centuries. So there’s no reason this one shouldn’t have been born the way it was. And if it’s not the Islamic State’s country, then just whose is it?\nCertainly, it no longer belongs to Bashar al-Asad, holed up in Damascus as his soldiers recuperate after  four  years  of  massacring  the  Muslims  of Syria.  There  was  never  any  legitimacy  to  his tyrannical rule and what control he had has long passed and can never return.\nDoes  it  then  belong  to  the  newly  instated  and incompetent  puppet  Iraqi  government,  tucked away in Baghdad while its army licks its wounds from the murderous thrashing it received from the mujāhidīn back in the summer? Clearly not. And it definitely doesn’t belong to the Free Syrian Army, who had years to do something decisive or cohesive but chose instead to smoke Gauloises cigarettes, drink tea, and complain that nothing could be done without NATO jets flying overhead. Well they are now, and they’ve still achieved zero.\nNo indeed. If anyone has an actual claim to the lands stretching across Iraq and Syria (or any of \ndabiq\n\f"

However, the ultimate message of the Prophet Muhammad g, the revelation he was dispatched with – the Quran and the Sunnah – and the message of all past prophets from Adam to Muhammad  has been the same throughout history: There is no ilah but Allah. The ilah linguistically being “what deserves worship,” i.e. nothing and  no  one  deserves  worship  except  Allah.  Allah  is the proper name of the Lord and the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth. It is derived from the same word ilah and is similar in root to the name of the Creator as found in all Semitic languages, including the Hebrew spoken by the Prophets of the Children of Israel. In the Hebrew tongue, they would supplicate the Lord saying “Elohim,” which corresponds in Arabic  to  “Allahumm;”  the  suffix  “him”  of  Hebrew and “humm” of Arabic – sometimes referred to as the “majestic plural” – affixed to “Eloh” and “Allah” is to emphasize His reverence and the supplicant’s humility. He is to be worshiped alone as He alone is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, He alone is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and He alone has the  loftiest  attributes,  including  knowledge,  power, justice,  mercy,  wisdom,  beauty,  honor,  majesty,  etc. If some of His creation manifests praiseworthy traits, then this is only due to His design and His guidance; the traits of the creation can never be on par with His perfect  attributes.  This  is  why  He  deserves  worship alone and why no person or object can ever deserve worship.\nAs  for  believing  that  there  are  other  “gods”  who partook in the creation of the universe or who have share in its lordship, then this was a creed so deviant \nto submit to Allah sincerely (i.e. to Him alone).\nand  contrary  to  the  fitrah  that  not  even  the  pre-Islamic  pagan  Arabs  believed  in  such.  Instead,  their paganism was in supplicating idols representing the righteous; they would do so seeking the intercession of the righteous on their behalf before Allah c. However, at times of severe calamity, they would abandon their idols and supplicate Allah alone. Allah c said, “And when they board a ship, they supplicate Allah, being sincere to Him in religion. But when He delivers them to the land, they immediately give shares of worship to other than Him” (Al-‘Ankabut 65). Accordingly, this part of the fitrah – recognition of Allah’s lordship alone – was emphasized by all the prophets in their mission to bring back their pagan peoples to the abandoned part of the fitrah – worship of Allah alone. Allah c said, “And if you asked them, ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’ they would surely say, ‘Allah.’ Say, ‘Then have you considered what you supplicate besides Allah? If Allah intended me harm, are they removers of His harm; or if He intended me mercy, are they withholders of His mercy?’ Say, ‘Sufficient for me is Allah; in Him the trusting put their trust’” (Az-Zumar 38). He c also said, “Say, ‘Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges [every] matter?’ They will say, ‘Allah.’ So say, ‘Then will you not fear Him?’” (Yunus 31), meaning, will you not fear Him by worshiping Him alone and obeying Him only?\nAllah c also said, “And We sent not before you any messenger except that We revealed to him that, ‘There is no god except Me, so worship Me’” (Al-Anbiya 25). Thus, the message of all the prophets emphasizes worship and obedience of Allah only and no one  else.  There  is  no  ilah  but  Allah,  meaning  none \n\fcreatures and facilitated for them a means of communication not fathomable by either of them!\nIt was a moment of reflection like no other, a blessing from Allah c. After my shift was over, I rushed to speak about it with another murabit, Abul-Muthanna as-Sumali2  .  For  several  months  together,  we  had both been in the ranks of the Islamic State, then operating in the Levant under the name “Jabhat an-Nusrah.” I told him about the experience with the cat and he smiled, appreciating Allah’s signs in His creation. \n2  Abul-Muthanna  as-Sumali  (Ali  Dirie)  was  a  man  of  great character and worship. After being imprisoned by the Crusaders for seven years, he was able to flee Canada despite being banned from  travel.  He  planned,  strove,  and  relied upon Allah alone, until he arrived in the Levant. When I first met him, he would regularly read from the same mushaf that had accompanied him in his Canadian prison cell. Upon the official expansion of the Islamic State to the Levant, he rushed to revive the Muslim Jama’ah through his bay’ah. He was not affected by the doubts of the jihad claimants and remained firm upon his covenant. Several weeks later, he had a dream in which the Hur (the maidens of Paradise) gave him glad tidings of martyrdom on a specific date (one which I have forgotten). A week before his martyrdom, several of our friends decided to go shopping for new military attire. He told them he wouldn’t be going with them, because he was expecting martyrdom soon, and narrated to them his dream. When that day arrived, it happened that all Islamic State soldiers were placed on alert due to sudden advances of the Nusayri army and their Rafidi allies on the frontlines near Kafar Hamrah (in the  northern  Aleppo  countryside).  Abul-Muthanna  rushed  to battle and advanced in the direction of the enemy, fighting, until he was severely wounded, bleeding until he surrendered his soul to his Lord. Due to the intensity of enemy fire, it was not possible to extract his body from the forward position he had reached. May Allah accept him and add the blessing of caliphate we enjoy today to the scroll of his good deeds and that of all other martyrs.\nThe conversation led us to reflect more upon others of Allah’s signs, even expressing our good assumptions on the revival of the caliphate with the continuation of jihad in the Levant, by Allah’s permission. Abul-Muthanna later went on his ribat shift, observing the same cat and looking out for any potential Nusayri soldiers.I  don’t  remember  now  if  it  was  then  or  sometime shortly before, when I had sat at our base near Aleppo and penned a list of different signs in Allah’s creation to contemplate while on ribat. I later asked Abul-Muthanna if he’d like me to share the list with him. He was very encouraging. So I read to him different  items  on  it  and  he  would  comment  on  how they were undoubtedly from Allah’s many signs manifesting His wisdom, knowledge, greatness, power, and mercy, as well as His constant support for Islam and the Muslims. It was an invigorating conversation of faith, one which was difficult to hold in the West, as the  Muslim  would  find  himself  a  stranger  amongst the herds who had been westernized by the Murtadd Brotherhood.\nHere, I’ll mention briefly some of the signs we had discussed. But before doing so, let me present an example for the atheists and agnostics of the West who will probably read these words, those odd disbelievers who  arrogantly  deny  Allah  and  haughtily  resist  the testimony  of  their  very  own  fitrah  (natural  human disposition), which Allah instilled in them. Allah c said, “And it is He who begins creation; then He repeats it, and that would be easier for Him. His is the sublime example in the heavens and earth. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise” (Ar-Rum 27-28). In these verses, Allah c teaches us what the “sublime ex-\n\f"

In India, they are the allies of the nationalist Kashmir factions whose advances and withdrawals are only by the order of the apostate Pakistani army. In North Africa, they are the allies of the Libyan factions who partook in the religion of democracy in the name of “Islam.”\nAnd in Yemen, one of the top allies of al-Qā’idah – after the ‘Abd Rabbuh battalions, the “Islāh” parliamentarians, and the pro-Saudi “Salafiyyah” of Dammaj and Ma’rib – is the “Hadhrami Domestic Council.” According to the introduction found on the council’s official website, “The Hadhrami Domestic Council in the city of al-Mukallā – the capital of Hadramawt – was formed and then announced on Monday, 13 April 2015, to be an authority for administering \n55\nTHE ALLIES OF AL-QĀ‘IDAH IN YEMEN\nKhālid Bāturfī - The new Harārī of Yemen\nthe affairs of the Hadramawt capital city of al-Mukallā after  being  granted  control  over  it  by  those  who  collapsed it – Ansār ash-Sharī’ah, ‘The Sons of Hadramawt’1 – on 2 April 2015.2 The Hadhrami Domestic Council was formed by a fine selection of the sincere men of Hadramawt including religious scholars, prominent figures, tribal figures, social  figures,  businessmen,  academics,  engineers,  media professionals, and officers in the army and security forces. They shouldered their historical responsibility at a crucial moment for the sake of Hadramawt. They did not abandon it to an unknown future. They kept it from being a target of foreign forces, lack of authority and security, theft, destruction, and chaos. This is from the most important goals for which the Hadhrami Domestic Council was formed, in addition to shouldering the responsibility of administering the affairs of the city with the aid of the citizens and by preserving its security and stability and securing the continued delivery of necessary services including water, food supplies, electricity, medical care, waste management, education, and other services. The council also has high hopes in its citizens contributing towards achieving these noble goals and normalizing public life, each person in his realm of work and specialization, and that they will unite their ranks for the \n1 Editor’s Note: “The Sons of Hadramawt” is the new name used by the Yemeni branch of al-Qā’idah as it dodges its former name “Ansār ashSharī’ah.”2 Editor’s Note: The coordinated handover of al-Mukallā by al-Qā’idah to this council was mentioned in Dābiq, issue 10, pages 67-68.\n\f[This article was first published in “Sawtul-Jihād,” former magazine of al-Qā’idah in the Arabian Peninsula (before the partisan Yemeni branch). The author of the piece r did not suffice with seeking knowledge and training, but instead led the battle against Āl Salūl until he achieved shahādah for Allah’s sake.

And it is known that the authority of these rulers is invalid, and that it is obligatory to oppose them and wage war against them. But what is meant by listening and obeying here is in reference to those whom Allah has given authority over the affairs of jihād [and now, the Khilāfah]. This is a very important and very serious matter, which the Wise legislator has urged. And His Messenger g has made disobedience of one’s leader similar to disobedience of the Prophet g. Listening and obeying is from unity, cooperation, and strength,  in  contrast  with  quarrelling,  disunity,  and  disagreement.\nQuarrelling  and  disagreement  in  jihād  is  considered  a means of failure and defeat. {And do not dispute and [thus] lose courage and [then] your strength would depart; and be patient. Indeed, Allah is with the patient} [Al-Anfāl: 46].\nHe who studies history and Sīrah sees that disobeying the \n99\nADVICE TO THE MUJĀHIDĪN: LISTEN AND OBEY\n\f"

In such a scenario, the blessed ones are often those who are able to survive with their īmān intact and a mountain of sins to answer for on the Day of Judgment. But even in the case of those who eventually make the decision to leave such lands and perform hijrah to dārul-Islām after Allah guides them and opens their eyes to the dangerous situation they are in, it’s often too late for their family. For many, the decision to save themselves comes after they’ve already lost their children, some to drugs and promiscuity, and others to kufr, shirk, and even atheism. And it all begins in the schools.\nMany of those who send their children to the schools of the kuffār are “uneducated”1 and thereby unable to teach their children themselves, so they rely on others to teach them. Many others are in financial need, so they don’t have the money to hire a Muslim tutor that can teach  their  children  without  incorporating  un-Islamic \n1 This is a term used to refer exclusively to secular “education.” Many people have been duped into believing that a secular “education” is a “necessity,” so much so that they consider it a child’s essential “right” to waste dozens of years in school to obtain a piece of paper that may ultimately have nothing to do with the profession he later works in! In addition to this, one could memorize the Qur’ān and study the Sunnah with a scholar, but if he – despite all that – hadn’t completed his secular “education,” he would be labeled “uneducated”!\nShortly before making hijrah to Shām a few years ago from the crusader nation in which I’d been raised, my mother mentioned to me that she had recently spoken to a family friend from back home who asked her about our condition and the condition of other families from the same country who were living in the West. She told me that she claimed we were all doing well – and in the Dunyā sense we were in fact doing fairly well – when in reality, as my mother said, “Every family that comes here suffers one calamity or another with respect to their children.” What she was referring to, as she went on to clarify, were the countless Muslim youth in the West who get themselves tangled into drugs, alcohol, gangs, promiscuity, and other vices and social illnesses over which any decent Muslim family would weep for its children.\nAnd  yet  as  terrible  as  these  vices  may  be,  the  fact  remains that many still downplay the severity of kufr in comparison with other sins. This is not to water down the issue of committing sins but for the sake of perspective I need to make it clear that this is addressed to Muslims who are risking their entire Hereafter by continuing to live under the authority of the crusaders waging war against Islam or in lands ruled by \n3333\nO YOU WHO HAVE BELIEVED, PROTECT YOURSELVES AND YOUR FAMILIES FROM FIRE\n\f3737\nTHE REVIVAL OF JIHĀD IN BENGAL\n\f"

The  brother  Tāriq  Ibn  at-Tāhir  alHarzī  –  otherwise  known  as  Abū ‘Umar  at-Tunusī  –  was  killed  in Wilāyat al-Barakah, completing a life of  jihād  and  many  years  of  service working  to  help  build  the  Islamic State  and  reestablish  the  Khilāfah. He had, throughout his jihād in both Irāq and Shām, a number of different titles and held a number of different positions.\nA veteran of many years in the Islamic State, the brother first made hijrah to Iraq in 2003. He became acquainted with some of the legends of the Iraqi jihād such as Abū Mus’ab az-Zarqāwī and  Abū  Hamzah  al-Muhājir  (may Allah accept them both). The former, as  the  jihād  progressed,  made  a request for the brother to come to alFallūjah. It was a call to which Abū ‘Umar  responded,  living  great  days in the city that stood defiantly in the \nface  of  the  American  transgression on  the  lands  of  the  Muslims. Time passed,  many  kuffār  were  sent  to Jahannam,  and  the  brother  was  hit by  a  crusader  airstrike  in  which  all those who were with him were killed. This time Allah  saved him and he emerged  relatively  unharmed.  He was  later  hit  by  a  second  airstrike, resulting in his leg being severed (he later  became  well  known  for  this physical attribute).\nThe  brother  was  imprisoned  twice in Iraq, the first time escaping with a fake document under the pretense that he was Iraqi and not a muhājir. The  Americans  were  enraged  upon discovering  the  true  identity  of  the man who had slipped through their inept  fingers.  The  second  time  was in 2008 after he was sentenced to 15 years. He and a group of his mujāhid brothers escaped during an operation by  the  Islamic  State  to  liberate  the Tājī  prison.  He  was  subsequently sent  to  land  of  Shām  and  was made  responsible  for  receiving  the istishhādiyyīn  and  appointed  the \namīr of the Atmah gateway. He was a brave leader during the war against the sahwah treachery and was famous for his saying, “Allah will never grant them  victory  over  us.  We  defeated them in Iraq, and we will also defeat them  in  Shām,  by  Allah’s  bounty alone.”\nAbū ‘Umar was known for practicing zuhd with respect to his clothes and his food, earning the love and respect of  many  after  reaching  the  blessed land  of  Shām.  After  relocating, he  settled  in  Wilāyat  al-Barakah, eventually  being  appointed  as  the amīr  of  the  wilāyah’s  artillery.  This beloved  brother  and  veteran  was killed  24  hours  after  his  brother Abuz-Zubayr ‘Alī al-Harzī was killed in  Mosul.  The  two  brothers,  both avid  boxers,  together  terrorized  the kuffār, leaving this world in the same way as each other.\nHe  was  a  thorn  in  the  sides  of  the disbelieving  crusaders  and  their  slaves from  amongst  the  apostates.  We  ask Allah to accept him in al-Firdaws al-A’lā.\ndabiq\n\fguidance to the wives of the Sahwah soldiers, in order for me {to be absolved before your Lord and perhaps they may fear Him} [Al-A’rāf: 164].\nWe write this for the wives of the secular-oriented Sahwāt  who  have  stated  explicitly  or  implicitly their intent to rule with democracy, or according to what the people desire, or with division of powers. Allah  said, {And He shares not His legislation with anyone} [Al-Kahf: 26].\nWe also write this for the wives of the Sahwāt who superficially claim Islam and stuck out their necks for their secular-oriented brothers and supported them with their lives and with everything precious to them against the muwahiddīn. \nAllah    says,  {And  whoever  is  an  ally  to  them among  you  –  then  indeed,  he  is  [one]  of  them} [Al-Mā’idah: 51].\nFrom amongst the most beautiful stories found in the  books  of  history  is  the  story  of  Zaynab,  the daughter  of  the  Prophet  ,  and  her  husband Abul-‘Ās Ibn ar-Rabī’, who were united by love and marriage, and split apart by kufr and shirk. Abul‘Ās married Zaynab, who was the daughter of his maternal aunt Khadījah . When the revelation descended upon the Prophet , Khadījah and her daughters believed in him and followed his religion, and this included Zaynab. Her husband Abul-‘Ās, however,  rejected  Islam  and  remained  upon  his shirk.  At  that  time,  Islam  had  divided  between every married couple where one of them followed other than Islam. Abul-‘Ās, however, held his wife with him in Makkah. Then, Allah  willed that he would fall prisoner to the Muslims in the battle of  Badr.  The  people  of  Makkah  sent  ransoms  to the Prophet . Here, the Mother of the Believers ‘Ā’ishah Bint as-Siddīq  will continue the story for us. She said, “When the people of Makkah sent ransoms for their imprisoned relatives, Zaynab the daughter of Allah’s Messenger  sent some wealth as a ransom for Abul-‘Ās Ibn ar-Rabī’. She sent a necklace which Khadījah had her wear when she sent  her  to  Abul-‘Ās  to  move  in  with  him  after marriage.” ‘Ā’ishah said, “When Allah’s Messenger  saw it, he felt much pity for her. He said, ‘If \nyou would like to free her prisoner and return her wealth to her then do so.’ They said, ‘Yes, O Allah’s Messenger.’ So they freed him and returned to her what  was  hers”  [Reported  by  Imām  Ahmad  and Abū Dāwūd].\nAnd  it’s  reported  that  the  Prophet    stipulated on  him  that  he  return  Zaynab  when  he  reaches Makkah because she was no longer lawful for him as long as he remained a mushrik. Abul-‘Ās did so, and  Zaynab    left  for  al-Madīnah,  the  land  of Islam. Zaynab left Makkah out of love for Allah and in submission to His command, and did not put her husband and his companionship above the decree of Allah and His Messenger , because {it is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when  Allah  and  His  Messenger  have  decided  a matter,  that  they  should  have  any  choice  about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger  has  certainly  strayed  into  clear  error} [Al-Ahzāb: 36].\nHowever, Allah wished to open Abul-‘Ās’s heart to the truth many long years after his wife’s hijrah, so he came to the Prophet  declaring his Islam, and so the Prophet returned Zaynab to him.\nThen  there’s  Umm  Sulaym  Bint  Milhān  likewise refusing  to  marry  a  kāfir  and  stipulating  that  he embraces Islam as her mahr (dowry). It was reported on the authority of Anas  who said, “Abū Talhah proposed to Umm Sulaym, so she said, ‘By Allah, one  such  as  yourself  cannot  be  rejected,  O  Abū Talhah, but you are a kāfir man and I am a Muslim woman, and it is not permissible for me to marry you. So if you embrace Islam, then that will be my mahr, and I will not ask from you other than that.’ So  he  embraced  Islam  and  that  was  her  mahr” [Reported by an-Nasā’ī and Ibn Hibbān].\nSo then that is Islam. It declares it loudly, clearly, and  explicitly:  {They  are  not  lawful  [wives]  for them,  nor  are  they  lawful  [husbands]  for  them} [Al-Mumtahanah: 10]. So there is no Islam with kufr,  no  tawhid  with  shirk,  and  no  īmān  with nifāq. And this small Muslim home is the core of the Ummah, and the parable of these two spouses and  their  children  is  like  that  of  a  plant  that \ndabiq\n\f"

We announce that this sectarian mission aims at dividing the Ummah, weakening its forces, taking its riches, and occupying the Muslims’ sanctuaries in  Makkah  al-Mukarramah  and  al-Madīnah  alMunawwarah. This is a matter that we will never allow to happen, whatever the circumstances may be. Thus we have prepared two thousand fighters from the heroes of Faylaq ash-Shām to be under the command of the Servant of the Noble Haramayn, King  Salmān  Ibn  ‘Abdil-Azīz  Āl  Sa’ūd,  so  that they defend the lands of the Noble Haramayn and defeat the enemies of the Ummah from amongst the tails and arms of Iran in the brotherly land of Yemen. We do this to support the truth and out of loyalty to the one who stood by and supported the struggle of the Syrian people. And we indeed stand up  in  defense  of  the  Muslims’  holy  sanctuaries through our humble contribution of two thousand fighters  from  the  best  of  the  sons  of  Shām.  We appeal to the countries from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to rush to stand in the face  of  this  Safawī  plan  and  to  strive  to  stop  all those who allowed themselves to transgress against our sanctities and holy sanctuaries. Indeed Iran’s insolence and that of its tails will not be deterred except  with  resolve2,  and  it  will  not  be  stopped except by the language of resolve, and this is what we  are  now  doing  with  all  strength  and  resolve, asking Allah (ta’ālā) for victory and steadfastness.”\n“{And  Our  word  has  already  preceded  for  Our servants,  the  messengers,  [That]  indeed,  they would be those given victory And [that] indeed, Our  soldiers  will  be  those  who  overcome}  [AsSāffāt: 171-173].”\n“And our last call is that all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the creation.”\n“Faylaq ash-Shām”“25 Rajab 1436 / 14 May 2015”This ends their statement of deviance.\n2 Editor’s Note: This and all subsequent usage of the word is in reference to the “Storm of Resolve” announced by Āl Salūl.\nIt  is  important  to  note  that  when  the  apostates (the Tawāghīt and the Rāfidah) fight each other, it is not permissible for the Muslim to support one party  of  apostates  against  the  other  by  fighting under  the  leadership  of  one  party  or  fighting in  its  defense.  Allah  (ta’ālā)  said,  {Those  who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve  fight  in  the  cause  of  tāghūt.  So  fight against  the  allies  of  Shaytān}  [An-Nisā’:  76]. So  it  is  not  permissible  for  the  Muslim  to  fight against Āl Salūl under the leadership of the Rāfidī Houthis nor is it permissible to fight against the Rāfidī Houthis under the leadership of Āl Salūl. If he does fight under the leadership of the tāghūt in defense of his kufrī regime, he apostatizes from Islam.  Therefore,  the  Muslim  should  know  that the obligation upon him when the apostates wage war  against  each  other  is  to  declare  his  barā’ah from  both  apostate  parties  and  –  if  he  is  able  – to perform jihād against both of them for Allah’s sake.\nAs  to  the  cause  behind  this  deviant  declaration being  released,  then  it  is  the  addiction  of  these factions  to  tāghūt  aid.  Initially,  the  tawāghīt trap  them  with  supposedly  “innocent”  and “unconditional”  aid  before  they  slide  down  a slippery slope of concessions ending with blatant apostasy.\nAnd  so,  will  the  jihād  claimants  of  the  Jawlānī front  wage  “jihād”  against  their  allies,  the shameless slaves of Āl Salūl? Or are there endless excuses  prepared  for  each  blatant  statement  of apostasy made by them? Āl Salūl have now openly occupied  parts  of  Idlib,  Halab,  and  Shām  in general through this “legion,” Zahrān ‘Allūsh, and their  brothers  from  the  “Islamic”  Front.  Worst yet, the factions of “Jaysh al-Fath” are referred to as  “Ahlus-Sunnah”  and  the  “truthful  mujāhidīn” by al-Jawlānī in his most recent speech!\nMay  Allah  expose  the  hypocritical  and  apostate allies of “al-Qā’idah” in Shām3. \n3 It is hizbiyyah and irjā’ that allowed the Syrian “al-Qā’idah” to support these apostate factions against the muhājirīn and ansār. See “The Hizbiyyīn and the Grayzone” on pages 62-66 of issue #7 and “The Irjā’ of the Jihād Claimants” on pages 52-56 of issue #8 to read about the deviance of these jihād claimants and how it led them upon this dark path.\ndabiq\n\fal-Basrī \nsaid \n(rahimahullāh) \nAl-Hasan in explanation of the āyah, “He ordered them to be patient upon their religion, and not to abandon it because of hardship, luxury, leisure, or adversity. He ordered them to outlast the kuffār in patience and to perform ribāt against the mushrikīn” [Tafsīr at-Tabarī].\nZayd Ibn Aslam (rahimahullāh) said, “Be patient upon jihād, outlast your enemy in patience, and perform  ribāt  against  your  enemy”  [Tafsīr  atTabarī].\nQatādah  (rahimahullāh)  said,  “That  means, be  patient  upon  obedience  to  Allah,  outlast  in patience the people of deviance, perform ribāt for the cause of Allah, {and fear Allah that you may be successful}” [Tafsīr at-Tabarī].\nMuhammad Ibn Ka’b al-Quradhī (rahimahullāh) said, “{And perform ribāt} against My enemy and your  enemy  until  he  abandons  his  religion  for your religion” [Tafsīr Ibn al-Mundhir].\nThe āyah is a command to perform the well-known ribāt  for  Allah’s  cause  at  the  frontier  posts,  as  it was interpreted by ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbās from the Sahābah (radiyallāhu ‘anhum) and by al-Hasan alBasrī, Qatādah, Zayd Ibn Aslam, and Muhammad Ibn Ka’b from the Tābi’īn (rahimahumullāh).\nAs for the hadith reported by Muslim from Abū Hurayrah (radiyallāhu ‘anh) in which Rasūlullāh (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  said,  “Shall  I  not tell you that by which Allah erases your misdeeds and raises your ranks? Completing wudū’ despite hardships (cold weather and minor wounds), taking many steps towards the masājid (for prayer), and waiting for the next prayer after the prayer ends. Indeed,  this  (waiting)  is  ribāt,”  then  the  hadith is similar to those ahādīth describing jihād to be exerting oneself in obedience to Allah, hijrah to be abandoning what Allah dislikes, and Islam to be good words and feeding the poor2. It doesn’t limit the meaning of ribāt to waiting for prayer nor does its wording indicate that it’s a commentary on the āyah.  For  this  reason,  at-Tabarī  (rahimahullāh) 2 See the Hikmah section of this issue.\nsaid after quoting the hadith from Abū Hurayrah in  his  tafsīr,  “His  statement  {and  perform  ribāt} means ‘perform ribāt for Allah’s cause against your enemies and your religion’s enemies from amongst the  people  of  shirk.’  I  consider  the  linguistic root  of  ribāt  to  be  binding  (irtibāt)  the  horses in preparation for the enemy just as their enemy binds  their  horses  in  preparation  for  them.  The word  was  then  used  for  every  person  stationed at the frontier posts defending those behind him – throughout the area between him and them – those whom the enemy desires to harm with evil, whether the enemy has horses he has bounded or is on foot without a riding animal for himself. The reason we said that the meaning of {and perform ribāt} is ‘perform ribāt against your enemies and your religion’s enemies’ is because this is the wellknown meaning of the meanings of ribāt. Speech should  be  understood  according  to  the  people’s prevalent  and  well-known  usages  from  amongst its meanings before resorting to the lesser-known meanings  until  a  proof  comes  with  something contrary  requiring  interpretation  of  the  speech according to a lesser-known meaning. This proof obligating submission would be a verse from the Qur’ān, a narration from the Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam), or ijmā’ (consensus) from the people of tafsīr.”\nIbn  Qutaybah  (rahimahullāh)  also  said,  “{And perform ribāt} for Allah’s cause. And the linguistic basis  of  murābatah  (ribāt)  is  a  bond:  That  these people bind their horses and that those ones bind their horses at the frontier post. Each prepares for his  counterpart.  So  the  presence  at  the  frontier posts was named ribāt” [Gharīb al-Qur’ān].\nMany  people  also  don’t  realize  the  difference between ribāt (defending the frontier posts) and hirāsah (guard duty). One might be on ribāt but not  on  hirāsah,  like  the  murābit  at  the  frontier post sleeping, eating, exercising, talking, reading, or praying before or after his shift for hirāsah. He might be a murābit at the frontier post cooking and cleaning for the other murābitīn, waiting and prepared to defend the front against any attempt by the kuffār to advance, but never having a hirāsah shift due to being needed in another service while \ndabiq\n\f"

This is probably because such a person – in some regards –  forsakes  aspects  of  Islam  including  hearing,  obeying, jamā’ah, jihād, masājid, etc. \nAnd  according  to  some  scholars,  moving  to  dārul-kufr from Dārul-Islām is apostasy, whereas others confirm that it borders apostasy.\nMany Syrians died on the roadto dārul-kufr\nIbn Mas’ūd  said, “The taker, giver, and contractor of ribā – if they know the deal is ribā – as well as the giver and receiver of tattoos for beauty, the abandoner of zakāh, and the revert to being a Bedouin after hijrah are all cursed upon  the  tongue  of  Muhammad    until  Resurrection Day” [Reported by an-Nasā’ī from Ibn Mas’ūd].\nIbn  Hazm  said,  “If  he  moves  there  [the  lands  of  the crusaders  and  pagans]  for  the  sake  of  what  he  might acquire from dunyā but lives there like a dhimmī – despite being able to join the body of the Muslims and reach their land – then his deed is not far from kufr and we find no excuse for him” [Al-Muhallā].\nThe  Prophet    said,  “The  muhājir  can  stay  three  days in Makkah after completing his [‘Umrah or Hajj] rites” [Reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim from al-‘Alā’ Ibn alHadramī].\nAl-Hasan Ibn Hayy (died 169AH) said, “If a man moves to  dārul-harb  without  apostatizing  from  Islam,  he  is  a murtadd for abandoning Dārul-Islām” [Mukhtasar Ikhtilāf al-‘Ulamā’ – at-Tahāwī].\n‘Alī  Ibn  Abī Tālib    said,  “Indeed,  the  major  sins  are seven.” The people were noisy, so he repeated his statement three times and then said, “Will you not ask me about them?” They said, “O Amīrul-Mu’minīn, what are they?” He replied, “Shirk, murder, defaming the chaste woman, taking the wealth of the orphan, taking ribā, fleeing from battle,  and  going  back  to  the  desert  as  a  Bedouin  after hijrah” [Reported by at-Tabarī in his tafsīr].\nAl-Qādī  ‘Iyād  said,  “The  Ummah  has  ijmā’  on  the prohibition  of  the  muhājir  abandoning  his  hijrah  and returning  to  his  homeland  and  that  the  muhājir  going back  to  being  a  Bedouin  is  a  major  sin”  [Sharh  Sahīh Muslim – an-Nawawī].\nIbn  Hajar  said  while  commenting  on  the  hadīth  of  al‘Alā’  Ibn  al-Hadramī  quoted  above,  “From  the  fiqh  of this  hadīth  is  that  residence  in  Makkah  was  harām  for those who performed hijrah from it before the Conquest of Makkah. But it was permissible for one who intended it for Hajj or ‘Umrah to remain there for not more than three days after completing his rites” [Fath al-Bārī].\nIt is important to note that in the hadīth of Ibn Mas’ūd  \nGoing  back  to  dārul-kufr  is  certainly  a  major  sin  that can reach the level of apostasy if it entails, for example, voluntarily  moving  to  a  land  where  the  person  will  be forced  into  kufr,  as  the  excuse  of  coercion  is  not  valid when the individual brings this condition upon himself. Similarly is the case if he agrees to stipulations of kufr – such as cooperating with the kuffār against the Muslims – so as to be permitted entry into dārul-kufr. This is kufr even if he does not go through with his promise. {Have you not considered those who practice hypocrisy, saying to their brothers who have disbelieved among the People of the Book, “If you are expelled, we will surely leave with you, and we will not obey, in regard to you, anyone – ever; and if you are fought, we will surely aid you.” But Allah testifies that they are liars. If they are expelled, they will not leave with them, and if they are fought, they will not aid them. And [even] if they should aid them, they will surely turn their backs; then [thereafter] they will not be aided} [Al-Hashr: 11-12]. And there are many other acts of kufr that one can potentially fall into when travelling to dārul-kufr.\nMay Allah facilitate for the Muslims hijrah to the Khilāfah despite the plots of the crusaders and the apostates.\ndabiq\n\fdeeds  would  certainly  be  accepted,  and  thereafter  they would certainly have a pious ending! May Allah protect our hearts and deeds from hypocrisy and pride.\nAnd  so,  for  the  sake  of  clarification,  in  these  pages  of history  we  briefly  present  a  list  of  militants1  and  even “mujāhidīn”  who  fell  into  blatant  apostasy  by  either siding  with  the  crusaders  or  the  tawāghīt  against  the mujāhidīn  or  entering  into  the  religion  of  parliaments and tāghūt presidencies. Thereafter, one should not be surprised when he sees the various factions in Shām or elsewhere siding with the Sahwah, the tawāghīt, or the crusaders, against the Islamic State.\nAfghanistan\nThe Western agentAhmad Shah Massoud\nAbdul Rasul Sayyaf (former head of the “Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan,” now a member of the tāghūt parliament), Burhanuddin Rabbani (former head  of  the  “Islamic  Society  of  Afghanistan,”  died chairman  of  the  Afghan  High  Peace  Council),  and Ahmad  Shah  Massoud  (former  military  commander, died commander of the “United Islamic Front”), were all  former  leaders  of  the  major  factions  that  fought against the communist Russians and thereafter against the  communist  Afghans.  All  three  fought  alongside ‘Abdullāh ‘Azzām  and were formerly praised by him in  his  speeches  and  letters.  After  the  collapse  of  the communist  Afghan  regime,  they  together  along with  others  established  the  so-called  “Islamic  State of  Afghanistan”  in  “1992.”  This  “state”  would  later organize  the  “United  Islamic  Front  for  the  Salvation of Afghanistan” AKA the “Afghan Northern Alliance,” which fought on behalf of the crusaders and tawāghīt, this  becoming  most  manifest  after  the  blessed operations of September 11th.\n1  Note:  Some  of  the  individuals  and  factions  that  will  be  mentioned  never  fought  for Allah’s cause to begin with – similar to the condition of many of the factions in Shām – and yet some of the ignorant consider them “mujāhidīn” just because they fought against crusaders, communists, and other kuffār for nationalist reasons.\nTajikistan\nAbdullo Nuri (former head of the “Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan”) fought against the communists of Tajikstan. Amīr Khattāb of Chechnya  himself came to  Tajikistan  for  jihād  and  fought  alongside  various groups there, including those allied with Nuri. Nuri’s group later signed a peace treaty with the communist apostates. The party then became a major member of the tāghūt parliament, thereby apostatizing from Islam.\nLibya\nAbdelhakim  Belhadj  (Abū  ‘Abdillāh  as-Sādiq),  Abdel Wahab  Qaid  (Abū  Idrīs  al-Lībī),  Abdel-Hakim  alHasidi,  Sāmī  Mustafā  as-Sā’idī  (Abul-Mundhir  asSā’idī),  were  all  former  members  of  the  “Libyan Islamic  Fighting  Group”  whose  leadership  was  based in  Afghanistan  before  September  11th  and  whose fighters executed numerous operations in Libya against the tāghūt Gaddafi and his apostate regime. Many of these  leaders  had  once  accompanied  Shaykh  Usāmah Ibn Lādin  in Afghanistan. After the collapse of the Taliban  emirate,  the  leaders  of  the  “Libyan  Fighting Group”  were  captured  by  the  crusaders  and  later handed  over  to  and  released  by  the  crusader  puppet Gaddafi. These former jihād leaders would later join the tāghūt parliament and partake in the shirkī elections after fighting in the war against the tāghūt Gaddafi in “2011.”\nSomalia\nSharif Sheikh Ahmed was the chief commander of the Islamic  Courts  Union  in  “2006.”  During  this  time, he  fought  against  the  tāghūt  Transitional  Federal Government of the Republic of Somalia. After the fall of Mogadishu to the African crusaders and the Somali apostates,  he  fled,  only  to  return  to  Somalia,  run  in its  shirkī  elections,  and  become  its  tāghūt  president, \nThe murtadd Abdelhakim Belhadj\ndabiq\n\f"

Allah  said, {And He shares not His legislation with anyone} [Al-Kahf: 26].\nWe also write this for the wives of the Sahwāt who superficially claim Islam and stuck out their necks for their secular-oriented brothers and supported them with their lives and with everything precious to them against the muwahiddīn. \nAllah    says,  {And  whoever  is  an  ally  to  them among  you  –  then  indeed,  he  is  [one]  of  them} [Al-Mā’idah: 51].\nFrom amongst the most beautiful stories found in the  books  of  history  is  the  story  of  Zaynab,  the daughter  of  the  Prophet  ,  and  her  husband Abul-‘Ās Ibn ar-Rabī’, who were united by love and marriage, and split apart by kufr and shirk. Abul‘Ās married Zaynab, who was the daughter of his maternal aunt Khadījah . When the revelation descended upon the Prophet , Khadījah and her daughters believed in him and followed his religion, and this included Zaynab. Her husband Abul-‘Ās, however,  rejected  Islam  and  remained  upon  his shirk.  At  that  time,  Islam  had  divided  between every married couple where one of them followed other than Islam. Abul-‘Ās, however, held his wife with him in Makkah. Then, Allah  willed that he would fall prisoner to the Muslims in the battle of  Badr.  The  people  of  Makkah  sent  ransoms  to the Prophet . Here, the Mother of the Believers ‘Ā’ishah Bint as-Siddīq  will continue the story for us. She said, “When the people of Makkah sent ransoms for their imprisoned relatives, Zaynab the daughter of Allah’s Messenger  sent some wealth as a ransom for Abul-‘Ās Ibn ar-Rabī’. She sent a necklace which Khadījah had her wear when she sent  her  to  Abul-‘Ās  to  move  in  with  him  after marriage.” ‘Ā’ishah said, “When Allah’s Messenger  saw it, he felt much pity for her. He said, ‘If \nyou would like to free her prisoner and return her wealth to her then do so.’ They said, ‘Yes, O Allah’s Messenger.’ So they freed him and returned to her what  was  hers”  [Reported  by  Imām  Ahmad  and Abū Dāwūd].\nAnd  it’s  reported  that  the  Prophet    stipulated on  him  that  he  return  Zaynab  when  he  reaches Makkah because she was no longer lawful for him as long as he remained a mushrik. Abul-‘Ās did so, and  Zaynab    left  for  al-Madīnah,  the  land  of Islam. Zaynab left Makkah out of love for Allah and in submission to His command, and did not put her husband and his companionship above the decree of Allah and His Messenger , because {it is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when  Allah  and  His  Messenger  have  decided  a matter,  that  they  should  have  any  choice  about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger  has  certainly  strayed  into  clear  error} [Al-Ahzāb: 36].\nHowever, Allah wished to open Abul-‘Ās’s heart to the truth many long years after his wife’s hijrah, so he came to the Prophet  declaring his Islam, and so the Prophet returned Zaynab to him.\nThen  there’s  Umm  Sulaym  Bint  Milhān  likewise refusing  to  marry  a  kāfir  and  stipulating  that  he embraces Islam as her mahr (dowry). It was reported on the authority of Anas  who said, “Abū Talhah proposed to Umm Sulaym, so she said, ‘By Allah, one  such  as  yourself  cannot  be  rejected,  O  Abū Talhah, but you are a kāfir man and I am a Muslim woman, and it is not permissible for me to marry you. So if you embrace Islam, then that will be my mahr, and I will not ask from you other than that.’ So  he  embraced  Islam  and  that  was  her  mahr” [Reported by an-Nasā’ī and Ibn Hibbān].\nSo then that is Islam. It declares it loudly, clearly, and  explicitly:  {They  are  not  lawful  [wives]  for them,  nor  are  they  lawful  [husbands]  for  them} [Al-Mumtahanah: 10]. So there is no Islam with kufr,  no  tawhid  with  shirk,  and  no  īmān  with nifāq. And this small Muslim home is the core of the Ummah, and the parable of these two spouses and  their  children  is  like  that  of  a  plant  that \ndabiq\n\fThe Sharī’ah court in ad-Dānā after being assaulted by the treacherous Sahwāt\nAfter that, Allah blessed Shām and its people by repelling and reversing the Sahwah Coalition’s plot and by granting the Islamic State authority in  the  blessed  land  of  Shām  and strengthening  its  religion  –  the religion of the cheerful warrior  – in ar-Raqqah, al-Barakah, al-Khayr, Halab, Hims, and elsewhere. Then the conquests expanded in the east, thus  ‘Irāq  was  liberated  in  Mosul, al-Anbar,  al-Fallūjah,  Salāhuddīn, Karkūk  and  elsewhere.  And  its soldiers continue to hope for Allah’s further  support  and  the  conquest of Constantinople and Rome.\nCoalition  and  its  councils  to  fail.  It  conquered some of the towns and villages in Shām, like al-Bāb, I’zāz, ad-Dānā, and others which used to be ruled by the Nusayrī regime and then by the resistant parties  like  the  Free  Syrian  Army  and  its  allies who resisted the Sharī’ah and its rulings. Thus, the Islamic State ruled those towns and villages with what Allah had sent down on His Messenger , established in them the hudūd, commanded the good,  forbade  the  evil,  and  judged  between  the people by the Sharī’ah.\nTherefore,  the  groups  of  apostates,  hypocrites, innovators,  corruption  spreaders,  rebels,  and partisans  –  having  diverse  hearts  but  allied  to one  another  –  thought,  evaluated,  plotted, collaborated amongst each other, and all of them participated in the concocted treachery… A few supposedly “neutral” groups remained outside of this coalition, like a confused lamb, neither with this side nor the other, and Allah’s help is sought.\nIn  the  beginning,  the  wicked  Sahwah  Coalition in  Shām  consisted  of  “Jaysh  al-Mujāhidīn,”  the “Islamic Front,” “Jabhat Thuwār Sūriyā,” the Free Syrian Army, and the Jawlānī front.11 Entering into a coalition is by cooperating with it on its aim. It is not a condition that the party signs a membership paper to join the coalition. Also, some of the jihād claimants persist on blatantly lying, claiming that the Jawlānī front did not partake in the Sahwah. So what is then “Majlis Shūrā Mujāhidī ash-Sharqiyyah” (Mishmish)? And what is “Liwā’ Thuwwār ar-Raqqah”? (They were the Jawlānī front’s branch in Wilāyat ar-Raqqah until the 16th of Jumādā al- Ākhirah 1435, more than three months after the beginning of the Sahwah. They are the soldiers of the Syrian called “Abū Sa’d al-Hadramī.” Now they are fighting in ‘Ayn al-Islām and Tall Abyad in one rank together with the Kurdish atheists while shielded by American air cover.)\nThe Islamic State did not conquer a city or village after this malicious plot except that it ruled it by the Sharī’ah of Allah. When the parties of deviance in ar-Raqqah consisting of “Ahrār ash-Shām” and the Jawlānī front (or what is now known now as “Liwā’  Thuwwār  ar-Raqqa”)  plotted  against  the muhājirīn and ansār in it and acted treacherously against them, the muwahhid mujāhidīn expelled them  from  it,  humiliated.  Then  they  spread the  authority  of  the  Sharī’ah  over  the  complete wilāyah.  They  enforced  prayer,  collected  zakah, and founded the Hisbah to command good and forbid evil. They executed the hudūd, judged in their courts by what Allah revealed, returned the rights  of  the  oppressed,  fought  the  kuffār  and apostates,  and  enforced  the  jizyah  upon  AhlulKitāb. Thus, ar-Raqqah witnessed what it had not witnessed before from the rulings of the Sharī’ah. Likewise  was  the  case  of  the  other  cities  and Indeed all the people of Halab know the role that the Jawlānī front played in the Sahwah Coalition, since the interrogators in the Sahwāt’s prisons were security officers from the Jawlānī front. And if a muhājir wanted safety, the Sahwah Coalition used to order him to surrender himself to the Jawlānī front. And this was all done in cooperation with other factions from the Sahwah Coalition as “‘Amr al-Halabī” mentioned in the first days of the Sahwah on the Jawlānī front’s favorite TV channel: AlJazeera…One of the former members of Jawlānī’s “shūrā” council who returned to the Islamic State’s ranks informed us that Jawlānī informed them in a gathering two weeks before the launching of the Sahwah plot, that the parties had agreed upon waging war against the Islamic State soon and that he had attended the gathering in which the decision was made. When he asked Jawlānī about his front’s role in that, Jawlānī mentioned that he had pledged to cover the frontlines with the regime that would be weakened by this plot. (For details, read the interview with the brother in this issue of Dābiq.)So the wicked one knew with certainty what was concocted against the Islamic State and he promised to protect the backs of the factions, allowing them to launch their war against the Islamic State. He thereby made sure that the Jawlānī front would stay far from the foreground and thus present itself as neutral “only” defending the frontlines against the Nusayrī regime, frontlines which the Islamic State was occupied from protecting after the factions stabbed it in the back. Even the image of neutrality, he quickly cast it off and entered as a major player in the wicked Sahwah plot, as his front fought the Islamic State directly or by betraying its soldiers, luring them to imprisonment, and stripping them of their arms.\ndabiq\n\f"

He ordered them to outlast the kuffār in patience and to perform ribāt against the mushrikīn” [Tafsīr at-Tabarī].\nZayd Ibn Aslam (rahimahullāh) said, “Be patient upon jihād, outlast your enemy in patience, and perform  ribāt  against  your  enemy”  [Tafsīr  atTabarī].\nQatādah  (rahimahullāh)  said,  “That  means, be  patient  upon  obedience  to  Allah,  outlast  in patience the people of deviance, perform ribāt for the cause of Allah, {and fear Allah that you may be successful}” [Tafsīr at-Tabarī].\nMuhammad Ibn Ka’b al-Quradhī (rahimahullāh) said, “{And perform ribāt} against My enemy and your  enemy  until  he  abandons  his  religion  for your religion” [Tafsīr Ibn al-Mundhir].\nThe āyah is a command to perform the well-known ribāt  for  Allah’s  cause  at  the  frontier  posts,  as  it was interpreted by ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbās from the Sahābah (radiyallāhu ‘anhum) and by al-Hasan alBasrī, Qatādah, Zayd Ibn Aslam, and Muhammad Ibn Ka’b from the Tābi’īn (rahimahumullāh).\nAs for the hadith reported by Muslim from Abū Hurayrah (radiyallāhu ‘anh) in which Rasūlullāh (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  said,  “Shall  I  not tell you that by which Allah erases your misdeeds and raises your ranks? Completing wudū’ despite hardships (cold weather and minor wounds), taking many steps towards the masājid (for prayer), and waiting for the next prayer after the prayer ends. Indeed,  this  (waiting)  is  ribāt,”  then  the  hadith is similar to those ahādīth describing jihād to be exerting oneself in obedience to Allah, hijrah to be abandoning what Allah dislikes, and Islam to be good words and feeding the poor2. It doesn’t limit the meaning of ribāt to waiting for prayer nor does its wording indicate that it’s a commentary on the āyah.  For  this  reason,  at-Tabarī  (rahimahullāh) 2 See the Hikmah section of this issue.\nsaid after quoting the hadith from Abū Hurayrah in  his  tafsīr,  “His  statement  {and  perform  ribāt} means ‘perform ribāt for Allah’s cause against your enemies and your religion’s enemies from amongst the  people  of  shirk.’  I  consider  the  linguistic root  of  ribāt  to  be  binding  (irtibāt)  the  horses in preparation for the enemy just as their enemy binds  their  horses  in  preparation  for  them.  The word  was  then  used  for  every  person  stationed at the frontier posts defending those behind him – throughout the area between him and them – those whom the enemy desires to harm with evil, whether the enemy has horses he has bounded or is on foot without a riding animal for himself. The reason we said that the meaning of {and perform ribāt} is ‘perform ribāt against your enemies and your religion’s enemies’ is because this is the wellknown meaning of the meanings of ribāt. Speech should  be  understood  according  to  the  people’s prevalent  and  well-known  usages  from  amongst its meanings before resorting to the lesser-known meanings  until  a  proof  comes  with  something contrary  requiring  interpretation  of  the  speech according to a lesser-known meaning. This proof obligating submission would be a verse from the Qur’ān, a narration from the Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam), or ijmā’ (consensus) from the people of tafsīr.”\nIbn  Qutaybah  (rahimahullāh)  also  said,  “{And perform ribāt} for Allah’s cause. And the linguistic basis  of  murābatah  (ribāt)  is  a  bond:  That  these people bind their horses and that those ones bind their horses at the frontier post. Each prepares for his  counterpart.  So  the  presence  at  the  frontier posts was named ribāt” [Gharīb al-Qur’ān].\nMany  people  also  don’t  realize  the  difference between ribāt (defending the frontier posts) and hirāsah (guard duty). One might be on ribāt but not  on  hirāsah,  like  the  murābit  at  the  frontier post sleeping, eating, exercising, talking, reading, or praying before or after his shift for hirāsah. He might be a murābit at the frontier post cooking and cleaning for the other murābitīn, waiting and prepared to defend the front against any attempt by the kuffār to advance, but never having a hirāsah shift due to being needed in another service while \ndabiq\n\fAllah or that I know the unseen, nor do I tell you that I am an angel. I only follow what is revealed to  me”}  [Al-An’ām:  50].  {Say,  “If  you  possessed the  depositories  of  the  mercy  of  my  Lord,  then you would withhold out of fear of spending.” And ever has man been stingy} [Al-Isrā’: 100]. {Or have they the treasures of your Lord? Or are they the controllers [of them]?} [At-Tūr: 37].\nAbsolute  power,  knowledge,  and  ownership  are attributes unique to Allah (ta’ālā). This has always been  the  faith  of  Muslims  since  the  father  of mankind  –  Ādam  (‘alayhis-salām)  –  treaded  the Earth  and  will  continue  to  be  so  until  the  last believer  passes  away  shortly  before  the  Hour. Only Allāh (ta’ālā) knows the minutest details of everything, controls all events, and possesses every atomic particle. Even the pagans of the Jāhiliyyah in the Arabian Peninsula did not doubt that Allah alone  possessed  absolute  power,  knowledge,  and ownership,  but  they  committed  shirk  in  many ways  including  attributing  partial  knowledge  of the unseen to soothsayers, assigning shares of their crops  and  livestock  to  idols,  and  claiming  their idols held some influence to intercede for them. As for claiming their idols, soothsayers, and kings had absolute or near-absolute power, knowledge, \nand ownership, then this was too much for even the corrupted fitrah of the jāhiliyyīn to tolerate.\nSadly, this shirkī attitude (both minor and major) entered the hearts and minds of many supposedly “Islamic”  leaders,  scholars,  and  callers  –  in imitation of the Arab nationalists before them – as  they  began  to  describe  the  enemies  of  Islam with  attributes  bordering  rubūbiyyah  (Allah’s lordship).  To  them,  the  kuffār  had  the  nearabsolute knowledge, power, and ownership to plot and execute any grand conspiracy of their desire. It is almost as if they attribute to them the ability to create with the word “be”! Their evil became most apparent in issues related to jihād. If one desired to perform jihād, these leaders would warn that jihād now was a conspiracy to kill off the sincere Muslim youth and thereby leave the Muslims’ lands to the secularists. If one wanted to join a jihād jamā’ah, they  would  warn  that  it  was  the  creation  of  the kuffār so as to aid in achieving kāfir interests. If jihād  operations  –  like  those  of  September  11th – were carried out against the kuffār, they would claim  these  operations  were  conspiracies  by  the kuffār to justify their aggression against Muslims. If  a  mujāhid  leader  achieved  shahādah,  they would say that the kuffār used him up and needed \nThe blessed raid on the Twin Towersin New York\ndabiq\n\f"

        "@value": "Christians and to destroy that vile race from the lands of  our  friends.”  This  launched  the  Crusades,  which continue today. Popes thereafter, for centuries, overtly and loudly professed their goal of eradicating Islam through war and conversion, as the 15th century Pope Callixtus III made a vow “to extirpate the diabolical sect of the reprobate and faithless Mahomet [Islam] in the East;” and as his predecessor Eugene IV expressed his hope that “very many from the abominable sect of Mahomet will be converted to the Catholic faith” (Council of Basel in 1434).\nAs the war between Islam and the pagan Church raged, and for fear of losing their own followers to Islam, some on the Christian side began speaking more directly about their enemy and the real Islamic goal to destroy their manmade systems and perverted “freedoms.” Benedict XVI – the predecessor of Francis – explained, for example, that democracy “contradicts the essence of Islam, which simply does not have the separation of the political and the religious sphere that Christianity has had from the beginning” (Truth and Tolerance). Despite being a liar, he certainly spoke the truth on this issue – democracy undoubtedly contradicts the essence of Islam – showing thereby that the apostates from Islam, like many of the “imams” in the West and teachers at so-called “Islamic” universities, have less of an understanding of Islam than Benedict the Disbeliever has.\nSome time later, Benedict would again attempt to disparage Islam by mocking the Prophet Muhammad g, but for something the Prophet shared with most of  the  prophets  of  the  Torah,  the  Psalms,  and  the Gospel, which was the order to spread the religion by the  sword.1  Benedict  thus  belittled  the  order  found in the Old and New Testaments for war against the pagans upon quoting the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, who had said, “Show me just what Mohammed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.” The religion of Islam will continue to be spread by the sword, even if Benedict despises such. May Allah expose  Benedict’s  evil  and  inhumanity  and  uncover for the world the true reason behind his scandalous resignation from the pagan Papacy.\nDespite the clarity of past and perished popes re-\n1  To read biblical texts on the obligation of spreading the religion via the sword, see “By the Sword” on pages 78-80 of this issue.\nBenedict XVI, Pope Francis’ predecessor\ngarding their enmity for Islam and its teachings, the current pope, Francis, has struggled against reality to advertise the apostate’s perversion of Islamic teachings as the actual religion of Muslims. So while Benedict and many before him emphasized the enmity between the  pagan  Christians  and  monotheistic  Muslims, Francis’ work is notably more subtle, steering clear of confrontational words that would offend those who falsely claim Islam, those apostates whom the Crusaders found played the perfect role for their infiltration into Muslim lands. While Benedict XVI met public disapproval for quoting a centuries-old Byzantine emperor,  Francis  continues  to  hide  behind  a  deceptive veil of “good will,” covering his actual intentions of pacifying the Muslim nation. This is exemplified in Francis’ statement that “our respect for true followers of Islam should lead us to avoid hateful generalizations, for authentic Islam and the proper reading of the Quran are opposed to every form of violence” (The Joy of the Gospel).\nPart of this approach to subdue Muslims through appeasement  involves  coordinating  with  the  infamous Ash’ari Sufi institute, al-Azhar University, falsely attributed to being representative of Sunni Muslims worldwide. This method is an attempt to justify deviating claims that the Muslim nation has no central authority – as in a caliphate – but is rather “managed” in some way by scholars at universities. Adnane Mokrani, a Tunisian slave to the Catholic Church, commented on Francis’ embracing of Ahmed el-Tayeb – the leader of Cairo’s al-Azhar University – saying, “Islam is not like the Catholic Church. There is no single, central \n\fabominable practices that they have done for their gods, and so you sin against the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 20:16).And as David was quoted, saying to his enemy,  “This  day  the  Lord  will  deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head” (1 Samuel 17:46), and after conquering him, he reportedly beheaded him. “Then David ran and  stood  over  the  Philistine  [Goliath] and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with  it  …  And  David  took  the  head  of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem … And as soon as David returned from the striking down of the Philistine, Abner took  him,  and  brought  him  before  Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand” (1 Samuel 17:51-57).\nOnce the rule of the Lord was established, the sword was not to be put away but rather remain ever-unsheathed to implement the Law. The blasphemer was killed by stoning. “Whoever blasphemes the name of the Lord shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him” (Leviticus 24:16). As for the apostate or any who calls to worshiping other gods, then “you shall not yield to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him, nor shall you conceal him. But you shall kill him. Your hand shall be first against him to put him to death” (Deuteronomy 13:8-9). Likewise, the murderer was executed.  “Whoever  takes  a  human  life  shall  surely be  put  to  death”  (Leviticus  24:17).  And  sodomites were slain. “If a man lies with a male as with a woman,  both  of  them  have  committed  an  abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them” (Leviticus 24:13). Furthermore, there was retribution (known as “qisas” in the Shari’ah). “If anyone injures his neighbor, as he has done it shall be done to him” (Leviticus 24:19), and “you shall pay life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe” (Exodus 21:23-25). In Psalms, a wisdom behind divinely-ordained killing is mentioned. “When He killed them, they sought Him; they repented and sought  God  earnestly”  (Psalms  78:34),  just  as  elsewhere in the Old Testament, one finds that “cursed is he who keeps back his sword from bloodshed” (Jeremiah 48:10).\nEven  Jesus,  whom  the  Christians  have  titled  the \nKilled for the abominable crime of sodomy\n“Prince of Peace,” is recorded in their scripture as saying, “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword” (Matthew 10:34). There is also Jesus’ order to his followers of being armed, as it is said, “And let the one  who  has  no  sword  sell  his  cloak  and  buy  one” (Luke 22:36). Also, while telling a parable, it is written that Jesus said, “But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here  and  slaughter  them  before  me”  (Luke  19:27). As for upholding the Law, then in an apparent move to command virtue and forbid vice, which is chiefly done with physical force, all four “gospels” mention the story of Jesus violently expelling the moneychangers from the temple. “And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. He said to them, ‘It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you make it a den of robbers’” (Matthew  21:12-13).  Furthermore,  everything  that  was mentioned from the Old Testament of war and enforcing laws was kept, unless specifically mentioned otherwise, in the Gospel of Jesus. “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them” (Matthew 5:17).\nHowever, despite these clear references to violently applying  the  Law  of  the  Lord,  Christians  have  cast aside such commandments and instead have followed papal decrees and the sermons of priests – showing that their love for men is greater than their love for the Creator of men. Indeed they have cast aside their \n\f"

This followed an operation conducted two weeks earlier on the 25th of Muharram that targeted one of the heads of kufr from the Bahā’ī sect in Dhaka known as Rūhul-Amīn who works as the director of the Bahā’ī center in the region of Rangpur. He was targeted with silenced pistols, leaving him critically wounded. Also in Rangpur, in the vicinity of Kūnyā, the murtadd Rahmat ‘Alī, a leading member of the ruling Awami League, was returning home on the 27th of Muharram when he was successfully apprehended and killed. In addition to targeting individuals, the soldiers of the Khilāfah in Bengal have also carried out attacks on the murtaddīn’s temples of shirk. On the 14th of Safar, they targeted a Rāfidī temple funded and overseen by the Iranian embassy. The attack took place in Bogra District and resulted in a number of mushrikīn being killed and injured after being hit by automatic weapons fire. Just one month later, our istishhādī brother, Abul-Fidā’ al-Banghālī, entered into a temple of the Qadiyānī murtaddīn in the area of Bagmara in Rajshahi District armed with an explosive belt. He detonated his explosive belt in their midst, injuring 30 of them. May Allah accept him among the shuhadā’. Two weeks later, the soldiers of the Khilāfah eliminated the murtadd known as Samir Uddin – who had become a Christian and was working as a missionary – by stabbing him with a knife in the district of Jhenaidah.\nWilāyat Hadramawt – On the 8th of Safar, the soldiers of the Khilāfah launched a major surprise assault on Yemeni barracks west of Hadramawt. The operation began with an assault on the Shubām, Sirr, and al-Qārrah barracks on the road between the regions of Say’ūn and al-Qutun after first cutting off their supply routes. The mujāhidīn succeeded in capturing the barracks and also targeted support divisions with explosive devices. They also destroyed four military vehicles killing all the soldiers inside, with the Yemeni army then dispatching another force to regain control of the situation. The new force was then targeted by an istishhādī operation carried out by our brother Battār al-‘Adanī. He detonated his explosive vehicle in their midst, killing and wounding dozens of them. May Allah accept him among the shuhadā’. Meanwhile, the soldiers of the Khilāfah succeeded in hitting a helicopter after targeting it with heavy machine guns, and the bulk of these operations led to at least 50 murtaddīn being killed.\nTunisia – On the 12th of Safar, our istishhādī brother Abū ‘Abdillāh at-Tūnusī rushed towards a bus carrying members of the presidential guard on Muhammad al-Khāmis Street in the center of the Tunisian capital. When he reached his target  he  detonated  his  explosive  belt,  killing  nearly  20 \nThe  Qādiyānī  temple  attacked  by the  mujāhidīn  of  Bengal\nThe  remnants  of  the  bus  that  was carrying Tunisian presidential guards\nThe  dead  murtaddīn  killed  by  Abū ‘Abdillāh  at-Tūnusī  (may  Allah  accept  him)\n\f\f"

They left their families and their lands to renew the state of the muwahhidīn in Shām, and they had never known each other until they arrived in Shām! I have no doubt that this state, which  has  gathered  the  bulk  of  the  muhājirīn in Shām and has become the largest collection of muhājirīn in the world, is a marvel of history that  has  only  come  about  to  pave  the  way  for al-Malhamah  al-Kubrā  (the  grand  battle  prior to the Hour). And Allah knows best. The Islamic State has become a reality that everyone can \nsee. Even the apostates cannot ignore its threat, let  alone  the  cross  worshippers  and  the  Jews. Yet those who are falsely associated with jihād turn away from the Islamic State, even publicly declaring their enmity against it in bizarre competition  with  the  crusaders  and  the  apostates. Subhānallāh, what great importance the Islamic State has! And what a tremendous favor it is from Allah to guide one to the Islamic State and grant  him  companionship  with  its  muhājirīn, those  who  plunge  into  the  malāhim  (the  great battles prior to the Hour)! For a man is upon the religion of his close friends, and he does not love a  people  except  that  he  will  be  gathered  with them  on  the  Day  of  Resurrection,  whether  he likes it or not.\nparT 2:\ntHose WHo Break offfrom tHeir triBes\nIbn Mas’ūd (radiyallāhu ‘anh) said that the Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  said,  “Verily  Islam began  as  something  strange,  and  it  will  return  to being  something  strange  as  it  first  began,  so  glad tidings to the strangers.” Someone asked, “Who are the strangers?” He said, “Those who break off from their tribes” [reported by Imām Ahmad, ad-Dārimī, and Ibn Mājah, with a sahīh isnād].\nImām  Abū  Mus’ab  az-Zarqāwī  said,  “Allah  has  described these strangers with a number of characteristics, among them being that they are nuzzā’ of the people, or nuzzā’ from the tribes. The word nuzzā’ is the plural of nazī’ and nāzi’, which refers to a stranger who breaks off from his family and tribe [meaning  he  departs  and  distances  himself  from  them], and the nazā’i’ of the camels are the outsiders. AlHarawī (rahimahullāh) said, ‘By this he [the Prophet] is referring to the muhājirīn who’ve abandoned their homelands and migrated to Allah ta’ālā’” [al-Qābidūna ‘alal-Jamr].\n\fWhen one experiences tribes of this nature after living years in the city, he realizes the wisdom in the words of Shaykh Abū Mus’ab az-Zarqāwī (rahimahullāh). It also becomes easier for him to tie events narrated in the Sunnah and Sīrah of the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  with  events  today.  He then  knows  why  the  Prophet  (sallallāhu ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  treated  the  Arab  and Israelite tribes as collective wholes whenever tribe members broke their covenants with him. This is also how after him, Abū Bakr as-Siddīq (radiyallāhu ‘anh) dealt with the tribes during the wars of apostasy. In the prophetic and siddīqī methodology, the tribes of the era were considered homogenous parties; unique individuals were treated as exceptional cases, not as the general rule. The fuqahā’ call these homogenous, collective  wholes  “tawā’if  mumtani’ah,”  if they resist the Sharī’ah. By definition, if the tribe does not act as a group in opposing the Sharī’ah, it would be obviously wrong to apply this ruling to its members.\nAfter this discussion, it should become clear why the Islamic State dealt with the clans of  Shu’aytāt  as  a  murtadd  party  resisting the  Sharī’ah  with  arms.  These  clans  were left armed after they agreed to submit to the rule of the Sharī’ah with the condition they hand over all heavy weaponry. They then betrayed their covenant by rebelling against the Islamic State. They ambushed Islamic  State  soldiers,  and  then  tortured, amputated, and executed prisoners taken from the ambushes. All these crimes were carried  out  in  opposition  to  the  enforcement of the Sharī’ah.\nThereafter  the  Islamic  State  surrounded  their  villages  and  ordered  them  to hand over the perpetuators of the crimes against  Islam  and  the  Muslims.  The  majority of their clans refused to comply, and \nshu’aytāt PRisONER s\nshu’aytāt PRisONER s\neXecUtiOn OF shu’aytāt tRaitORs\ndabiq\f"

        "@value": "ilies. Because of the Arabic terminologies used by this group either to describe themselves or their beliefs, some contemporary Muslim scholars  have  classified  them  as  possibly  an  apostate sect, not an originally mushrik religion, but upon  further  research,  it  was  determined  that this  group  is  one  that  existed  since  the  pre-Islamic jāhiliyyah, but became “Islamized” by the surrounding Muslim population, language, and culture, although they never accepted Islam nor claimed to have adopted it. The apparent origin of the religion is found in the Magianism of ancient Persia, but reinterpreted with elements of Sabianism,  Judaism,  and  Christianity,  and  ultimately expressed in the heretical vocabulary of extreme Sufism.\nAccordingly,  the  Islamic  State  dealt  with  this group  as  the  majority  of  fuqahā’  have  indicated how mushrikīn should be dealt with. Unlike the Jews and Christians, there was no room for jizyah payment. Also, their women could be enslaved unlike female apostates who the majority of the fuqahā’ say cannot be enslaved1  and can only be given an ultimatum to repent or face the sword. After capture, the Yazidi women and children were then divided according to the Sharī’ah amongst  the  fighters  of  the  Islamic  State  who participated in the Sinjar operations, after one fifth of the slaves were transferred to the Islamic State’s authority to be divided as khums.\nThis large-scale enslavement of mushrik families is probably the first since the abandonment of this Sharī’ah law. The only other known case – albeit much smaller – is that of the enslavement of  Christian  women  and  children  in  the  Philippines and Nigeria by the mujāhidīn there.\nThe enslaved Yazidi families are now sold by the Islamic State soldiers as the mushrikīn were sold by the Companions (radiyallāhu ‘anhum) before _____________1     The enslavement of the apostate women belonging to apostate groups such as the rāfidah, nusayriyyah, durūz, and ismā’īliyyah is one that the fuqahā’ differ over. The majority of the scholars say that their women are not to be enslaved and only ordered to repent because of the hadīth, “Kill whoever changes his religion” [Sahīh al-Bukhārī]. But some of the scholars including Shaykhul-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah and the Ahnāf (Hanafis) say they may be enslaved  due  to  the  actions  of  the  Companions  during  the  Wars  of  Apostasy where they enslaved the apostate women. This opinion is one also supported by evidence, wallāhu a’lam.\nthem.  Many  well-known  rulings  are  observed, including the prohibition of separating a mother from her young children. Many of the mushrik women and children have willingly accepted Islam and now race to practice it with evident sincerity after their exit from the darkness of shirk.\nRasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  said, “Allah marvels at a people who enter Jannah in chains” [reported by al-Bukhārī on the authority of Abū Hurayrah]. The hadīth commentators mentioned that this refers to people entering Islam as slaves and then entering Jannah.\nAbū Hurayrah (radiyallāhu ‘anh) said while commenting on Allah’s words, {You are the best nation  produced  for  mankind}  [Āli  ‘Imrān:  110], “You are the best people for people. You bring them with chains around their necks, until they enter Islam” [Sahīh al-Bukhāri].\nYAZIDIS EMBRACE ISLAM\nAfter this discussion and as we approach al-Malhamah al-Kubrā (the greatest battle before the Hour) – whenever its time comes by Allah’s decree – it is interesting to note that slavery has been mentioned as one of the signs of the Hour as well as one of the causes behind al-Malhamah al-Kubrā.\nRasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  mentioned that one of the signs of the Hour was that “the slave girl gives birth to her master.” This was  reported  by  al-Bukhārī  and  Muslim  on the authority of Abū Hurayrah and by Muslim on the authority of ‘Umar.\ndabiq\fWILAYAT AL-FURAT\nA CHECKPOINT TO PROTECT THE MUSLIMS OF THE NEW WILĀYAH\nISLAMIC POLICE IN THE NEW WILĀYAH\nTHE MARKET IN THE NEW WILĀYAH\ndabiq\f"

        "@value": "expenses in an equally cunning manner. Thus, with the mercy of Allah, Abū Jandal was able to proceed on his hijrah to Shām. He walked towards Allah, and Allah came running to him, as He had promised the believers.\nWhen the news leaked that Abū Jandal had left the country for the Middle East and had not attended the conference, his murtadd maternal uncle, who is connected  with  Bengali  military  intelligence  agency DGFI  (Directorate  General  of  Forces  Intelligence), tried his best to prevent him from entering Shām. Despite the efforts of his uncle and the DGFI, however, Abū  Jandal,  by  Allah’s  grace,  succeeded  in  entering Shām with great ease, underscoring what the Prophet g had said to the young companion ‘Abdullāh Ibn ‘Abbās  j, “Know that if the whole world were to gather  together  in  order  to  benefit  you  something, they would not be able to benefit you with anything other than that which Allah had written for you. And if they were to gather together in order to harm you with something, they would not be able to harm you except with that which Allah had written against you” [Reported  by  at-Tirmidhī].\nUpon entering the blessed land of Shām, his heart was full of joy, and he became the youngest brother among the Bengali muhājirīn. As soon as he joined the  training  camp,  he  informed  the  trainer  that  he wanted to carry out an istishhādī operation and added his name to the list. He was always cheerful and smiling. While awaiting his turn to carry out an istishhādī operation, he joined a battalion and was stationed in ribāt in ‘Ayn al-Islām. Despite his ribāt and fighting, his heart was always concerned for the brothers in his former homeland and the progress of jihād there. He dreamed of Bengal becoming a frontline for the Islamic State and a graveyard for the murtaddīn. When he would come back to the city from ribāt, he would rush to the brothers and inquire about the progress in Bengal. \nHe also used to give sincere nasīhah to the brothers here, and despite growing up in a wealthy family, he always tried to distance himself from city life, preferring instead the toils of jihād. Before leaving to partake in one of the battles in ‘Ayn ‘Īsā, he informed a brother that he did not want to stay in the city and was trying to move to the mountains of Wilāyat Dimashq. At the time, Ramadān was approaching, and his heart was attached to shahādah. He told the brothers with him of his desire for shahādah and prayed that Allah would accept him in the month of Ramadān. He then left for the battle in ‘Ayn ‘Īsā as an inghimāsī. During the course of the operation, he was shot by a 23mm autocannon. The medical team evacuated him from the battlefield and attempted to give him first aid, but he died due to excessive bleeding. The doctor on duty \ninformed the brothers with him that before his last breath he pronounced the shahādah. \nPrior to heading out for the inghimāsī operation, Abū Jandal wrote the following letter to his brothers in Islam:\n“In  the  name  of  Allah,  the  Most  Gracious,  the Most Merciful. All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the Universe, the only one worthy of worship, the only one whose laws will prevail all over the world, the only one in whom the believers should put their trust and hope. To proceed.”\n“This  is  a  sincere  message  from  your  beloved brother living in the blessed lands of the Islamic State. Verily it is Allah’s laws and the sacrifice of the brothers that makes a land blessed. Yā ikhwānī fillāh, four or five months ago I was in the same position as you. I didn’t have any plan as to how to avoid the fitnah surrounding me. I didn’t know how I would ever be able to do jihād fī sabīlillāh. I thought that all my family and friends would boycott me. I was drowning in the same obstacles that you might be going through now. But it is only the promise of Allah, the promise of that Garden in which rivers flow, that kept me going. And it was enough, inshā’allāh.”\n“The following are some points of nasīhah, which I am trying hard to follow and would hope that you, my beloved brothers, would also try to follow. Please note that it is just my duty to give sincere advice to you. Otherwise, I am too small and too sinful to give you advice.”•  “Qiyām al-layl. Yā akhī, it had been the solution for the Sahābah, has been the solution for the brothers, and it will be the same for you, inshā’allāh. Try getting up 15 minutes before Fajr and praying two raka’ah of qiyām al-layl. When you get used to it, then increase by 15 minutes. Is this so hard?”\n•  “Try to make the Qur’ān your best companion. Read it, listen to it, memorize it, spend much time with it, apply it. It is better than gossiping with the  brothers.”\n•  “Try to do regular physical exercise at home. Don’t \nskip this point.”\nIndeed,  Abū  Jandal  was  among  those  brothers who were not satisfied with merely reaching the lands of the Khilāfah and partaking in jihād for the cause of Allah. One can see from his letter that despite being involved in jihād, one of the greatest acts of sacrifice and worship, he continually sought to improve himself and strengthen his relationship with his Lord. May Allah accept him among the shuhadā’ and inspire many more through his words and deeds.\n51\fIt’s a little weird re-visiting all of this more than a year and a half later, but it’s important to reflect on what history has clearly shown was one of the bloodiest and worst-handled hostage crises in modern times. This  was  not  just  my  observation  but  a  sentiment aired by journalists in other pieces published on the matter  subsequently.\nThe stupidity of hardline non-negotiation was obvious at the time as my cellmates were beheaded one after the other. Since most countries choose to negotiate, either above or below the table (and everyone chooses to deal below), then by being the hardliner who does not agree to talk, all you’re doing is condemning your imprisoned citizens to death. Nothing more. You’re not making a big political stand because the whole thing’s invisible and not in the media, you’re not  showing  the  world  how  tough  you  are  for  the same reasons, in fact you’re not making any difference to the global position on hostage-taking whatsoever. The captors don’t check your passport when they grab you and say, “Oh look, this one’s British. We better let him go and just keep all the French instead.” It doesn’t work like that.\nAll you’re doing is just condemning citizens who have gotten themselves into a sticky situation for the sake of a few million dollars which – let’s be honest – doesn’t go very far in today’s world. The Islamic State pumps millions of dollars a day in oil revenue so they don’t even need the proceeds from ransoms and haven’t for quite some time. I don’t claim to speak for them, but I believe it’s reasonable to say that the mujāhidīn continue to seek ransoms only to uphold an order dictated in the Qur’ān. {When you meet those \nwho  disbelieve,  strike  their  necks  until,  when  you have inflicted slaughter upon them, then secure their bonds, and either confer favor afterwards or ransom them until the war lays down its burdens} [Muhammad: 4].\nMake no mistake about it, the mujāhidīn follow the  Qur’ān  to  the  letter,  say  what  they  mean,  and mean what they say. They don’t play games, a fact that was not lost on the European countries whose citizens were prisoners. America, on the other hand, chose to glibly ignore the disaster that was coming their way and today spends more in one day of dropping bombs over the Islamic State as it would have taken to get 26 year-old Kayla Mueller home. Thanks to US policy at the time, all her family got instead was evidence that she was killed by a coalition bomb in ar-Raqqah and a candlelight vigil at their hometown of Prescott, Arizona.\nSo a few months back I watched with interest a 27-minute documentary entitled “The Cost of Living” that was aired on ABC Australia last June. The presenter of the program, Jonathan Holmes, interviewed one  of  my  former  cellmates,  Frenchman  Nicholas Henin. Nic was a peculiar fish but I rather enjoyed his company because he was quiet and said completely weird things. One of my favourite Nic-isms was when he got a sound thrashing from a guard for throwing bread down the toilet and he announced to the room in a high-pitched voice, who had just watched him sail past the door on his head before getting a pretty decent one-two in front of all of us, that “I have just been beeeeeee-ten!” Ah, such happy days.\nWhen  they  got  home  the  four  French  went  on \nNicholas Henin\n\f"

The Islamic State also has some frontlines against them near Darnah, most important of which are Martūbah and an-Nawwār. The Islamic  State  also  targets  their  locations  in  the  city  of Ajdābiyā. The secularist forces of Haftar are targets for the  Khilāfah  soldiers  wherever  these  forces  might  rest.

And how did it all begin? And what is the history of this “majlis” with regards to Islam or kufr?\nAbul-Mughīrah:  This  council  consists  of  two  major elements:  “Abū  Salīm  Martyrs  Brigade”  and  the “Libyan  Islamic  Fighting  Group.”  As  for  the  “Libyan Islamic  Fighting  Group,”  then  its  kufr  is  clear  due  to its  participation  in  the Tarābulus  government  and  the democratic process under the leadership of Abdelhakim Belhadj. As for the “Abū Salīm Martyrs Brigade,” then it was a brigade that was once Salafī. Most of the soldiers of the Islamic State in Darnah were from the brigade’s founders. They abandoned the brigade after it fell into a number of nullifiers of Islam, most infamous of which was its operating as part of the interior ministry in what was known as the “security committee.” This is in addition to  their  security  for  the  tāghūt  Mustafa  Abdul  Jalil, Chairman of the National Transitional Council, when he visited Darnah and called to democracy. Since then, the people of proper methodology abandoned the brigade. They even killed leaders of the brigade who led it to the depths of kufr. All this was before the official expansion of the Islamic State to Libya. After Allah blessed it with \nexpansion to Libya and most of the groups in Darnah pledged  bay’ah  to  it,  the  Abū  Salīm  brigade  requested its opponents from the other groups refer to the court of the Islamic State for a resolution. After studying the condition of the brigade and what it fell into, the court of the Islamic State ruled that the brigade had committed apostasy  and  called  its  individuals  to  repentance.  A number of its followers and leaders repented whereas the remaining  gathered  together  with  the  “Libyan  Islamic Fighting Group” to form what they called “Majlis Shūrā Darnah.”\nDābiq: What is the situation with Ansār ash-Sharī’ah?\nAbul-Mughīrah:  Many  of  the  leaders  and  soldiers  of Ansār ash-Sharī’ah were from the first to pledge bay’ah in  Libya  to  the  Islamic  State.  This  group  continues  to have men who wish to implement the Sharī’ah despite the  groups’  abandonment  of  the  lost  obligation  of  the era and its preference of division to unity, most clear in its lack of a bay’ah to the Khalīfah and in its unity with “revolutionary” movements linked to the apostate regime of Tarābulus in some regions as well as its acceptance in other regions of suspicious aid from filthy hands. It also has contradictory stances from region to region due to the different orientations of its leaders and the alignments of its soldiers. Some of the contradictory stances are also due to the closeness of some of their leaders towards those of “al-Qā’idah in the Islamic Maghrib” present in Libya.\nDābiq: How is the situation in the Libyan wilāyāt with respect to governance?\nAbul-Mughīrah: In Libya, the Islamic State continues to be a young mission as its presence has not completed a full year.

        "@value": "THE BAY’AH FROM  WEST AFRICA\nTHE KĀFIR NIGERIAN ARMY\nAnd what was their response to the favors and blessings of Allah? They showed their gratitude to Him through a deed even greater than those that they had already accomplished; they closed ranks  with  their  brothers  in  the  Islamic  State, uniting upon the truth, pledging to listen to and obey  Amīrul-Mu’minīn  and  to  continue  upon the path to raise high the word of Allah. Their bay’ah was acknowledged by the Islamic State, and the mujāhidīn of West Africa now guard yet another frontier of the Khilāfah. \nThe  Islamic  State’s  spokesman,  Shaykh  Abū Muhammad  al-‘Adnānī  (hafidhahullāh),  said, “And  we  bring  you  the  good  news  today  of the  Khilāfah’s  expansion  to  West  Africa,  for the  Khalīfah  (hafidhahullāh)  has  accepted  the pledge  of  allegiance  made  by  our  brothers  in Jamā’at  Ahlis-Sunnah lid-Da’wah  wal-Jihād. We congratulate the Muslims and our mujāhid brothers  in  West  Africa  on  their  pledge  of allegiance,  and  we  congratulate  them  on joining the caravan of the Khilāfah. So rejoice, O Muslims, for this is a new door that Allah, the Mighty  and  Majestic,  has  opened  so  that  you may  migrate  to  the  land  of  Islam  and  so  that \nyou  may  wage  jihād.  So  whoever  is  stopped by the disbelieving rulers, and prevented from emigrating  to  Iraq,  Shām,  Yemen,  the  Arabian Peninsula,  or  Khurāsān,  will  not  be  prevented –  by  Allah’s  permission  –  from  emigrating  to Africa. So come, O Muslims, to your State, for we call on you to mobilize for jihād and incite you and invite you to emigrate to your brothers in West Africa. And we specifically call upon the students of Islamic knowledge and the callers to Islam. Come forth, O Muslims, to the land of the Caliphate” [So They Kill and Are Killed].\nFollowing the announcement of the bay’ah, and its acceptance by the Islamic State, the Muslims in the various regions of the Khilāfah took to the streets in celebration, for nothing brings greater joy to the believers than to see their brothers unite  with  them  under  one  banner  and  one imām, pledging to wage war against kufr until the religion is entirely for Allah. The condition of the mujāhidīn in West Africa was a condition of unity upon tawhīd, which saw them rallying behind one leader from amongst them to wage war  against  kufr  and  implement  the  Sharī’ah in  their  land.  So  when  they  saw  the  Muslims, \ndabiq\n\fRasūlullāh (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “Allah  (‘azza  wa  jall)  does  not  accept  any deed from a mushrik after he accepts Islam until he departs from the mushrikīn and goes to the Muslims” [Reported by Ibn Mājah and an-Nasā’ī on the authority of Mu’āwiyah Ibn Haydah].\nThe  Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam) took  the  hand  of  Jarīr  Ibn  ‘Abdillāh  (radiyallāhu ‘anh) and said to him, “I take your bay’ah (pledge) to worship Allah alone, establish the prayer, give the zakāh, advise the Muslims,  and  depart  from  the  mushrikīn” [Reported by Imām Ahmad and an-Nasā’ī].\ndabiq\n\f"

        "@value": "every  individual  from  your  Ummah  is,  {So  fight  in  the cause  of  Allah;  you  are  not  held  responsible  except  for yourself}.’ And for this reason, it is incumbent on every believer to wage jihād, even if he has to do so alone. And in that regard is the statement of the Prophet , ‘By Allah, I will surely fight them even if I’m alone’ [Reported by al-Bukhārī from al-Miswar and Marwān], and also the statement of Abū Bakr when the apostasy occurred, ‘And if my right hand were to oppose me, I would wage jihād against it with my left hand.’’”\nThis statement of al-Qurtubī, along with those of other mufassirīn, highlights the magnitude of what the believers have been burdened with. The matter of believing in Allah and then striving to raise high His kalimah – lā ilāha illallāh – is so significant that if one had no choice but to march forth and fight by himself to achieve this, he would have to do so. As such, Allah  reminds His Messenger  and the believers that each individual is only responsible for himself. He should not look around and base his decision to make hijrah and wage jihād for the cause of Allah on what other people are doing. Nor should he hesitate to strike the enemies of Allah  if it’s within his means to do so, even if he were alone.\nOn the statement of Allah, {You are not held responsible except for yourself}, Ibn Kathīr mentions a report from Ibn Abī Hātim that al-Barā’ Ibn ‘Āzib h was asked if a man who encountered a hundred of the enemy and fought them was considered to be from those about whom Allah said, {And do not throw yourselves with your own hands into destruction} [Al-Baqarah: 195]. He replied, “Allah  said to His Prophet, {So fight in the cause of Allah; you are not held responsible except for yourself. And encourage the believers [to fight]}.”\nThus, the believer should be prepared to fight alone when necessary  and  to  incite  others  to  join  him  in  jihād.  He should  not  be  discouraged  by  a  lack  of  numbers  and should  understand  that  the  rewards  of  a  good  deed  are multiplied  when  one  faces  greater  difficulty  in  carrying them out, as is the case when one finds no one to support him in fighting the kuffār, yet courageously marches forward and terrorizes the enemies of Allah nonetheless.\nIn his tafsīr of the aforementioned āyah, al-Qurtubī then explains the statement of Allah {That perhaps Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve}, saying, “Allah restrained the might of the mushrikīn at Badr as-Sughrā (the  Minor  Badr)  and  they  went  back  on  what  they promised the Prophet  of war and fighting1  … Allah 1   The Minor Badr refers to an appointment for battle between the Prophet  and the mushrikīn of Quraysh two years after the decisive battle of Badr. The Prophet  and his companions camped at Badr for eight days waiting for the enemy to arrive. The mushrikīn halted their march towards Badr when they reached the area of Marr adh-Dhahrān, \n{And Allah is greater in might and stronger in punishment} [An-Nisā’: 84]\nalso sufficed the believers at al-Hudaybiyah of what the mushrikīn sought to carry out of treachery and opportunism. Thus, the believers sensed their plot and headed out, capturing them as prisoners, and this occurred as the envoys were going between them to negotiate a truce.2 This is  what  is  intended  by  His    statement,  {And  it  is  He who withheld their hands from you} [Al-Fath: 24] … And Allah  cast  terror  into  the  hearts  of  the  factions  [during al-Khandaq]  and  they  departed  without  any  killing  or fighting, as He   said, {And Allah spared the believers from having to fight}. Likewise, the Jews left their homes and their wealth [near al-Madīnah] without the Muslims battling  them.  So  all  this  is  might  that  Allah  restrained from afflicting the believers, in addition to a large number of Jews and Christians leaving off war and entering into the jizyah agreement in humiliation and submissively. Thus, Allah restrained their might from the believers.”\nThese words altogether carry a monumental lesson for the \nand decided to forego the battle and return to Makkah due to their fear.2   This refers to an incident that took place when the Prophet  was encamped  outside  Makkah  as  the  treaty  of  Hudaybiyah  was  being negotiated with Quraysh. The more zealous youth of Quraysh saw that their leaders wanted a treaty with the Prophet , so they sought to devise a plan that would ruin the negotiations. They decided to head out at night and stealthily move towards the Muslim encampment where they would take action and attempt to ignite a war. Around seventy or eighty of them went out and descended from Mount at-Tan’īm, attempting to sneak towards the Muslim camp, but were all captured by Muhammad Ibn Maslamah, the commander of the Muslim guard. The Prophet  later freed them all to ensure the successful negotiation of the treaty. In this regard, Allah  revealed the āyah, {And it is He who withheld their hands from you and your hands from them within the area of Makkah after He caused you to overcome them} [Al-Fath: 24].\n\fThe Rāfidah and the Jews\nWho Was Ibn Saba’?\nThe Jew Ibn Saba’, like Paul, hated Islam and desired to deviate the Muslims and corrupt their religion by innovating deviant concepts including the godhood, lordship, and second coming of ‘Alī Ibn Abī Tālib h. At the same time, he strived to create strife amongst the Muslim ranks, inciting against the Righteous Khalīfah ‘Uthmān h until ‘Uthmān was killed. The killing of ‘Uthmān led to the deaths of more Muslims and the eventual emergence of the Khawārij, who assassinated ‘Alī h, who Ibn Saba’ had once claimed was Allah!\nAbout him, Ibn Taymiyyah r said, “The first to innovate Rafd was a heretical hypocrite named ‘Abdullāh Ibn Saba’. He wanted thereby to corrupt the religion of the Muslims like Paul – the author of the letters read by the Christians – innovated for the Christians heresies by which he corrupted their religion. Paul was a Jew who hypocritically faked Christianity with the intent to corrupt it. Ibn Saba’ was also a Jew intending the same. He strived to spread falsehood aiming to corrupt the religion, but was unable to do so. However,  some  discord  and  strife  occurred  amongst  the Muslims, strife in which ‘Uthmān h was killed. Thereafter the fitnah transpired” [Majmū’ al-Fatāwā].\nAt-Tabarī r said in his tārīkh, “Ibn Saba’ adopted Islam during the khilāfah of ‘Uthmān. He then toured the Muslims’ lands, trying to deviate them. He started with al-Hijāz, then al-Basrah, then al-Kūfah, then ash-Shām. He did not succeed in launching his plot amongst the people of Shām. They eventually expelled him. He then went to Egypt and called its people. Amongst what he said to them was, ‘How strange are a people who claim that ‘Īsā will return but deny that  Muhammad  will  return,  whereas  Allah   said,  {Indeed,  He  who  imposed  upon  you  the  Qur’ān  will  bring you back to a returning place} [Al-Qasas: 85].2 Therefore, 2   The scholars of tafsīr say that the verse was a promise to the Prophet  that he would once again return to Makkah after being forced out from it.\nThe Tābi’ī ash-Sha’bī r (died 104AH) said, “I warn you against the followers of deviant desires. And the worst of them are the Rāfidah, as they are the Jews of this Ummah. Some of them are Jews who fake Islam to spread their deviance, just as Paul of the Jews faked Christianity to spread his deviance, hoping the Jews would become victorious. The Rāfidah hate Islam just as the Jews hate Christianity. They did not enter Islam longing for Allah or fearing Him, rather out of spite for the people of Islam and so as to  inflict  harm  upon  them.  Their  prayers  do  no  exceed their ears. Indeed, ‘Alī h burned them alive and banished them  to  other  lands.  Amongst  them  was  ‘Abdullāh  Ibn Saba’, a Jew from the Jews of Sanaa, who was banished to Sābāt.”\nHe r also said, “Indeed, the calamity of the Rāfidah is the same as the calamity of the Jews. The Jews say that only a person from the lineage of Dāwūd is suited for kingship. The Rāfidah say that only a person from the lineage of ‘Alī is suited for imāmah. The Jews say that there is no jihād until the Messiah comes forth and a sword descends from the heavens. The Rāfidah say there is no jihād until the Mahdī comes forth and a caller calls out from the heavens saying, ‘Follow him.’ The Jews distorted the Tawrāh. The Rāfidah did the same, distorting the Qur’ān. The Jews are not truthful when they say salām to the believers, rather they say, ‘May sām be upon you.’ And sām means death. The Rāfidah are the same. The Jews consider the wealth of all people to be halāl, as Allah described them in the Qur’ān as saying, {“There is no blame upon us concerning the illiterate [meaning the Arabs]”} [Āl ‘Imrān: 75]. The Rāfidah are the same, as they consider the wealth of all Muslims to be halāl. The Jews consider the blood of all Muslims to be halāl. The Rāfidah  are  the  same.  The  Jews  consider  the  cheating  of people to be halāl. The Rāfidah are the same. The Jews hate Jibrīl and say he is their enemy from amongst the angels. The Rāfidah are the same, as some of them claim that Jibrīl mistakenly descended with revelation upon Muhammad  and abandoned ‘Alī h.”1\nThis is a reality of which there is no doubt. The Jews and the Rāfidah are two sides of the same coin. The religion of Rafd (“Shiism”) was nothing but a plot by a Jew – Ibn Saba’ – following the footsteps of his Jewish predecessor Paul, who had corrupted the pure religion of the Messiah , leaving the Christians upon the Pauline deviance and heresies of the cross, original sin, incarnation, atonement, the lordship, divine sonhood, and godhead of the Messiah, and antinomianism (abandonment of the Law of Mūsā ).\n1   The various statements of ash-Sha’bī were reported by al-Khallāl in “As-Sunnah,”  al-Lālikā’ī  in  “Sharh  Usūl  al-I’tiqād,”  Ibn Taymiyyah  in “Minhāj  as-Sunnah,”  and  others.\nThe Rāfidah of Iran dedicate a memorial  to  dead  Iranian  Jews\n\f"

We  wanted  to  cause chaos (tawahhush) in the lands by killing Brahmi so as to facilitate the brothers’ movements and so that we would be able to bring in weapons and liberate our brothers from prisons. This was the main goal behind killing Brahmi in addition to  the  fact  that  he  worked  in  the  Constituent Assembly making him from the tawāghīt of the country.\nDĀBIQ:  Was  it  difficult  for  you  execute  the operation?\nABŪ MUQĀTIL: All praise is due to Allah. Allah (‘azza wa jall) facilitated the matter so we did not find difficulty. We stayed four hours in front of the home of this tyrant, waiting, until he left the  home  and  entered  his  car.  I  then  moved towards  him  and  killed  him  by  shooting  ten bullets at him.\nDĀBIQ: Can you tell us about the assassination of  the  murtadd  Chokri  Belaid  (coordinator  of the  Democratic  Patriots’  Movement)  and  the \n60 INTERVIEW\nbrothers who took part in the operation?\nABŪ  MUQĀTIL:  The  assassination  of  Chokri Belaid was carried out by our brother Abū Sayyāf Kamāl  Gafgāzī  (may  Allah  accept  him).

Our brother  Ahmad  ar-Ruwaysī  was  killed  recently in a battle against the apostates. He had been imprisoned in Tunis for issues from his past, and alhamdulillāh,  Allah  guided  him  in  prison  and his practice became good. He began making the adhān in prison and attending the lessons given by  the  brothers  despite  the  harassment  from the tawāghīt. When the revolution happened in Tunisia, he was able to escape with the brothers from prison. He then joined the brothers in Libya and took part in some battles with the brothers. When we established a training camp in Libya, he  became  one  of  the  brothers  in  charge  of the  camp.  He  would  train  the  brothers,  as  he excelled in the military field.

Rather  he  fought  merely  to  unify  the “Arab” lands alone under a nationalist “caliphate” that he would rule over, but under the direction of his new crusader masters.\nDuring the various battles he and his sons led in the “Arab Revolt,” their soldiers were accompanied and  supported  by  British  crusaders  including Colonel  Cyril  Wilson,  Colonel  Pierce  C.  Joyce, Lieutenant  Colonel  Stewart  Francis  Newcombe, Herbert Garland, and Captain T.E. Lawrence (the so-called “Lawrence of Arabia”), French crusaders including  Colonel  Edouard  Bremond,  Captain Rosario  Pisanim,  Claude  Prost,  and  Laurent Depui,  and  French  apostates  including  Captain Muhammad  Ould  Ali  Raho.  The  British  would even  intervene  with  their  navy  and  air  force  in battles to give al-Husayn and his sons the upper hand against their rivals. Al-Husayn and his sons meticulously obeyed the orders dictated to them by  the  British  crusaders  so  as  to  guarantee  their backing.  The  British  eventually  appointed  them as kings over Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Hijāz. The current  tāghūt  of  Jordan  is  a  descendent  of  this same family.\nBlack  was  chosen  to  represent  the  ‘Abbāsī  state, white  to  represent  the  Umawī  state,  green  to represent the ‘Ubaydī (“Fātimī”) state, and red to represent  the  late  “Sharīf”2  leadership  of  Hijāz. In  this  symbolism,  he  mixed  between  Islamic khulafā’,  apostate  Ismā’īliyyah,  and  apostate agents.  He  needed  to  give  his  Arab  followers something  symbolic,  historical,  material,  and uniquely  “Arabian”  for  them  to  rally  around. This jāhilī banner became the flag of the so-called “Arab Revolt” he engineered. The flag was initially manufactured in Egypt by the British Military to be raised by their allies.\nSykes’s allies from amongst the Arab nationalists used  a  line  of  poetry  written  by  Safī  ad-Dīn  alHillī  –  who  died  in  750AH  –  to  endorse  these jāhilī symbols. Al-Hillī said, “Our deeds are white, our battles are black, our fields are green, and our swords are red.” No doubt, his line of poetry was written hundreds of years before the “Arab Revolt.”\nSykes, together with his peers and leaders, devised a  plan  to  further  divide  the  broken  Muslims’ lands  into  nationalist  states.  The  Muslims’  lands had  been  polluted  by  pagan  domes  (for  grave worship)  and  plagued  by  manmade  laws  at  the hands of Ottoman rulers, especially in the last two centuries before the eventual collapse of Ottoman reign.  This  fragile  condition  coupled  with  the policy of turkification – which promoted Turkish nationalism and degraded the Arabic language – aided Sykes and his allies in promoting the “Arab Revolt.”\nThe  British  began  negotiating  with alHusayn  Ibn  ‘Alī3    (the  “Sharīf”  of  Hijāz  –  died 1350AH/1931CE)  to  rebel  and  declare  an independent  Arab  nationalist  state.  Al-Husyan Ibn  ‘Alī  revolted  against  his  former  Ottoman masters and declared himself, with the permission of  the  British,  “Sultan  of  the  Arab  Lands”  and “Caliph” over a nationalist “caliphate” erected by 2 The  word  literarily  means  “the  noble.”  The  leaders  of  Hijāz  (Makkah,  al-Madīnah,  and surrounding regions) since 597AH/1200CE up until 1344AH/1925CE all descended from Qatādah Ibn Idrīs al-Hasanī (died 618AH) and were referred to by the title “sharīf” because of their Hasanī lineage. Because of the later generations’ apostasy through shirk and walā’ to the apostates and the crusaders, they are not deserving of this praiseworthy title.\n3 Because the names are similar, it should be noted that everywhere the name al-Husayn Ibn ‘Alī is used here, then it is referring to this crusader agent and not to the noble son of ‘Alī Ibn Abī Tālib (radiyallāhu ‘anh).\n“Sharīf” al-Husayn - The first in a line of Arab tawāghīt used and discarded by the crusaders\ndabiq\n\fThe Current Health Infrastructure\nThe  Islamic  State  provides  the  Muslims  with extensive healthcare by running a host of medical facilities including hospitals and clinics in all major cities through which it is offering a wide range of medical services, from various types of complicated surgery to simpler services such as hijāmah. This infrastructure  is  aided  by  a  widespread  network of  pharmacies  run  by  qualified  pharmacists  and managed  under  the  supervision  and  control  of the Health Dīwān. Just as the medical staff in the hospitals  and  clinics  are  made  up  of  qualified, trained professionals, the pharmacies are likewise only run by qualified and certified pharmacists.\nPreparing for the Future\nIn  order  to  ensure  a  steady  supply  of  qualified medical personnel in the future as well as expanding and enhancing the current medical services from a professional as well as Islamic point of view, the Islamic State recently opened the Medical College in  ar-Raqqah  as  well  as  the  College  for  Medical Studies in Mosul.\nCategoryOutpatientsEmergency PatientsLab TestsMinor X-RaysKidney Dialysis SessionsPhysiotherapy SessionsChildren AdmittedBlood DonorsGeneral SurgeriesBone SurgeriesUrinary SurgeriesNerve SurgeriesEar SurgeriesGynecological SurgeriesEmergency SurgeriesBirthsAudiometric TestsBrain Stem ScansUltrasound ExamsONE-MONTH COMBINED STATISTICS FOR AL-FĀRŪQ AND ‘Ā’ISHAH HOSPITALS (WILĀYAT HALAB)\nAmount6711428915688238444223317011511402611815347165764511400\nThe  pediatric  wing  of  ar-Raqqah’s main hospital\ndabiq\n\f"

He was known to seek the correct Islamic rulings in everything he did, and would never knowingly allow any doubts or falsehood to hold firm in his presence.\nOn  watching  the  early  videos  released  by  alFurqān  Media,  Abū  Qudāmah  would  always express  his  love  for  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq, even before the announcement of its expansion to Shām.\nTowards the end of 2012, Abū Qudāmah found out that his younger brother Yāsīn had become a shahīd in Afghanistan, and this only drove Abū Qudāmah to push ever-harder in his battles as he longed for his chance to give his life for Allah.\nBy  Ramadān,  both  friends  were  fighting  the Nusayriyyah  in  Halab,  and  both  were  injured within a week of each other. Abū Mu’āwiyah’s gunshot  wound  healed  quickly,  whereas  Abū Qudāmah  sustained  a  complicated injury to  his  heel.  It  took  six  months  of  intensive physiotherapy  and  treatment  before  he  could use  the  leg  properly  again.  When  his  plaster cast was finally removed he fell to the ground in prayer, prostrating for a long period in thanks to Allah (ta’ālā).\nOne  year  later  during  Ramadān  (2013),  his longtime  companion  and  best  friend,  Abū Mu’āwiyah,  was  killed  by  a  Nusayrī  sniper  as he  was  trying  to  save  a  fellow  mujāhid,  Abū Mūsā Al-Jazā’irī, who had been wounded in the fighting  while  taking  part  in  operations  in  the town of Salqīn in Idlib. \nHis  shahādah  could  not  have  been  more enviable: He was fasting, it was during the last 10 days of Ramadān, on a Thursday – one of the \nAMONG THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN\nABŪ MU’ĀWIYAH AL-MISRĪ (RAHIMAHULLĀH)\ndays in which a person’s deeds are lifted up to Allah – and all this in the beloved and blessed land of Shām. \nThis affected Abū Qudāmah. He became quite sad  after  the  death  of  his  best  friend,  not because he missed him, but because he’d lost his friend with whom he had always competed. He began showing an even stronger desire for shahādah.  “O  Allah  grant  me  shahādah,”  he would  say  in  du’ā’,  encouraging  the  brothers around him to do the same.\nHe was a different man following the death of his friend. He became even more focused, even more robust in his practice of the religion, and he  learned  many  lessons  through  the  battles with the Nusayrī army. By now, almost all of his companions  had  been  killed  in  battle  for  the cause of Allah.\nAbū Qudāmah developed into a sharp fighter who could see where the fighting in Shām was \ndabiq\n\fwould  watch  the  videos,  it  would  make  him want  to  perform  hijrah  immediately  and  that would have conflicted with his intent to carry out the operations in France.\nDĀBIQ: Do you have a message to the Muslims in general and Muslim sisters in particular?\nUMM BASĪR: Remember {the Day when every soul  will  come  disputing  for  itself,  and  every soul will be fully compensated for what it did, and they will not be wronged} [An-Nahl: 111].\nMy  brothers  and  sisters,  I  call  on  you  to  be concerned about the condition of the Ummah in the world, to act in accordance to such while following the Qur’ān and Sunnah.\nAllah (ta’ālā) gave you minds to think with and intelligence to reason with. Why do you degrade yourselves by thinking you cannot understand the Qur’ān and Sunnah and believing you are in need of the understanding of this imam or that scholar? It is true, we need the people of knowledge in general, but, alhamdulillāh, Allah facilitated the understanding of the Qur’ān and Sunnah. {All praise is due to Allah, who has sent down upon His Servant the Book and has not made therein any crookedness} [Al-Kahf: 1].\nStudy the Sīrah of the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and the stories of the Companions. Observe what the goal of their lives was. Their goal  was  to  worship  Allah  as  He  wants  to  be worshipped not as our desires dictate.\nI saw from amongst you generous people with enthusiasm. Do not lose these traits by following certain individuals. Sincerely ask Allah to guide you. Strive against your inner selves so that you might succeed.\nO Allah, show us the truth as truth and guide us to follow it. And show us falsehood as falsehood and guide us to avoid it.\nMy sisters, be bases of support and safety for \nA BRIEF INTERVIEW WITH UMM BASĪR AL-MUHĀJIRAH\nyour  husbands,  brothers,  fathers,  and  sons. Be advisors to them. They should find comfort and  peace  with  you.  Do  not  make  things difficult  for  them.  Facilitate  all  matters  for them. Be strong and brave. It is essential that you make all your deeds sincerely for Allah’s face and hope for His reward. Know that the Companions  (radiyallāhu  ‘anhum)  did  not spread Islam in these vast lands except with their  righteous  wives  behind  them.  Do  not waste  your  time  and  energy  in  play,  futility, and  what  does  not  concern  you.  Learn  your religion! Learn your religion! Read the Qur’ān, reflect upon it, and practice it. Nourish your love of Allah and His Messenger. It is essential for you to love Allah and His Messenger more than  your  own  selves,  your  husbands,  your children, and your parents. Follow the example of Āsiyah – the wife of Pharaoh – who left the Dunyā  for  Allah  and  the  Hereafter  although she  was  a  queen  and  had  the  wealth  of  the Dunyā.  She  was  tortured  and  killed  because of  this  choice,  but  Allah  kept  her  firm  and raised her above many women. And all praise is due to Allah, the Forgiving and Generous. Follow  the  example  of  Maryam  (‘alayhassalām)  in  her  chastity,  modesty,  obedience of Allah, and truthfulness, which was one of her greatest traits, and so Allah chose her and raised her above many women. And all praise is  due  to  Allah,  the  Majestic.  There  were many  righteous  women  in  history,  so  follow their example. Be patient. Patience is a great virtue. May Allah, the Bestower, provide you with patience. The life of the believer is full of trials and tribulations. So be patient while hoping for Allah’s reward. Life is short, even if  it  appears  sometimes  –  during  times  of sorrow – to be long. By Allah, what awaits us is better and ever-lasting, inshā’allāh. We ask Allah for support and success. And there is no might nor power except by Allah. \n{Exalted is your Lord, the Lord of might, above what  they  describe.  And  peace  upon  the messengers. And praise to Allah, Lord of the worlds}  [As-Sāffāt: 180-182]. \ndabiq\n\f"

While its fighters defend and slowly expand IS-held  territory,  other  IS  leaders and  administrators  are  engaged  in bringing  order  and  repairing  social services  and  public  utilities  in  the areas  they  hold,  a  pattern  seen previously in Syria and Iraq. IS also is both exploiting its new geographical position  —  via  successful  attacks in  Tunisia,  and  support  for  the in  Egypt’s  Sinai IS  organization Peninsula  —  and  preparing for further  advances  from  Libya  into Algeria,  Morocco,  Mauritania,  and Sudan.  Libya  also  gives  IS  crossborder access to Niger and Chad, both of which facilitate direct contact with IS’s  expanding  Nigerian  ally  Boko Haram.  In  addition,  Niger  affords easy entry into Mali where desperate Islamist  organizations  might  well be  enticed  to  cooperate  with  IS  so as to benefit from its military know how,  reputation  for  success,  ample treasury,  and  the  return  of  veteran Malian  mujahedin  who  have  been fighting  with  IS  in  Syria,  Iraq,  and Libya.\n3)  Afghanistan:  IS’s  presence in Afghanistan is just a year old but its fighters  are  reported  to  be  deployed in more than half of the country’s 34 provinces, in and near the capital of Kabul, and in Pakistan’s tribal region, Baluchistan Province, and the city of Karachi.

(NB: This is not to argue that a multi-Muslimnation  intervention  by  U.S.-NATO forces is needed. First, that mother of all Western interventions would be the single most powerful ally for IS’s goal of uniting the Sunni world. Second, the  U.S.  military  is  worn  out  after two  decades  of  war-losing;  is  being neutered  by  Obama’s  calculatedto-destroy  budget  cuts,  manpower reductions,  and  effeminization;  and the NATO militaries — save Turkey’s — are tiny, antiquated, underfunded, and  could  not  stop  Putin’s  panzers from  rolling  down  the  Champs Elysees  without  using  nuclear weapons.  The  only  effective  U.S.NATO  defense  against  the  Islamists is  to  stop  all  intervention,  and  let the  Sunnis,  Shias,  and  Israelis  settle their differences in whatever merrily murderous manner pleases them.)\nCurrently, IS leaders appear to have three  strong  regional  beachheads from which they intend to expand, as well as one strategic economic target: four  maritime  choke-points  that,  if closed or even sporadically attacked, \nwould disrupt the world’s supply of oil and hence its economy.\nin \nthe \nstrongly \n1)  The  Balkans:  IS  has  established itself Islamist communities of Bosnia, Kosovo, and Albania, and has a presence in each of the other Balkan states. In this effort, IS has capitalized on what is now a decades  long  campaign,  that  began with  the  USSR’s  demise,  in  which Saudi Arabia, its Gulf partners, and their  NGOs2  have  converted  large numbers  of  Balkans  Muslims  from being  nominal  believers  to  being Muslims  well-schooled  in  the  warprone Salafi and Wahhabi doctrines. The  Saudi-led  effort3  has  not  yet made the Balkans a bastion of those doctrines, but it is yielding increasing numbers  of  Balkan  Muslims  who have  become  Salafis  and  Wahhabis. These  converts  have  challenged in and succeeded in displacing  more  moderate Islamic leaders,  building  Islamist organizations  that  have  sporadically attacked  individuals,  security  forces, and buildings, and have sent a steady 2  Editor’s  Note:  The  tawāghīt  of  Āl  Salūl  and  their  allies work together to portray themselves as the caretakers of Islam and the Muslims, when in actuality they propagate deviance, lewdness, and even sodomy through their “Rotana Group” and their other entertainment and religious outlets, never mind the fact they rule by international and domestic manmade laws and support the Jews and Christians against Islam and the Muslims. Their weak and hypocritical support of “da’wah” – in many cases – backfired and led to people studying the Qur’ān and the Sunnah, adopting tawhīd and sharī’ah, and declaring takfīr and jihād against the very forces and agents of Āl Salūl.3 Editor’s Note: See previous footnote.\nseveral  cases \n\fThe  soldiers  of  the  Khilāfah  take  control  of the eastern coast of the city of Darnah\nState fights the apostates of the Libyan army at a number of  locations  near  the  city  of  Binghāzī,  most  important of which are as-Sābirī and al-Laythī. The Islamic State also has some frontlines against them near Darnah, most important of which are Martūbah and an-Nawwār. The Islamic  State  also  targets  their  locations  in  the  city  of Ajdābiyā. The secularist forces of Haftar are targets for the  Khilāfah  soldiers  wherever  these  forces  might  rest. We will not slack in fighting them until there is no more fitnah and the religion is all for Allah.\nDābiq:  What  is  the  situation  with  the  murtaddīn  of “Majlis Shūrā Darnah”? And how did it all begin? And what is the history of this “majlis” with regards to Islam or kufr?\nAbul-Mughīrah:  This  council  consists  of  two  major elements:  “Abū  Salīm  Martyrs  Brigade”  and  the “Libyan  Islamic  Fighting  Group.”  As  for  the  “Libyan Islamic  Fighting  Group,”  then  its  kufr  is  clear  due  to its  participation  in  the Tarābulus  government  and  the democratic process under the leadership of Abdelhakim Belhadj. As for the “Abū Salīm Martyrs Brigade,” then it was a brigade that was once Salafī. Most of the soldiers of the Islamic State in Darnah were from the brigade’s founders. They abandoned the brigade after it fell into a number of nullifiers of Islam, most infamous of which was its operating as part of the interior ministry in what was known as the “security committee.” This is in addition to  their  security  for  the  tāghūt  Mustafa  Abdul  Jalil, Chairman of the National Transitional Council, when he visited Darnah and called to democracy. Since then, the people of proper methodology abandoned the brigade. They even killed leaders of the brigade who led it to the depths of kufr. All this was before the official expansion of the Islamic State to Libya. After Allah blessed it with \nexpansion to Libya and most of the groups in Darnah pledged  bay’ah  to  it,  the  Abū  Salīm  brigade  requested its opponents from the other groups refer to the court of the Islamic State for a resolution. After studying the condition of the brigade and what it fell into, the court of the Islamic State ruled that the brigade had committed apostasy  and  called  its  individuals  to  repentance.  A number of its followers and leaders repented whereas the remaining  gathered  together  with  the  “Libyan  Islamic Fighting Group” to form what they called “Majlis Shūrā Darnah.”\nDābiq: What is the situation with Ansār ash-Sharī’ah?\nAbul-Mughīrah:  Many  of  the  leaders  and  soldiers  of Ansār ash-Sharī’ah were from the first to pledge bay’ah in  Libya  to  the  Islamic  State.  This  group  continues  to have men who wish to implement the Sharī’ah despite the  groups’  abandonment  of  the  lost  obligation  of  the era and its preference of division to unity, most clear in its lack of a bay’ah to the Khalīfah and in its unity with “revolutionary” movements linked to the apostate regime of Tarābulus in some regions as well as its acceptance in other regions of suspicious aid from filthy hands. It also has contradictory stances from region to region due to the different orientations of its leaders and the alignments of its soldiers. Some of the contradictory stances are also due to the closeness of some of their leaders towards those of “al-Qā’idah in the Islamic Maghrib” present in Libya.\nDābiq: How is the situation in the Libyan wilāyāt with respect to governance?\nAbul-Mughīrah: In Libya, the Islamic State continues to be a young mission as its presence has not completed a full year.

May blessings and peace be upon the Prophet and Messenger who disciplined and taught his companions, and upon those who are guided by his Sunnah and follow him with excellence until the Day of Judgment. As for what follows:\nIndeed, when the Sharī’ah of our Lord was eliminated, the laws and rulings of the kuffār gained power in the lands of the Muslims, Islam was shamefully abandoned, and faces turned towards promiscuous Europe, the voice of falsehood rose and with it the voices of those hostile towards the people of the religion, and the cancer of those who legislate besides Allah c ate away at the Ummah’s body. They prohibited what He permitted, and permitted what He prohibited, and one of the most manifest things that they ruined and defamed in defense of women and their rights – as they claimed  –  was  polygyny.  They  utilized  their  podiums  to that end, including the podiums of the kufrī parliaments and the secular TV channels, and placed on these podiums howling dogs, fools who do not perceive nor know their foolishness. Their poisoned words crept into the hearts of women from the lands of the Muslims, to the point that we almost couldn’t find a single woman that is accepting of this issue, except for those whom Allah protected.\nAllah c said in His clear-cut revelation, {And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then mar-\nry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice]} [An-Nisā’: 3]. This is a verse as clear as the sun that does not require extensive explanation or interpretation. Therefore, O slaves of Allah, you may marry two, three, or four women, unless you fear that you will have shortcomings in your fairness towards them or will fail to fulfill their rights, in which case you suffice with one wife. Ibn Kathīr r said, “His statement {two or three or four} [An-Nisā’: 3] means marry any women  you  wish  apart  from  the  orphans.  If  one  of  you wishes he may marry two, and if he wishes, three, and if he wishes, four.”\nIndeed, Islam was not the first to introduce polygyny. Rather, it was present in the sharī’ah of those before us. Allah’s Messenger g said, “Sulaymān Ibn Dāwūd q said, ‘I will surely  have  intercourse  with  a  hundred  women  tonight, or ninety nine, and every one of them will give birth to a knight who will wage jihād for the cause of Allah…’” [Reported from Abū Hurayrah by al-Bukhārī].\nWhat’s  strange  is  that  the  Jews  and  the  Christians  taunt the Muslims with respect to polygyny, yet if they were to look into their own books they would’ve known that it was something present in their religions, for it is stated in their books that Ya’qūb n had two wives and two concubines, and that Dāwūd n had a number of wives and concubines, as mentioned in 2 Samuel [5: 13] and 1 Samuel [25: 42 – \n191919\nNOTHINGTWO, THREE, OR FOUR\n\fJamā’ahOr Jāhiliyyah\nAllah’s Messenger g said, “Whoever sees something from his leader that he dislikes, then he should be patient with him, for whoever parts from the Jamā’ah a handspan and dies, dies a death of  jāhiliyyah” [Reported by alBukhārī and Muslim from Ibn ‘Abbās].\nAllah’s  Messenger  g  said,  “Whoever  leaves  obedience,  parts  from  the Jamā’ah, and dies, dies a death of  jāhiliyyah” [Reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim from Abū Hurayrah].\nAllah’s Messenger g said, “Whoever withdraws his hand from obedience will meet Allah on Resurrection Day without having any excuse.

I’ve  had  to  become  pretty  tough  inside,  sometimes  just  to  get  through  each  day.  The  Sheikh who originally captured James Foley and me back in November 2012 said, “to go through this you will need a heart of stone.” And he was right. I try to  stay  very  calm,  tolerant  and  accepting  of  my situation. Muslims call it ‘Qadr Allah,’ the will of God, who determines everything in advance. I am thankful for any comfort I receive and for every plate of food I get.\nIt hasn’t been an easy road, and some of us had a bumpy ride. Once we were finally put into general population with dozens of European prisoners, we had to watch them all go home to their loved ones while we, the British and Americans, were left behind. That was a bitter pill to swallow, but  nothing  compared to what came next. Now I’ve had to watch as James, Steven Sotloff, David Haines and Alan Henning walked out of the door, one every two weeks since August 18th, never to return, knowing they were going to be killed and going to their deaths. \nAnd  now  they’re  gone,  their  faces  and  deaths plastered all over the world’s headlines, four foolish policy victims.\nWhat does that do to a man? After enduring years of pain, darkness and regret, to see it all end in such a  ghastly  way  when  everyone  else  went  home, to  see  ordinary  guys,  family  men,  loving  fathers killed  because  their  governments  wouldn’t  negotiate because of ‘policy,’ wouldn’t even discuss options for saving them with their families – can you begin to imagine how that feels? This wasn’t a fateful soul taken at random, it was individuals missing for years in one of the most high-profile hostage crisis seen in modern history, with dozens \nof  witnesses  who  had  gone  home  testifying they were alive and could be helped. I believe even the mujahidin were genuinely surprised at how easily our countries left us for dead. \nWe’d  come  all  this  way,  putting  one  foot  in front  of  the  other,  supporting  one  another when  it  got  tough,  praying  together  every day. We used to call it the Dead Zone when things got bad, after the area Everest climbers face above 26,000 feet as they approach the summit, when every step is agony, when they hardly have enough strength to carry on. We never  gave  up  hope  that  our  nations  would negotiate for our release.\nBut all that time, we never knew that the decision regarding our fate had been made months beforehand in Washington and Whitehall. We never knew that our families, for whom it was like being locked up in prison with us, were being blanked by the governments or being told there  was  nothing  they  could  do.  We  never knew that the families were left to themselves to try anything and everything, while the men in charge folded their arms and offered their sympathies.\ndabiq\f"

He  came  one  day and asked me to work with Israeli intelligence. I told him that I’d think about it, and then went and  asked  my  father  and  brother  what  they thought. They both encouraged me to do it and told me that it was a very good job. They told me that there was a lot of money in it, and that you could advance to higher positions. I knew at that point that they themselves were working as spies.\nDĀBIQ: What are their names?\nMURTADD:    My  father’s  name  is  Sa’īd  Ismā’īl Musallam.  My  brother’s  name  is  Ismā’īl  Sa’īd Ismā’īl Musallam.\nDĀBIQ: What  happened  when  you  decided  to take the job?\nMURTADD:  I met a guy named Eli. This Eli is an intelligence  official  and  is  responsible  for  the checkpoints in the West Bank. He came to our home  and  met  with  my  father.  My  father  advised  me  in  front  of  him  and  was  telling  me about the job, and Eli talked to me about the benefits and compensation and about the job itself.\nDĀBIQ: How much were you paid?\nMURTADD: In general, the pay would be proportional to the assignment and its level of importance, and the minimum would be 5,000 Shek-\nels.  The  bigger  the  assignment  and  the  more valuable the information, the more they would pay me and the more bonuses I would receive.\nDĀBIQ: Did you receive training?\nMURTADD: Yes, they sent me to a training camp in  East  Jerusalem  –  ‘Anatawt  Training  Camp. That’s where I began my training. I went through a training course on self-control and on how to survive  an  interrogation.  I  also  did  a  training course on information extraction – how to get information out of people. They also gave me weapons training. I attended the training camp for one month and completed my training.\nDĀBIQ: Were you paid during training?\nMURTADD: Yes, I received 5,000 Shekels as payment during training.\nDĀBIQ:  Were  there  other  Palestinians  being trained with you?\nMURTADD: There were nine of us being trained, but all of them were Jews; I was the only Arab.\nDĀBIQ:  What  happened  when  you  completed your training?\nMURTADD: After I completed my training, I began  working  as  a  spy  in  the  people’s  midst.  I was specifically tasked with turning in weapons dealers, anyone who was wanted, anyone looking to infiltrate Jewish territory, and to report to the intelligence any operation planned to be executed in Jerusalem.\nDĀBIQ: How did you eventually wind up spying on the Islamic State?\nMURTADD:  I  came  home  one  day  and  a  guy named Miro was there.

Indeed, he claimed that the same model (cutting finances, recruitment tools, and the will to fight) that worked so “well” in the degradation of the mujāhidīn there before their pledge of allegiance, would work just as well on the Islamic State.\nSome things just don’t work out as planned.\nThe energy behind this movement is fearsome. A single lion can kill an antelope but a pride that is hungry and cunning enough can, if they work closely together, take down an African elephant. As groups of mujāhidīn from around the world join  forces,  so  the  strength  behind  the  Islamic State  puts  them  in  a  position  to  devour  much larger prey.\nThe  West  and  its  allies  have,  once  again,  been caught  completely  by  surprise  as  they  now  find themselves  fighting  not  just  one  enemy  in  Iraq and  Shām,  but  now  an  international  army  of mujāhidīn  numbering  hundreds  of  thousands in  different  countries,  whole  continents  apart. It’s taken the coalition the best part of a year to put together a campaign against the Islamic State that is only now seeing a Shia mob supported by coalition aircraft make moves against Tikrit, but that’s old news before it’s even begun. Why focus on Tikrit when the Middle East, Africa, and Asia are now on fire?\nAnd  this  movement  shows  no  sign  of  abating. Indeed, this quickening, this coming together of Islamic groups sharing the same focus and purity of belief is only intensifying. And the more groups that join, the stronger the movement becomes.\nAs  the  groups  evolve  from  splintered  cells  each waging their own wars to a single, unified body, it becomes a force of immense power, like a snowball that  rolls  down  a  mountain  getting  larger  until you end up with an avalanche. The more outfits work together, so they can use each other’s skills and strengths to fill in the gaps until there are very few weak points.\nRAND crusader Jonah Blank\n“Say one group is very good at bomb making and the other group is very good at propaganda,” says Jonah  Blank  from  the  US  “think-tank”  RAND Corporation.  “If  you  put  the  right  bomb  in  the right  place  for  the  right  propaganda  effect,  that can  be  far  more  important  than  either  of  these things on their own.”\n“This isn’t just propaganda,” said Gary Bernsten, a former CIA intelligence officer on an interview with Fox News on 9th March. “ISIS has billions of dollars. They have a network of communications for reaching out to these groups. And it shows you how deadly and effective ISIS is. They are truly the most  successful  Sunni  terrorist  group  in  history because  they’ve  carved  out  a  space  for  a  nation state,  and  these  other  groups  recognize  that.  It shows Obama’s statement that ‘this isn’t Islam’ is a false narrative. ISIS has been brilliant at selling itself  to  the  hundreds  of  millions  of  people  out there looking for a message.”\nAnd what of Obama of late? In all honesty, I haven’t seen what the Nobel Peace prizewinner has been commenting  on  recently,  but  he  can’t  be  having much fun. “This strategy of taking out terrorists \ndabiq\n\f"

He was known to seek the correct Islamic rulings in everything he did, and would never knowingly allow any doubts or falsehood to hold firm in his presence.\nOn  watching  the  early  videos  released  by  alFurqān  Media,  Abū  Qudāmah  would  always express  his  love  for  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq, even before the announcement of its expansion to Shām.\nTowards the end of 2012, Abū Qudāmah found out that his younger brother Yāsīn had become a shahīd in Afghanistan, and this only drove Abū Qudāmah to push ever-harder in his battles as he longed for his chance to give his life for Allah.\nBy  Ramadān,  both  friends  were  fighting  the Nusayriyyah  in  Halab,  and  both  were  injured within a week of each other. Abū Mu’āwiyah’s gunshot  wound  healed  quickly,  whereas  Abū Qudāmah  sustained  a  complicated injury to  his  heel.  It  took  six  months  of  intensive physiotherapy  and  treatment  before  he  could use  the  leg  properly  again.  When  his  plaster cast was finally removed he fell to the ground in prayer, prostrating for a long period in thanks to Allah (ta’ālā).\nOne  year  later  during  Ramadān  (2013),  his longtime  companion  and  best  friend,  Abū Mu’āwiyah,  was  killed  by  a  Nusayrī  sniper  as he  was  trying  to  save  a  fellow  mujāhid,  Abū Mūsā Al-Jazā’irī, who had been wounded in the fighting  while  taking  part  in  operations  in  the town of Salqīn in Idlib. \nHis  shahādah  could  not  have  been  more enviable: He was fasting, it was during the last 10 days of Ramadān, on a Thursday – one of the \nAMONG THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN\nABŪ MU’ĀWIYAH AL-MISRĪ (RAHIMAHULLĀH)\ndays in which a person’s deeds are lifted up to Allah – and all this in the beloved and blessed land of Shām. \nThis affected Abū Qudāmah. He became quite sad  after  the  death  of  his  best  friend,  not because he missed him, but because he’d lost his friend with whom he had always competed. He began showing an even stronger desire for shahādah.  “O  Allah  grant  me  shahādah,”  he would  say  in  du’ā’,  encouraging  the  brothers around him to do the same.\nHe was a different man following the death of his friend. He became even more focused, even more robust in his practice of the religion, and he  learned  many  lessons  through  the  battles with the Nusayrī army. By now, almost all of his companions  had  been  killed  in  battle  for  the cause of Allah.\nAbū Qudāmah developed into a sharp fighter who could see where the fighting in Shām was \ndabiq\n\f"

        "@value": "artIcle\nthe Da’Wah of nuh\npart 2:\nas we are attempting within this article to deal with the root of the issue – the issue of giving the people choice, we state:\nthe da’wah of prophet nūh (‘alayhis-salām) followed  a  policy  from  the  very  beginning  that was completely opposed to the methodology of  choice.  In  fact,  it  was  characterized  in  contrast to this by a frank, early warning of the consequence  of  deviation  and  opposition  to  the truth.\nallah  ta’ālā  said:  {and  we  had  certainly  sent nūh to his people, [saying], “Indeed, I am to you a clear warner. that you not worship except allah. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a painful day.”} [hūd: 25-26]\nash-shawkānī  (rahimahullāh)  says,  “the  sentence {Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a painful day} is explanatory. It means: ‘I warned you against worshipping other than allah because  I  fear  for  you’. this  sentence  contains  a true  warning.  Furthermore,  the  painful day referred to is the day of Judgment or the day of the flood.”the  word  “or”  in  ash-shawkānī’s  state-\nment  above  undoubtedly  combines  both  items mentioned. this is because the punishment promised  by  nūh  (‘alayhis-salām)  includes  both  the punishment  of  hellfire  on  the  day  of  Judgment, and the punishment of drowning in the flood in this dunyā. as a result, his people were ultimately afflicted by both punishments. allah ta’ālā said: {because of their sins they were drowned and put into the Fire, and they found not for themselves besides allah [any] helpers} [nūh: 25] .\nwhat  gives  the  issue  further  clarity  is  that  when the conflict erupted between nūh and his people, and the day of the flood drew closer, the threat in nūh’s tone towards his people increased. In fact, he  entirely  abandoned  the  tone  of  debate  that they  were  accustomed  to,  especially  after  being informed  through  revelation  that  no  one  else from among his people would believe from that day forward apart from those who had already believed.\nFrom amongst the threats he made to his people is that mentioned in the following statement of allah ta’ālā: {and he constructed the ship, and when-\n\fassault began in the morning and included a group of  inghimāsiyyīn  plunging  into  the  enemy  ranks, with support from the mortar team, a tank, a BMP, a 23 millimeter gun, and some doshkas. The mujahidīn killed many PKK soldiers, with around 20 of their corpses being removed from the battlefield. They then advanced to a position on high ground called  “the  home  of  Ahmad  Munīr,”  which  overlooks the town of Jarāblus. \nNumerous weapons were captured as ghanīmah, including  assault  rifles,  PKC  machine  guns,  RPG launchers and rounds, a sniper rifle and a night vision scope. During the course of the battle there was one shahīd and a number of light injuries. This battle was just one of a number of successful advances made against the PKK on numerous fronts, including the capture of the village of Kindār and a  number  of  other  villages  adjacent  to  it  on  the western  front  of  Tal  Abyad  on  the  11th  of  Ramadān, with the advance continuing towards ‘Ayn Al-’Arab. This was in addition to a number of operations against the PKK within their main strongholds,  including  istishhādi  operations  carried out against  the  PKK/Peshmerga  murtaddīn  in  both Iraq and Shām, as well as a number of PKK vehicles blown  up  by  the  Islamic  State’s  undercover  cells in Wilāyat Al-Barakah, all leading to many of their apostate soldiers being killed. \nMay  Allah  continue  to  humiliate  the  secularist murtaddīn in all their colors and stripes.\nthe IstIshhaDI abu hafs at-tunusI\nghanImah from Zur maghar\npounDIng the pKK In Zur maghar\ndabiq\f"

        "@value": "FOREWORD\nThe  Khalīfah  (hafidhahullāh)  said,  “O  Muslims everywhere, glad tidings to you and expect good. Raise  your  heads  high,  for  today  –  by  Allah’s grace – you have a state and khilāfah, which will return your dignity, might, rights, and leadership. It  is  a  state  where  the  Arab  and  non-Arab,  the white  man  and  black  man,  the  easterner  and westerner  are  all  brothers.  It  is  a  khilāfah  that gathered  the  Caucasian,  Indian,  Chinese,  Shāmī, Iraqi, Yemeni, Egyptian, Maghribī (North African), American, French, German, and Australian. Allah brought  their  hearts  together,  and  thus,  they became brothers by His grace, loving each other for the sake of Allah, standing in a single trench, defending and guarding each other, and sacrificing themselves  for  one  another.  Their  blood  mixed and became one, under a single flag and goal, in one pavilion, enjoying this blessing, the blessing of faithful brotherhood. If kings were to taste this blessing, they would abandon their kingdoms and fight over this grace. All praise and thanks are due to Allah. Therefore, rush O Muslims to your state. Yes, it is your state. Rush, because Syria is not for the Syrians and Iraq is not for the Iraqis. The Earth is Allah’s. {Indeed, the Earth belongs to Allah. He causes to inherit it whom He wills of His servants. And the [best] outcome is for the righteous} [AlA’rāf:  128].  The  State  is  a  state  for  all  Muslims. The  land  is  for  the  Muslims,  all  the  Muslims” [A  Message  to  the  Mujāhidīn  and  the  Muslim Ummah in the Month of Ramadān].\nNationalism, patriotism, tribalism, and revolutionism were  never  the  driving  forces  inside  the  heart of  the  muwahhid  mujāhid.  For  him  to  lose  his tongue would be more beloved to him than to voluntarily utter slogans of nationalist Jāhiliyyah. Rather, the banners of nationalism are beneath his  dusty  feet,  as  they  oppose  Tawhīd  and  the Sharī’ah  and  represent  the  kufrī  and  shirkī ideologies brought to the Muslim world by the two crusaders: Sykes and Picot.\nAmongst  the  greatest  deeds  the  muwahhid performs  is  his  rejection  of  nationalism.  Rather, his  Islam  is  not  correct  until  he  disbelieves  in nationalism, as nationalism declares people equal \n4 FOREWORD\nregardless of their religion, it does not discriminate between them accordingly, it limits the religion to a nationalist border, and it prohibits its expansion beyond.  For  these  reasons,  nationalism  was innovated by the West, as through it, they elevated their  dhimmī  brethren,  empowered  apostasy  in the  Muslims’  lands,  divided  and  conquered  the Muslim  peoples,  and  defended  the  crusaders’ lands from offensive jihād.\nThe  tāghūt  Fir’awn  ruled  his  people  through factionalism,  a  predecessor  to  nationalism. {Indeed, Fir’awn exalted himself in the land and made its people into factions, oppressing a sector among them, slaughtering their [newborn] sons and keeping their females alive. Indeed, he was of the corrupters} [Al-Qasas: 4].\nAnd the Muslims were ordered to fight everyone that stands in the way of this religion becoming manifest  over  all  others,  not  to  terminate  its expansion upon reaching national borders. {It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion, even if the mushrikīn despise such} [At-Tawbah: 33]. {And fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah. And if they cease – then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do} [Al-Anfāl: 39].\nAnd  the  kuffār  can  never  be  the  equals  of  the Muslims  even  if  both  were  to  come  from  the same land. {Then will We treat the Muslims like the criminals? What is [the matter] with you? How do you judge?} [Al-Qalam: 35-36]. {Or should we treat those who believe and do righteous deeds like  corrupters  in  the  land?  Or  should  We  treat those who fear Allah like the wicked?} [Sād: 28].\nTherefore, pure tawhīd and nationalism can never coexist.\nFinally, nationalism must be disbelieved in so that victory can be achieved for Islam and the Ummah. {Allah  has  promised  those  who  have  believed among you and done righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession [to authority] upon \n\fTHE ALLIES OF AL-QĀ’IDAH IN SHĀM\nmade you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you} [Al-Hujurāt: 13]. Second, it contradicts the creed of walā’ and barā’ – a great fundamental of the religion – and uproots it. The Arab Iraqi Christian is their brother who has all rights whereas the Indian  or  Turkish  Muslim  has  no  rights.  The Sharī’ah of these people necessitates preferring ‘Uqbah  Ibn  Abī  Mu’ayt  and  Abū  Jahl  to  Bilāl the  Ethiopian  and  Salmān  the  Persian.  Third, it  opposes  the  bond  between  the  believers. Rasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alahyi  wa  sallam)  said, ‘The  believer  to  the  believer  is  like  a  building, each  part  holding  up  the  other’  [Reported  by al-Bukhārī and Muslim on the authority of Abū Mūsā al-Ash’arī]. He (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) also  said,  ‘The  example  of  the  believers  with regards to their love, mercy, and sympathy is like that of a single body, if a limb feels pain, the rest of  the  body  responds  to  it  with  sleeplessness and fever’ [Reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim on  the  authority  of  an-Nu’mān  Ibn  Bashīr].  … Fourth, it is based upon the da’wah to jāhiliyyah and  partisanship.  Allah  (ta’ālā)  said,  {When those who disbelieved had put into their hearts hamiyyah – the hamiyyah of Jāhiliyyah} [Al-Fath: 26].  Rasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam) said, ‘Whoever calls to ‘asabiyyah (factionalism) is not one of us’ [Reported by Abū Dāwūd on the authority of Jubayr Ibn Mut’im]” [Adhillah ‘AlalMu’minīn A’izzah ‘Alal-Kāfirīn].\nAmīrul-Mu’minīn  Abū ‘Umar  al-Baghdādī (rahimahullāh)  also  said,  “Sadly,  some  of  the fledglings of secularism spread the occupation’s lie, formulated a basis for it, argued in favor of it, and raised the banner of blindness in the name of  nationalism  and  patriotism,  both  of  which are exactly what the Magian state constitution entails.  They  made  the  resources  of  Iraq  – especially  the  water  and  oil  –  the  property  of those who possess Iraqi citizenship! So what if Rasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  were to migrate to our lands? Indeed, he (sallallāhu ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  migrated  to  a  land  other than his and settled in a home other than his. \n8 ARTICLE\nSo  are  those  resources  halāl  for  him  and  his Companions  in  accordance  with  the  doctrine of  these  people?  No.  As  for  him  (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and the muhājirīn after him having authority and leadership, then for that to occur would necessitate facing the harshest of opposition from these people! How not, when these people are those who said, ‘Iraq is for all the  Iraqis  and  its  resources  are  the  property of all the Iraqis.’ Yes, for all of the Iraqis, even if they are from the Yazīdī devil worshippers or Sabian  Mandaeans.  All  of  them  according  to them  have  equal  rights  whether  he  is  a  Sunnī Muslim or Rāfidī Magian! It does not concern him whether this Iraqi worships our Glorious Lord or a rebellious devil. His right will be protected! O muwahhidīn, our creed is that a Muslim is our brother  even  if  he  is  a  Filipino  Asian  and  that the devil worshipper is our enemy even if he is definitely Iraqi” [Fa’ammaz-Zabadu Fayadhhabu Jufā’ā].\nOn “25 December 2014,” the Shāmiyyah Front was  announced  in  Aleppo.  It  consists  of  the “Islamic”  Front,  the  Army  of  “Mujāhidīn,”  the “Nūr ad-Dīn Zinkī” Movement, “Fastaqim Kamā Umirt,” the Authenticity and Development Front, and most recently, the Hazm Movement. Most of these factions are members of the nationalist Syrian Revolutionary Command Council. All these factions receive supposedly “unconditional” aid from either the Gulf regimes, the CIA, the Syrian National Coalition, or the Free Syrian Army (FSA) Supreme Military Council while “not belonging” to  any  of  them.  In  “February  2015,”  the  new front  agreed  with  the  Kurdish  Autonomous Democratic  Administration  and  the  People’s Protection  Units  (YPG)  –  the  armed  branch  of the Democratic Union Party (PYD), which is the Syrian  branch  of  the  Kurdistan  Workers’  Party (PKK)  –  to  implement  the  Sharī’ah  in  ‘Afrīn! How  exactly  the  nationalist  “Islamists”  plan  to implement  the  “Sharī’ah”  alongside  Marxist and  democratic  secularists  is  unfathomable. One question to ask them is whether or not the crusader planes backing the PKK in ‘Ayn al-Islām will aid in the implementation of the “Sharī’ah”…\n\f"

        "@value": "creatures and facilitated for them a means of communication not fathomable by either of them!\nIt was a moment of reflection like no other, a blessing from Allah c. After my shift was over, I rushed to speak about it with another murabit, Abul-Muthanna as-Sumali2  .  For  several  months  together,  we  had both been in the ranks of the Islamic State, then operating in the Levant under the name “Jabhat an-Nusrah.” I told him about the experience with the cat and he smiled, appreciating Allah’s signs in His creation. \n2  Abul-Muthanna  as-Sumali  (Ali  Dirie)  was  a  man  of  great character and worship. After being imprisoned by the Crusaders for seven years, he was able to flee Canada despite being banned from  travel.  He  planned,  strove,  and  relied upon Allah alone, until he arrived in the Levant. When I first met him, he would regularly read from the same mushaf that had accompanied him in his Canadian prison cell. Upon the official expansion of the Islamic State to the Levant, he rushed to revive the Muslim Jama’ah through his bay’ah. He was not affected by the doubts of the jihad claimants and remained firm upon his covenant. Several weeks later, he had a dream in which the Hur (the maidens of Paradise) gave him glad tidings of martyrdom on a specific date (one which I have forgotten). A week before his martyrdom, several of our friends decided to go shopping for new military attire. He told them he wouldn’t be going with them, because he was expecting martyrdom soon, and narrated to them his dream. When that day arrived, it happened that all Islamic State soldiers were placed on alert due to sudden advances of the Nusayri army and their Rafidi allies on the frontlines near Kafar Hamrah (in the  northern  Aleppo  countryside).  Abul-Muthanna  rushed  to battle and advanced in the direction of the enemy, fighting, until he was severely wounded, bleeding until he surrendered his soul to his Lord. Due to the intensity of enemy fire, it was not possible to extract his body from the forward position he had reached. May Allah accept him and add the blessing of caliphate we enjoy today to the scroll of his good deeds and that of all other martyrs.\nThe conversation led us to reflect more upon others of Allah’s signs, even expressing our good assumptions on the revival of the caliphate with the continuation of jihad in the Levant, by Allah’s permission. Abul-Muthanna later went on his ribat shift, observing the same cat and looking out for any potential Nusayri soldiers.I  don’t  remember  now  if  it  was  then  or  sometime shortly before, when I had sat at our base near Aleppo and penned a list of different signs in Allah’s creation to contemplate while on ribat. I later asked Abul-Muthanna if he’d like me to share the list with him. He was very encouraging. So I read to him different  items  on  it  and  he  would  comment  on  how they were undoubtedly from Allah’s many signs manifesting His wisdom, knowledge, greatness, power, and mercy, as well as His constant support for Islam and the Muslims. It was an invigorating conversation of faith, one which was difficult to hold in the West, as the  Muslim  would  find  himself  a  stranger  amongst the herds who had been westernized by the Murtadd Brotherhood.\nHere, I’ll mention briefly some of the signs we had discussed. But before doing so, let me present an example for the atheists and agnostics of the West who will probably read these words, those odd disbelievers who  arrogantly  deny  Allah  and  haughtily  resist  the testimony  of  their  very  own  fitrah  (natural  human disposition), which Allah instilled in them. Allah c said, “And it is He who begins creation; then He repeats it, and that would be easier for Him. His is the sublime example in the heavens and earth. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise” (Ar-Rum 27-28). In these verses, Allah c teaches us what the “sublime ex-\n\fone speaking on behalf of the Muslims, said, “O king, we were an ignorant people who worshiped idols, ate animal  carcasses,  committed  fornication,  cut  family ties, and harmed our neighbors; and the strong among us would devour the weak.”\n“We remained this way until Allah sent to us a messenger  from  among  us  whose  lineage,  truthfulness, trustworthiness, and chastity we knew. He called us to the oneness of Allah, ordering us to worship Him and abandon what we and our fathers were worshiping besides Him of stones and idols, and ordered us to be truthful in speech, to render trusts [to whom they are due], to mend family ties, to be good to our neighbors, and to withhold from forbidden matters and unlawful bloodshed, and he forbade upon us fornication, false speech, devouring an orphan’s wealth, and accusing chaste women of fornication. He commanded us to worship Allah alone and not make any partners  for  Him  in  worship  and  ordered  us  with prayer,  zakah  (charity),  and  fasting.  So  we  affirmed his truthfulness and believed in him, and we followed him in what he had brought us of Allah’s religion.”“We worshiped Allah alone, not making any partners for Him, prohibited what he forbade upon us, and  allowed  what  he  permitted  for  us,  so  our  people became hostile towards us. They tortured us and sought  to  turn  us  away  from  our  religion  through enticement and oppression in order to take us back to worshiping idols instead of Allah the Exalted, and to permitting the wicked things we used to permit. Thus, when they subjugated us, oppressed us, made things difficult for us, and stood between us and our religion, we left for your land. We chose you over others besides you, and we desired your protection and hoped that we would not be wronged in your presence, O king.”\nAshamah asked him, “Do you have anything of that which he has come with from Allah?” Ja’far replied, “Yes.” So Ashamah said, “Then read it to me.” So Ja’far read to him from the first section of Surat Maryam. Ashamah wept until his beard became wet and his patriarchs also wept until their books became wet when they heard what Ja’far recited to them. Ashamah then said,  “Indeed,  this  and  what  Jesus  came  with  have come  from  the  same  lamp.”  He  then  told  the  two representatives  from  Quraysh,  “Go,  for  by  Allah  I will not surrender them to you and they will not be harmed.” So they left, and ‘Amr said to ‘Abdullah, “By Allah, tomorrow I will bring to him something from them by which I will uproot their joy.”\nThe next day, ‘Amr said to Ashamah, “O king, they utter a tremendous statement concerning Jesus Son of Mary.”1 So Ashamah summoned Ja’far and the Muslims with him and asked them what they say about Jesus. Ja’far said, “We say about him like our prophet g taught us – that he is the slave of Allah, His messenger, His [chosen] spirit, and His word which He cast into the pure virgin Mary.” Ashamah then picked up a cane and said, “By Allah, Jesus Son of Mary does not exceed what you have mentioned so much as the length of this cane.” His patriarchs then snorted, so he said to them, “By Allah, even if you snort!” (Sirat Ibn Hisham).\nYears later, when the letter of the Prophet g reached him,  he  readily  declared  his  testimony  of  faith,  responding to the Prophet g with the following words:“In the Name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful. To Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, from Negus Ashamah: May Allah’s peace be upon you, O Prophet of Allah, as well as His mercy and blessings; there is no god but Allah.”\n“As for what follows: Your letter has reached me, O Messenger of Allah, including what you mentioned of the matter of Jesus. By the Lord of the heavens and the  earth,  Jesus  is  not  more  than  what  you  say.  Indeed, he is as you have stated. We have learned that with  which  you  have  been  sent  to  us,  and  we  have hosted your cousin and his companions. Thus, I bear witness, with truth and affirmation, that you are the Messenger of Allah, and I pledge allegiance to you. I have pledged allegiance to your cousin and, at his hands, have submitted to Allah, the Lord of creation” (Zad  al-Ma’ad).\nThus, after having been entrusted with the care and protection of the noble family and companions of the Prophet g, Ashamah’s relationship with Allah’s Messenger g took on a new turn. By embracing Islam, he had effectively nullified his loyalty to the disbelievers and grasped the firm handhold of Islam, making it the only scale that would define his relationship with others. This became manifest when he cut off his ties to the Byzantine emperor, Heraclius, by cancelling the tribute he used to pay to him. Ibnul-Qayyim mentions that when the Prophet g sent ‘Amr Ibn al-‘As to the two kings of Oman with his letter calling them \n1  Here, ‘Amr was referring to the fact that the Prophet g and his companions declared that Jesus was not the son of Allah as was falsely claimed by Christians after the distortion of their religion.\n\f"

A country, I called it. I know nothing about nation building. I’m so foolish I never even made it to university. But after dismissing some of the things I’ve written in the past as “ISIS propaganda,” many journalists and scholars in the West are now agreeing with this sentiment. The Islamic State, they say, is a genuine state.\nThis reality of the Caliphate is confirmed by many things, the people living under its governance, for one. For the first time in years, Muslims are living in security and their businesses  are  doing  a  roaring  trade.  The  zakāh  system has been up and running, taking a percentage of peoples’ wealth and dispersing it to the poor. The gold dinar coins \nfirst mentioned a year ago are now being minted, in preparation for their circulation. Sharī’ah courts are established in every city and are judging by the laws of Islam. Corruption, before an unavoidable fact of life in both Iraq and Syria, has been cut to virtually nil while crime rates have considerably tumbled.\nMeanwhile the Gulf states all around are in turmoil. They are  broken  by  religious  differences  and  fractured  by  ancient tribal feuds. The “Middle East … is broken, angry and so dysfunctional that it’s in a class all by itself, giving new meaning to the word ‘hopeless,’” wrote scholar Aaron David Miller in Foreign Policy on 11th September. “It is so torn apart and riven with sectarian, political, and religious hatreds and confrontations that it seems beyond the capacity of any external party to remedy.” It’s precisely for reasons like this that the Islamic State has arisen so fast and in such a short space of time. There is only one sect here, Sunni Islam, and the Caliph can only be from one tribe, Quraysh. Here in the Caliphate, there is no room for pluralism.\nIn an article published in The Telegraph on 8th June, Ruth Sherlock wrote, “The jihadists have become fastidious bu-\n4747\nPARADIGM SHIFT: PART II\n\fOn 25 Dhul-Qa’dah 1436, Abū Firās as-Sūrī – formerly official spokesman of the Jawlānī front, currently a Jawlānī front leader and head of its “shar’ī academies” – published an article exposing the deviance of the Jawlānī front’s allies and consequently his own deviance and that of his party. He titled the piece: “I Am the Nude Warner.” Although he criticizes the factions in general, his major criticisms focused  on  “Ahrār  ash-Shām.”  Below  are  excerpts  from  his lengthy article:\n“They trick the people and say, ‘A project for the Ummah.’1 They then interpret this whenever they need as a project for Syria alone, encompassing only its land and revolutionaries … This playing on words is an attempt to beautify the  proposals  of  the  kuffār  and  apostates.  The  sammā’īn [the avid listeners to the kuffār] do this so as to offer the kuffār’s proposals through themselves as Islamic proposals. They beautify the proposals and offer them as if the proposals were their own, when the reality is they are nothing but the messengers of the apostates, and in the best case, they are parrots repeating the proposals of the hypocrites and apostates who use these sammā’īn as a part of the war against Islam … The projects of kufr would never penetrate us except through the sammā’īn, not through the ranks of apostate secularists, the atheist liberals, and their parties…”\n“I will mention some of their traits in this era … but it isn’t necessarily the case that every faction of them has all these traits:”\n“1) They beautify and propagate the principles of the kuffār including nationalism, human rights, and minority rights.  2) They flatter the apostate groups and claim that the mujāhidīn oppress them. 3) They ask that the mujāhidīn and apostates refer to them for arbitration, as if the two sides are equal. 4) They announce their acceptance of the kuffār as leaders for the lands. They cooperate with them, welcome them, and follow their orders. 5) They safeguard and sanctify the borders that the crusaders and descendants of pigs fabricated. 6) They implicitly and explicitly slander the mujāhidīn. They ally with every debased person and apostate party, granting them refuge out of fear that the hands of the mujāhidīn might reach them. 7) They accuse the peo1 Editor’s Note: This is the official slogan of the “Islamic Front” led by “Ahrār ash-Shām.”\n5151\nIN THE WORDS OF THE ENEMY\nple of īmān with extremism and lack of goodness. They give verdicts that it is prohibited to perform jihād with the mujāhidīn. 8) They describe the conceding defeatists as moderates. 9) They declare their loyalty to international law. 10) They ally with the enemies of jihād and those who obtain financial  aid  from  the  people  of  kufr  and  aggression.  11) They seek the support and aid of the kuffār and apostates. 12) They turn a blind eye towards the crimes of the apostates  and  the  kuffār,  whereas  they  dig  for  the  mistakes  of the  good  mujāhidīn.  13)  They  have  blind  eyes,  deaf  ears, and mute tongues towards the kāfir and apostate enemies, whereas they have sharp tongues against the people of īmān and jihād. 14) They throw bad labels at the mujāhidīn. They call them the other face of the Khawārij state and a party of deviance and terror, whereas they are more worthy of the description of deviance and farther from the truth and truthfulness. 15) They declare their barā’ah from Salafī Jihadism. 16)  They  describe  the  mujāhidīn  as  Khawārij,  extremists, and  corrupters.  They  wag  their  tails  in  front  of  the  apostates. 17) They call the tawāghīt ‘wulāt umūr’ [‘the people of authority’]. But this is a lie, misguidance, and falsehood. 18) They prohibit that jihād spreads to all the Muslims and interpret the Ummah to be Syria alone, the Syrian land, the Syrian country! 19) If a kāfir or tāghūt dies, they rush to offer condolences and shed tears over him. They support them in their wars that are not jihād for Allah’s sake. 20) They call the mujāhidīn ‘takfīriyyīn’ because the mujāhidīn pronounce takfīr upon the crusaders, the Jews, the zanādiqah, and the apostates. 21) They welcome cooperation with the kāfir and apostate states. 22) They follow and call for strict regionalism, as if they hold Sykes-Picot to be holy. 23) They call for a state of justice, law, and freedom, because they are embarrassed of Islam.2 24) They strive to guarantee safety for 2 Editor’s Note: He refers to a document released on 18 Rajab 1435 (“17 May 2014”) known as the “Revolutionary Pact of Honor” signed by the “Islamic Front,” “Alwiyat al-Furqān,” “Jaysh al-Mujāhidīn,” “Faylaq ashShām,” and “Al-Ittihād al-Islāmī li Ajnād ash-Shām,” and later endorsed by “Jaysh al-Yarmūk,” all allies of the Jawlānī front.

In  fact,  it  was  characterized  in  contrast to this by a frank, early warning of the consequence  of  deviation  and  opposition  to  the truth.\nallah  ta’ālā  said:  {and  we  had  certainly  sent nūh to his people, [saying], “Indeed, I am to you a clear warner. that you not worship except allah. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a painful day.”} [hūd: 25-26]\nash-shawkānī  (rahimahullāh)  says,  “the  sentence {Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a painful day} is explanatory. It means: ‘I warned you against worshipping other than allah because  I  fear  for  you’. this  sentence  contains  a true  warning.  Furthermore,  the  painful day referred to is the day of Judgment or the day of the flood.”the  word  “or”  in  ash-shawkānī’s  state-\nment  above  undoubtedly  combines  both  items mentioned. this is because the punishment promised  by  nūh  (‘alayhis-salām)  includes  both  the punishment  of  hellfire  on  the  day  of  Judgment, and the punishment of drowning in the flood in this dunyā. as a result, his people were ultimately afflicted by both punishments. allah ta’ālā said: {because of their sins they were drowned and put into the Fire, and they found not for themselves besides allah [any] helpers} [nūh: 25] .\nwhat  gives  the  issue  further  clarity  is  that  when the conflict erupted between nūh and his people, and the day of the flood drew closer, the threat in nūh’s tone towards his people increased. In fact, he  entirely  abandoned  the  tone  of  debate  that they  were  accustomed  to,  especially  after  being informed  through  revelation  that  no  one  else from among his people would believe from that day forward apart from those who had already believed.\nFrom amongst the threats he made to his people is that mentioned in the following statement of allah ta’ālā: {and he constructed the ship, and when-\n\f"

These  grizzly events, as we have seen with the Japanese and Jordanian hostages, are stage managed in order to gain maximum publicity and inspire general terror.”\n“Isis  has  suffered  setbacks,  but  has  also had  successes.  This  week,  its  forces  were finally  driven  out  of  the  Syrian  Kurdish  town of  Kobani  after  a  siege  lasting  134  days,  in which it suffered heavy losses from 606 US air strikes.  But  elsewhere  in  Syria,  Isis  has  been advancing towards the city of Homs as well as gaining strength south of Damascus and at alQalamoun,  close  to  eastern  Lebanon.  By  one account, Isis has won control of territory since last September where one million Syrians live, in addition to the area it already held.”\n“In Iraq, government forces have made advances in  the  provinces  around  Baghdad,  but  earlier this  week  bullets  hit  a  plane  and  wounded passengers over Baghdad International Airport, forcing major airlines to stop flying there. This isolates the Iraqi capital and, though the airport is  not  completely  closed,  Isis  could  probably achieve this at any moment.”\nHe then went on to say:\n“According  to  the  International  Centre  for  the Study  of  Radicalisation  and  Political  Violence, the number of foreign fighters joining Isis in Iraq and Syria has risen from 15,000 last October to 20,000 today. A fifth of these come from Western Europe. Isis has also conscripted fighters in the territories it controls.”\n“Isis is being squeezed militarily and economically, but there is no sign of it imploding. Even its loss of Kobani is not necessarily a sign of weakness, since it held on for months despite fighting … [the] Syrian Kurds, backed by an intensive US air bombardment in a confined place.”\nIN THE WORDS OF THE ENEMY\n“Western  analysts  are  encouraged  by  the number  of  experienced Isis  commanders killed last year, but its ideology is built around martyrdom, and the high casualty rate among leaders  shows  that  they  fight  in  the  frontline. President Obama says America’s main effort is in Iraq but unless it can rebuild the Iraqi army then  it  will  be  near  impossible  to  defeat  Isis there. And so long as Isis continues, so too will high profile hostage-taking and executions.”\nThe  Washington  Post  Editorial  Board  also commented on the “victories” of the coalition, saying:\n“A small victory in Syria is no reason to celebrate as the Islamic State gets stronger. US officials are celebrating a modest victory in the war against the  Islamic  State  in  Syria  –  the  apparently successful  defense  of  the  Kurdish  town  of Kobane, on the border with Turkey. Under siege since early October, Kobane has little strategic value but came to be seen as a test of whether the United States and its allies could stop the expansion of the Islamic State … With the help of  Kurdish  ground  forces,  the  extremists  were turned  back.  But  perhaps  the  most  significant fact about Kobane is that it consumed 75 percent of  the  nearly  1,000  airstrikes  carried  out  by allied planes throughout Syria since September … In the rest of the Syrian territory it controls, including its capital of Raqqa, the Islamic State … is growing stronger rather than weaker.”\nOr in the words of the crusader Eric Shawn of Fox News:\n“The president promises ISIS will be destroyed. Instead, it is only spreading … Coalition forces did  finally  beat  back  ISIS  in  the  key  border town of Kobani … It reportedly took 75 percent of  all  the  air  strikes  launched  there  so  far  to accomplish it. And despite that one glimmer of hope,  the  Islamic  state  vows  to  recapture  the town  as  it  scores  successes  elsewhere  …  The Islamic state’s territory has grown in the last five months … despite all of the coalition air strikes.”\ndabiq\n\fBut the fiery zeal of the broken Muslim Ummah began  to  cool  by  the  hazy  events  known  as “the  Arab  Spring”  as  well  as  the  lack  of  a body  representing  Islam  (the  Khilāfah)  then. The  Muslims  saw  the  same  aforementioned movements,  “scholars,”  callers,  sects,  and even  the  apostate  tawāghīt3    get  involved in  “supporting”  the  cause  of  the  oppressed Muslims  in  Shām.  And  so  confusion  spread, and the withering of the grayzone was slowed or  almost  halted.  Once  again,  the  heretical call  to  the  gates  of  Hellfire  –  the  religions  of the  tawāghīt  –  was  answered  by  many  of  the ignorant.\nThen  came  the  announcement  of  the  Islamic State’s  expansion  to  Shām  followed  by  the subsequent  announcement  of  the  Khilāfah… bringing the grayzone to the brink of permanent extinction…  by  reviving  the  great  body  of Islam and so no Muslim had any excuse to be independent of this entity embodying them and waging war on their behalf in the face of kufr. Now, a stance of “neutrality” or “independence” would doom him4 , as it entailed major sin, which would  cause  him  to  commit  greater  sins  until he could commit kufr for the sake of his sinful interests,  as  the  scholars  stated,  “The  reward for sin is another sin,” and “Sins are the gateway to kufr” [Al-Jawāb al-Kāfī – Ibnul-Qayyim].5\nThe destruction of the grayzone is comparable to  the  division  resulting  from  the  Islamic message  when  it  was  first  conveyed  by  the Messenger  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam).  As the angels said when they appeared before the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) while he was  sleeping,  “Muhammad  is  a  divider”  and “Muhammad  divided  the  people”  [Sahīh  alBukhārī]. For this reason, the mushrikīn would warn the Arabs against the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) by saying, “You have come to our lands. The matter of this man amongst us has grown severe. He has divided our jamā’ah (community)  and  scattered  our  strength.  His words  are  like  that  of  a  sorcerer.  He  divides between a man and his father, a man and his \nTHE EXTINCTION OF THE GRAYZONE\nbrother, a man and his wife. We fear for you and your people what he has brought upon us. So do not speak to him nor listen to a word from him”  [Ibn  Hishām].  They  would  also  say,  “He divides between a man and his religion … a man and his clan” [Ibn Hishām] and “He severed the bonds between us” [Ibn Hishām].\nRasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  came with al-Furqān (the Qur’ān, the divider between truth  and  falsehood)  by  which  he  divided  his people into two opposing parties – the Muslims versus  the  mushrikīn  –  who  then  fought  each other  on  the  Day  of  al-Furqān  (the  Battle  of Badr),  where  Rasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa sallam) slaughtered his mushrik adversaries by his sword.\nAnd  when  a  grayzone  formed  and  a  “masjid” was  established  for  it,  Allah  (ta’ālā)  revealed to His Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) al-Fādihah  (the  Exposer,  Sūrat  at-Tawbah)  by which the grayish were exposed as well as their harmful  “masjid.”  Rasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi wa sallam) went on to demolish this “masjid”… again ridding the Ummah of the destructive gray movement, as the grayzone was the hideout of the  hypocrites,  {Indeed,  the  hypocrites  [think to]  deceive  Allah,  but  He  is  deceiving  them. And  when  they  stand  for  prayer,  they  stand lazily, showing [themselves to] the people and not remembering Allah except a little, wavering between  them,  [belonging]  neither  to  the _____________3   See previous footnote.\n4   Note: After September 11th, the two opposing camps were the divided Ummah versus the crusaders. Now – according to the crusaders themselves – it is the Islamic State versus the crusaders. Accordingly, the grayzone has different implications for both times. In the past, it consisted of the hypocrites, deviant innovators, and abandoners of jihād. After the Khilāfah and the subsequent crusade, the grayzone also encompasses “independent” and “neutral” Islamic parties that refuse to join the Khilāfah, as these parties claim to be independent of both opposing camps.\n5   What the scholars mean is that sins – including bid’ah – will get a person into committing further sins. Each time he commits a sin, Allah will punish him with greater sins. Eventually, Allah could punish him with kufr, like the case of someone who knows that the implementation of the Sharī’ah will prevent him from pursuing his addiction to sin and thus joins the ranks of those who wage war against it, so he can preserve a social and political condition suitable for his sins. Or the case of those whose attachment to innovation and hizbiyyah is so deep that he feels he must wage war against the Khilāfah and so he cooperates with the murtaddīn against it.\ndabiq\n\f"

These operations are merely a selection of the numerous operations that the Islamic State has conducted on various fronts across many regions over the course of the last two months.\nWilāyat  al-Khayr  -  On  Wednesday  the  25th  of  DhulQa’dah, the soldiers of the Khilāfah carried out an assault on  the  forward  defense  position  for  the  missile  battalion base  at  the  Dayr  az-Zawr  military  airbase  and  succeeded in taking control of the position. Two istishhādī operations were  then  carried  out  by  our  brothers  Abū  Ayman  ashShāmī and Abul-Khansā’ al-Himsī using a tank and a BMP rigged with explosives. They targeted two groups of Nusayrī soldiers inside the battalion base, and their attacks were followed by an assault in which the mujāhidīn succeeded in taking complete control of the base and capturing a large quantity  of  ghanīmah.  One  month  later,  the  mujāhidīn would score another major victory in their ongoing efforts to capture the Dayr az-Zawr airbase. In a string of blessed operations, the soldiers of the Khilāfah, by Allah’s grace, succeeded in capturing a number of strategic points in the \nAchieved  shahadah  during the operation that led to the capture of the missile battalion base in al-Khayr\nA Nusayrī soldier shortly before he’s killed\n25\nA SELECTION OF MILITARY OPERATIONS\nvicinity  of  the  airbase,  including  the  Abul-Walīd  farms, Buyūt ad-Dughaym, Dashmat Hamad, and the Zanūbiyā factory next to the entrance to the airbase. This occurred after several days of continuous clashes during the course of which several istishhādī operations were carried out. The soldiers of the Khilāfah continue to besiege the airbase, anticipating its pending liberation, bi idhnillāh.\nWilāyat al-Barakah - On Wednesday the 1st of Dhul-Hijjah, our brother Abū ‘Amr al-Barakah succeeded in breaching PKK security checkpoints in the city of al-Barakah and attacked the murtaddīn’s public relations headquarters located on the outskirts of the Mushayrifah neighborhood. He detonated his explosive vehicle, destroying the headquarters,  killing  nearly  30  murtaddīn,  and  wounding  several others. May Allah accept him amongst the shuhadā’.\nBengal - On Monday the 14th of Dhul-Hijjah, a security cell comprised of the Khilāfah’s soldiers in Bangladesh targeted and killed the Italian crusader Cesare Tavella, following him on one of the streets of the city of Dhaka and shooting him with a silencer. Just five days later, they struck again, targeting Kunio Hoshi, a citizen of Japan, one of the member nations  of  the  crusader  coalition.  He  was  closely  tracked and eliminated in the city of Rangpur using a firearm. Just three weeks later, on the 10th of Muharram, the mujāhidīn detonated a number of IEDs on the Dālān temple in the city of Dhaka as the Rāfidah were conducting their shirkī rituals, killing and wounding nearly 100 of them. Eleven days later, the mujāhidīn assaulted a checkpoint in Dhaka, killing one policeman and wounding another.\nWilāyat  ‘Adan  Abyan  -  On  Tuesday  the  22nd  of  DhulHijjah,  four  istishhādī  operations  targeted  a  gathering  of Saudi, Emirati, and Yemeni officers and pounded the Yemeni government’s headquarters. The first was carried out by our brother Abū Sa’d al-‘Adanī, who detonated his explosive truck at the Palace Hotel, which served as the government’s headquarters.  He  was  followed  by  the  second  istishhādī, Abū  Muhammad  as-Sahlī,  who  detonated  his  explosive Hummer at the same location, killing the murtadd soldiers present there. The third istishhādī attack was carried out by our brother Aws al-‘Adanī targeting the Saudi and Emirati forces’ central operations base. He detonated his explosive \n\fmah in general and to the mujāhidīn in particular is the revival of the Khilāfah, the Muslim body which had been absent  for  several  centuries  since  the  collapse  of  the  ‘Abbāsī Khilāfah. No one realizes this blessing more than one who has experienced the crusader lands of the West, then Shām  tormented  by  the  Baathist  and  Nusayrī  tawāghīt, followed by Shām plundered by the apostates of the Free Syrian Army and its nationalist allies. Yes, the revived Khilāfah is a blessing that no matter how much one attempted and strived to thank Allah for, he would never be able to fulfill the gratitude due upon him. But one has an example in Dāwūd (‘alayhis-salām) who was reported to have said, “My Lord, how can I thank You for Your blessings while I am not able to thank you except by Your blessing?” So Allah revealed to him, “O Dāwūd, do you not know that the blessings you have are from Me?” He replied, “Of course my Lord.” Allah said to him, “I am pleased with such as thankfulness from you” [Reported by Imām Ahmad in “AzZuhd”]. We also have an example in Mūsā n who was reported to have said, “My Lord, how can I thank You while I am not able to compensate the smallest blessing from the blessings You’ve granted me with the total of all my deeds?” So Allah revealed to him, “O Mūsā, now you have thanked Me” [Reported by Imām Ahmad in “Az-Zuhd”].\nYes,  Allah  c  blessed  us  by  reviving  the  Khilāfah  for  us through the soldiers of the Islamic State. He also blessed us by allowing us to thank Him for this great blessing. And none of this was achievable if not for Him alone.\nStrangeness\nStrangeness  is  a  condition  that  the  Muslim  living  in  the West cannot escape as long as he remains amongst the crusaders. He is a stranger amongst Christians and liberals. He is  a  stranger  amongst  fornicators  and  sodomites.  He  is  a \nAllah’s Messenger g said, “Whoever is blessed with a blessing  and  mentions  it,  has  shown  thanks  for  it.  Whoever hides it, has denied it” [Sahīh: Reported by Abū Dāwūd from  Jābir  Ibn  ‘Abdillāh].  Al-Hasan  Ibn  ‘Alī  k  said,  “If you acquire good, then tell your brothers.” ‘Umar Ibn ‘Abdil-‘Azīz r (died 101AH) said, “Mentioning a blessing is thankfulness.”  Abū  Nadrah  r  (died  108AH)  said,  “The Muslims  used  to  consider  that  speaking  about  a  blessing was part of showing thanks for it.” Al-Hasan al-Basrī r (died 110AH) said, “Mention this blessing often, for mentioning a blessing is thankfulness.” Qatādah r (died 118AH) said, “Spreading good news of a blessing is part of showing thanks for it.” Al-Jarīrī r (died 144AH) and Yahyā Ibn Sa’īd r (died 143AH) both said, “It used to be said that counting the blessings was from thankfulness.” Al-Fudayl Ibn ‘Iyād r (died 187AH) said, “It used to be said that talking about a blessing was part of showing thanks for it.” Ibn Abī al-Hawārī said, “Al-Fudayl Ibn ‘Iyād r (died 187AH) and Sufyān Ibn ‘Uyaynah r (died 199AH) sat one night until morning mentioning the blessings. They kept  saying,  ‘Allah  blessed  us  with  such  and  such.  Allah blessed us with such and such.’”1 \nFrom the greatest of blessings granted to the Muslim Um1 These narrations from the Salaf and the scholars were quoted and referenced in the tafsīr of the verse.

See “Ad-Durr al-Manthūr.”\n2929\nAND AS FOR THE BLESSING OF YOUR LORD, THEN MENTION IT\n\fSyrian  elementary  school children being indoctrinated into a system of kufr\napostate tawāghīt governing by manmade laws. In such a scenario, the blessed ones are often those who are able to survive with their īmān intact and a mountain of sins to answer for on the Day of Judgment. But even in the case of those who eventually make the decision to leave such lands and perform hijrah to dārul-Islām after Allah guides them and opens their eyes to the dangerous situation they are in, it’s often too late for their family. For many, the decision to save themselves comes after they’ve already lost their children, some to drugs and promiscuity, and others to kufr, shirk, and even atheism. And it all begins in the schools.\nMany of those who send their children to the schools of the kuffār are “uneducated”1 and thereby unable to teach their children themselves, so they rely on others to teach them. Many others are in financial need, so they don’t have the money to hire a Muslim tutor that can teach  their  children  without  incorporating  un-Islamic \n1 This is a term used to refer exclusively to secular “education.” Many people have been duped into believing that a secular “education” is a “necessity,” so much so that they consider it a child’s essential “right” to waste dozens of years in school to obtain a piece of paper that may ultimately have nothing to do with the profession he later works in! In addition to this, one could memorize the Qur’ān and study the Sunnah with a scholar, but if he – despite all that – hadn’t completed his secular “education,” he would be labeled “uneducated”!\nShortly before making hijrah to Shām a few years ago from the crusader nation in which I’d been raised, my mother mentioned to me that she had recently spoken to a family friend from back home who asked her about our condition and the condition of other families from the same country who were living in the West. She told me that she claimed we were all doing well – and in the Dunyā sense we were in fact doing fairly well – when in reality, as my mother said, “Every family that comes here suffers one calamity or another with respect to their children.” What she was referring to, as she went on to clarify, were the countless Muslim youth in the West who get themselves tangled into drugs, alcohol, gangs, promiscuity, and other vices and social illnesses over which any decent Muslim family would weep for its children.\nAnd  yet  as  terrible  as  these  vices  may  be,  the  fact  remains that many still downplay the severity of kufr in comparison with other sins. This is not to water down the issue of committing sins but for the sake of perspective I need to make it clear that this is addressed to Muslims who are risking their entire Hereafter by continuing to live under the authority of the crusaders waging war against Islam or in lands ruled by \n3333\nO YOU WHO HAVE BELIEVED, PROTECT YOURSELVES AND YOUR FAMILIES FROM FIRE\n\f"

So the Mother of the Believers, Umm Salamah   asked  the  Prophet  ,  according  to  the  hadīth  of Mujāhid, “O Messenger of Allah, the men go out to battle and we do not go out to battle…” So Allah  revealed: {And do not wish for that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others} [An-Nisā’: 32], as reported by atTirmidhī and others.\nStill, the absence of an obligation of jihād and war upon the Muslim woman – except in defense against someone attacking her – does not overturn her role in building the Ummah, producing men, and sending them out to the fierceness of battle.\nTherefore, I write this article for my Muslim sister, the wife of a mujāhid and the mother of lion cubs.\nAllah   said, {But among them is he who says, “Our Lord, give us good in this dunyā and good in the Hereafter and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.” Those will have a share of what they have earned, and Allah is swift in account} [Al-Baqarah: 201-202].\nAccording to ‘Alī Ibn Abī Tālib , {good in this dunyā} refers to “the righteous wife” [Zād al-Masīr].\nThawbān  said,  “When  the  revelation  concerning  silver and gold came down, they said, ‘So what wealth should we seek to possess?’ ‘Umar said, ‘I will find out for you.’ He then rode quickly on a camel and reached him while I was on his heels. So he said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what wealth should we seek to possess?’ He said, ‘Let one of you possess a thankful heart, a tongue that remembers Allah,  and  a  wife  that  helps  him  in  the  matter  of  the Hereafter’” [Hasan: Reported by Imām Ahmad and Ibn Mājah].\nMay  my  father,  mother,  and  myself  be  sacrificed  in defense  of  Allah’s  Messenger,  who  was  bestowed  with comprehensive  speech:  “A  wife  that  helps  him  in  the matter  of  the  Hereafter,”  the  Hereafter,  the  important matter,  the  ultimate  goal,  and  the  concern  of  the intelligent,  discerning  believer.  How  eloquent  is  the statement of the woman who said to her spouse when she saw him worried one day, “Why are you sad? Is it because of the Dunyā, then Allah has finished decreeing it. Or is it because of the Hereafter? In which case may Allah increase you in worry!”\nAnd you, O sister in Islam, O wife of a mujāhid, your \nhusband  is  one  whom  the  world  today  agreed  upon waging  war  against.  My  sister,  do  you  know  who  the mujāhid is? A man who turned his back on the Dunyā and  went  out  seeking  his  death  so  that  the  Ummah may live. And I think that on the day he came forward to marry you, if he was not a mujāhid then, he was a mujāhid in the making. At the very least, you were aware of his methodology and creed, and you knew what type of life he sought to live. And if he was a deviant sitting back from jihād at the time, he has repented to Allah, and Allah is more joyed by the repentance of His slave than  a  man  who  wakes  up  and  finds  his  camel  next to him after losing it in the desert! So why do we find some of the mujāhidīn’s wives complaining about their lives? If she hears of an imminent battle that he will be in, she gets angry. If she sees him putting on war armor, she gets upset. If he goes out for ribāt, she gets in a bad mood.  If  he  returns  late,  she  complains.  O  my  sister, who deluded you and told you that the life of jihād is one of comfort and ease? Do you not love jihād and its people? Please listen. Indeed you are in jihād when you await the return of your husband patiently, anticipating Allah’s reward, and making du’ā’ for him and those with him to attain victory and consolidation. You are in jihād when you uphold your loyalty to him in his absence. You are in jihād when you teach his children the difference between  the  truth  and  falsehood,  between  right  and wrong. Indeed, you, my precious sister, are today the wife of a mujāhid, and tomorrow you might be the wife of a shahīd, or an injured fighter, or a prisoner – so how ready is your supply of patience and steadfastness? If you are discontent and complain in times of ease and comfort, how will you be in times of hardship and affliction?! Will you be patient if he returns to you being carried with his blood pouring, or do you want your husband only when he is well?\nIbn Kathīr  said, “The scholars of tafsīr and history, as well as others, said that Ayyūb  was a wealthy man who possessed many different types of wealth, including livestock,  slaves,  cattle,  and  ample  land  in  the  region of al-Buthaynah in the land of Hūrān. And Ibn ‘Asākir narrated that all of it belonged to him and that he had sons and many relatives. Then he was bereaved of these things altogether and his body was afflicted with various illnesses and no healthy organ remained in him except for his heart and his tongue, with which he remembered Allah  b,  and  throughout  all  that  he  was  patient, anticipating reward from Allah and remembering Allah b day and night. His illness was so long, that even his friends and companions deserted him. He was expelled from his land and cast onto a garbage heap outside of it. The people cut ties with him and none remained having \ndabiq\n\fCrusader airstrikes on Iraq in “2003”\nas “whoever imitates a people is from them” [Reported by Imām Ahmad and Abū Dāwūd from Ibn ‘Umar] and so that {the way of the criminals will become evident} [Al-An’ām: 55].\nThe Crusader Coalition\nAlthough this coalition might appear new, it manifested in “2001” in what was known as “Operation Enduring Freedom.”  It  quickly  expanded  to  the  Philippines,  the Horn  of  Africa,  the  Trans  Sahara,  and  the  Caucasus. In  “2003,”  the  crusaders  then  launched  a  second campaign  known  as  “Operation  Iraqi  Freedom.”  This was followed by a third campaign known as “Operation Inherent Resolve” launched in “2014” in both Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State.2  None of these various campaigns were successful in preventing the revival of the Khilāfah nor its continuity nor its expansion. Rather it was the Khilāfah that endured with inherent resolve, a result of its tawhīd and walā’ and barā’.\nThe  new  crusader  coalition  for  Iraq  and  Syria  – “Operation  Inherent  Resolve”  –  officially  includes  the following countries and entities: \nAlbania,  the  Arab  League,  Australia,  Austria,  Bahrain, Belgium,  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina,  Bulgaria,  Canada, Croatia,  Cyprus,  Czech  Republic,  Denmark,  Egypt, Estonia, the European Union, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany,  Greece,  Hungary,  Iceland,  Iraq,  Ireland, Italy,  Japan,  Jordan,  Kosovo,  Kuwait,  Latvia,  Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxembourg,  Macedonia,  Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, The Netherlands, New Zealand, \n2 Note: The various campaign names are those given to the operation by the Americans.

        "@value": "the pro-democracy “Islamist” parties who refer legislation to several dozen or  several  hundred  elected  officials (“legislators”) and between the pagan Hindus who direct worship to countless idols. Yet, out of Allah’s mercy, He did  not  impose  upon  our  Ummah such a difficult act of atonement for shirk  as  He  did  for  Banī  Isrā’īl,  but instead only requires that those who fall into shirk abandon the act of shirk they committed and repent sincerely.Furthermore, by stating that only a  few  of  the  hypocrites  would  obey Him if He were to command them to kill themselves or to perform hijrah, Allah  is  exposing  the  nature  of  the hypocrites who merely pay lip service to the religion without actually having obedience to their Lord. As such, if  they  were  to  be  faced  with  commands that entail a tremendous level of difficulty and sacrifice, they would make  excuses  for  themselves  rather than follow the clear revelation. This reinforces the point that the true slave of Allah is one who neither questions the  wisdom  in  His  commands  nor hesitates to carry them out, regardless of how difficult they may appear. It’s important to note that many of those who  claim  to  follow  Allah  and  His Messenger find it difficult to perform deeds – whether hijrah or otherwise –  purely  out  of  obedience  to  Allah and His Messenger. They claim that they must know the wisdom related to the deed – and undoubtedly there is wisdom in all Allah’s decrees – but if they can’t see it, or if they believe that  this  wisdom  no  longer  applies to the modern era or to their society, they neglect the deed, discourage and mock those who perform it, and even wage  war  against  the  Book  of  Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, all the while still claiming to be Muslims!Those who do this are of varying levels. There are those who are more blatant  in  this  regard  and  have  no shame in declaring that the Sharī’ah is  “barbaric,”  or  is  inapplicable  in our  times,  and  there  are  those  who are  more  discreet,  including  many \nwho reside in the lands of kufr, refuse to perform hijrah, and make all manner of excuses in order to avoid such a lofty obligation. This, however,  is  not  surprising  when one considers that the sacrifice and difficulty entailed in making hijrah is so great that Allah c mentioned it  in  the  above  āyah  alongside the order to kill oneself! Even the Prophets p were not exempt from the  difficulty  involved  in  making hijrah, including the best of mankind g, who made hijrah to a city whose  population  included  some treacherous  Jews  and  hypocrites and  was  surrounded  by  hostile Bedouin  tribes  after  first  leaving the protection of his own tribe and relatives, facing an assassination attempt, and seeking shelter in a cave for a number of days. Performing hijrah is often a serious test of one’s īmān and tawakkul, and as such, it requires a believer to prepare himself by ensuring that he is ready to carry out the commands of Allah with nothing more than a simple order,  even  if  he  doesn’t  understand  the  whole  wisdom  behind it. Allah c says, {But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not} [Al-Baqarah: 216].\nnarration \nAlso,  one  can  take  from  the aforementioned of Thābit  Ibn  Qays  that  a  believer must  demonstrate  confidence  in his  willingness  to  obey  Allah  and His  Messenger  in  the  most  difficult  of  circumstances  and  not second-guess  himself,  even  when facing  a  hypothetical  scenario. Doing so does not constitute tazkiyat (self-promotion) when accompanied with a correct intention, such as for the purpose of  displaying  honor  and  strength in front of the kuffār, as was done by Thābit h in front of the Jew, or for the purpose of inciting oneself towards the obedience of Allah \nan-nafs \nand His Messenger, and this is of even greater significance, for in the aforementioned āyāt, Allah c says, {And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger – those will be with the ones  upon  whom  Allah  has  bestowed favor} [An-Nisā’: 69], and in  the  āyāt  preceding  this,  Allah c says, {And We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by permission  of  Allah}  [An-Nisā’: 64]. So the believer must be conscious of his level of obedience to Allah and His Messenger, and incite  himself  in  that  regard.\nConcerning  the  words  of  Allah,  {But  if  they  had  done  what they were instructed, it would have been better for them and a firmer position [for them in faith]} [AnNisā’: 66], at-Tabarī mentions that as-Suddī  explained  “a  firmer  position” to mean “a stronger tasdīq (affirmation  of  the  truth).”  This is appropriate, for indeed one can affirm the truth of Islam with his words, but if this is not backed by lofty deeds such as hijrah then it is often  merely  lip  service,  as  mentioned earlier concerning the hypocrites. As such, Allah is teaching us  that  by  performing  the  deeds we’ve been instructed to do – particularly the difficult ones that require  a  greater  level  of  obedience and  sacrifice  –  the  Muslim  lends more strength to his claim that he is a believer. As a result, Allah c grants him two tremendous favors, as  mentioned  in  the  two  subsequent āyāt: {And then We would have given them from Us a great reward. And We would have guided  them  to  a  straight  path}  [AnNisā’:  67-68].\nMay  Allah  make  us \nfrom among those who do not shy away from  performing  difficult  deeds that  bring  us  guidance  and  adherence to the straight path in the Dunyā  followed  by  tremendous rewards  in  the  Hereafter.\n19\flonel  Mashkūr  al-Jughayfī, in addition to one of the leaders of the  sahwah  groups.

It also becomes easier for him to tie events narrated in the Sunnah and Sīrah of the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  with  events  today.  He then  knows  why  the  Prophet  (sallallāhu ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  treated  the  Arab  and Israelite tribes as collective wholes whenever tribe members broke their covenants with him. This is also how after him, Abū Bakr as-Siddīq (radiyallāhu ‘anh) dealt with the tribes during the wars of apostasy. In the prophetic and siddīqī methodology, the tribes of the era were considered homogenous parties; unique individuals were treated as exceptional cases, not as the general rule. The fuqahā’ call these homogenous, collective  wholes  “tawā’if  mumtani’ah,”  if they resist the Sharī’ah. By definition, if the tribe does not act as a group in opposing the Sharī’ah, it would be obviously wrong to apply this ruling to its members.\nAfter this discussion, it should become clear why the Islamic State dealt with the clans of  Shu’aytāt  as  a  murtadd  party  resisting the  Sharī’ah  with  arms.  These  clans  were left armed after they agreed to submit to the rule of the Sharī’ah with the condition they hand over all heavy weaponry. They then betrayed their covenant by rebelling against the Islamic State. They ambushed Islamic  State  soldiers,  and  then  tortured, amputated, and executed prisoners taken from the ambushes. All these crimes were carried  out  in  opposition  to  the  enforcement of the Sharī’ah.\nThereafter  the  Islamic  State  surrounded  their  villages  and  ordered  them  to hand over the perpetuators of the crimes against  Islam  and  the  Muslims.  The  majority of their clans refused to comply, and \nshu’aytāt PRisONER s\nshu’aytāt PRisONER s\neXecUtiOn OF shu’aytāt tRaitORs\ndabiq\fslaughter any cow. They asked these questions only to evade responsibility; and when they finally obeyed, they did so reluctantly. {So they slaughtered  it  [the  cow], and  yet  they  nearly  did not} [Al-Baqarah: 71].\nTherefore,  every  Muslim professional  who  delayed his jihād in the past under the  pretense  of  studying Sharī’ah, medicine, or engineering,  etc.,  claiming he  would  contribute  to Islam later with his expertise, should now make his number one priority to repent  and  answer  the  call to  hijrah,  especially  after the  establishment  of  the Khilāfah.  This  Khilāfah  is more  in  need  than  ever before for experts, professionals, and specialists, who can help contribute in strengthening \nits structure and tending to the needs of their Muslim brothers. Otherwise, his claims will become a greater proof against him on Judgment \nDay. \nAs  for  the  Muslim students  who  use this  same  pretense now to  continue abandoning the obligation  of  the  era, then  they  should know  that  their  hijrah  from  dārul-kufr to  dārul-Islām and  jihād  are  more obligatory  and  urgent then spending an  unknown  number  of  years  studying  while  exposed to  doubts  and  desires  that  will  destroy  their  religion  and  thus end for themselves any possible future of jihād.\nTHe Fear oF Hypocrisy\nparT 2:\nAbū Hurayrah (radiyallāhu ‘anh) said that Allah’s Messenger  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  said, “Whoever  dies  without  taking  part  in  a  battle and  without  intending  to  take  part  in  a  battle, has died with a trait of hypocrisy” [Sahīh Muslim]. Therefore, abandoning jihād is a trait of hypocrisy. So be wary of it or else it may seize you by your heart.\nAl-Hasan  al-Basrī  (rahimahullāh)  said,  “No  one fears  hypocrisy  except  a  believer,  and  no  one feels safe from it except a hypocrite” [Jāmi’ al-‘Ulūm wal-Hikam].\nIbn  Rajab  (rahimahullāh)  said,  “Sahl  at-Tustarī said, ‘The murīd (devout worshipper) fears being afflicted with sins, but the ‘ārif (knowledgeable  slave)  fears  being  afflicted  with  kufr.’  For this reason the Sahābah and the righteous Salaf after them were afraid of nifāq (hypocrisy) for themselves,  and  their  worry  of  nifāq  was  severe. Therefore, the believer is afraid of minor nifāq for himself, and he is afraid that such could overcome him prior to death and thus drive him into major nifāq, as we mentioned before that deeply  hidden  evils  bring  about  sinful  death” [Jāmi’ al-‘Ulūm wal-Hikam].\ndabiq\f"

The  Muslims  saw  the  same  aforementioned movements,  “scholars,”  callers,  sects,  and even  the  apostate  tawāghīt3    get  involved in  “supporting”  the  cause  of  the  oppressed Muslims  in  Shām.  And  so  confusion  spread, and the withering of the grayzone was slowed or  almost  halted.  Once  again,  the  heretical call  to  the  gates  of  Hellfire  –  the  religions  of the  tawāghīt  –  was  answered  by  many  of  the ignorant.\nThen  came  the  announcement  of  the  Islamic State’s  expansion  to  Shām  followed  by  the subsequent  announcement  of  the  Khilāfah… bringing the grayzone to the brink of permanent extinction…  by  reviving  the  great  body  of Islam and so no Muslim had any excuse to be independent of this entity embodying them and waging war on their behalf in the face of kufr. Now, a stance of “neutrality” or “independence” would doom him4 , as it entailed major sin, which would  cause  him  to  commit  greater  sins  until he could commit kufr for the sake of his sinful interests,  as  the  scholars  stated,  “The  reward for sin is another sin,” and “Sins are the gateway to kufr” [Al-Jawāb al-Kāfī – Ibnul-Qayyim].5\nThe destruction of the grayzone is comparable to  the  division  resulting  from  the  Islamic message  when  it  was  first  conveyed  by  the Messenger  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam).  As the angels said when they appeared before the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) while he was  sleeping,  “Muhammad  is  a  divider”  and “Muhammad  divided  the  people”  [Sahīh  alBukhārī]. For this reason, the mushrikīn would warn the Arabs against the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) by saying, “You have come to our lands. The matter of this man amongst us has grown severe. He has divided our jamā’ah (community)  and  scattered  our  strength.  His words  are  like  that  of  a  sorcerer.  He  divides between a man and his father, a man and his \nTHE EXTINCTION OF THE GRAYZONE\nbrother, a man and his wife. We fear for you and your people what he has brought upon us. So do not speak to him nor listen to a word from him”  [Ibn  Hishām].  They  would  also  say,  “He divides between a man and his religion … a man and his clan” [Ibn Hishām] and “He severed the bonds between us” [Ibn Hishām].\nRasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  came with al-Furqān (the Qur’ān, the divider between truth  and  falsehood)  by  which  he  divided  his people into two opposing parties – the Muslims versus  the  mushrikīn  –  who  then  fought  each other  on  the  Day  of  al-Furqān  (the  Battle  of Badr),  where  Rasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa sallam) slaughtered his mushrik adversaries by his sword.\nAnd  when  a  grayzone  formed  and  a  “masjid” was  established  for  it,  Allah  (ta’ālā)  revealed to His Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) al-Fādihah  (the  Exposer,  Sūrat  at-Tawbah)  by which the grayish were exposed as well as their harmful  “masjid.”  Rasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi wa sallam) went on to demolish this “masjid”… again ridding the Ummah of the destructive gray movement, as the grayzone was the hideout of the  hypocrites,  {Indeed,  the  hypocrites  [think to]  deceive  Allah,  but  He  is  deceiving  them. And  when  they  stand  for  prayer,  they  stand lazily, showing [themselves to] the people and not remembering Allah except a little, wavering between  them,  [belonging]  neither  to  the _____________3   See previous footnote.\n4   Note: After September 11th, the two opposing camps were the divided Ummah versus the crusaders. Now – according to the crusaders themselves – it is the Islamic State versus the crusaders. Accordingly, the grayzone has different implications for both times. In the past, it consisted of the hypocrites, deviant innovators, and abandoners of jihād. After the Khilāfah and the subsequent crusade, the grayzone also encompasses “independent” and “neutral” Islamic parties that refuse to join the Khilāfah, as these parties claim to be independent of both opposing camps.\n5   What the scholars mean is that sins – including bid’ah – will get a person into committing further sins. Each time he commits a sin, Allah will punish him with greater sins. Eventually, Allah could punish him with kufr, like the case of someone who knows that the implementation of the Sharī’ah will prevent him from pursuing his addiction to sin and thus joins the ranks of those who wage war against it, so he can preserve a social and political condition suitable for his sins. Or the case of those whose attachment to innovation and hizbiyyah is so deep that he feels he must wage war against the Khilāfah and so he cooperates with the murtaddīn against it.\ndabiq\n\fHIS ENJOINING OF GOOD AND FORBIDDING OF EVIL\n{And  let  there  be  [arising]  from  you  a  nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and those will be the successful} [Āl ‘Imrān: 104].\nIn  his  home,  amongst  his  family,  with  the Muslims,  on  the  street,  if  he  saw  an  evil,  he would not leave it be, rather – with wisdom and humility – he would enjoin good and forbid evil.\nHIS DA’WAH\n{And  who  is  better  in  speech  than  one  who invites  to  Allah  and  does  righteousness  and says, “Indeed, I am of the Muslims”} [41:33].\nHe called many people to Allah, especially when he was in prison. He met a man in prison who was  originally  Muslim  but  hated  the  religion and everything related to the religion, to the point  that  this  man  prevented  his  wife  from wearing  hijāb  and  would  prevent  his  brother back  home  from  learning  Arabic.  In  prison, this man met the brother Abū Basīr and stayed with him for 2-3 months. After this period, he would pray all the prayers during their proper time, pray qiyāmul-layl every night, and recite the Qu’rān daily. He ordered his wife to wear hijāb and ordered her to sell the house that he had  purchased  with  a  usurious  loan  so  as  to get out of harām. This story is a story from the dozens  of  unexaggerated  stories.  Those  who met the brother Abū Basīr will weep over his shahādah. He would also call the people whom he  trusted  to  carry  out  the  order  of  Allah  by pledging  allegiance  to  Amīrul-Mu’minīn  Abū Bakr al-Baghdādī.\nHIS DHIKR\nYahyā  (‘alayhis-salām)  said,  “I  order  you  with much dhikr of Allah. A parable of this is a man whom the enemy pursues, following his tracks \nTHE GOOD EXAMPLE OF ABŪ BASĪR AL-IFRĪQĪ\nuntil  the  man  comes  to  a  fortified  fortress and  finds  shelter  there.  Similar  to  this  is  the condition  of  the  slave,  he  is  not  saved  from Shaytān except by dhikr” [Sahīh: Reported by at-Tirmidhī and others].\nHe would not leave the morning and evening dhikr, whether he was in the car, at home, or anywhere else. He would recite Qur’ān much. The  best  dhikr  is  the  recitation  of  His  words (subhānah)  –  the  words  He  revealed  to  His Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam),  as  in the  hadīth,  “You  do  not  return  to  Allah  with something  better  than  what  left  from  Him” [Sahīh: Reported by al-Hākim].\nHIS FOLLOWING OF THE EVIDENCE\n{Follow, [O mankind], what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other than Him any allies. Little do you remember} [Al-A’rāf: 7].\nThe  brother  would  not  accept  any  matter without  evidence.  He  would  himself  strive to verify any matter regardless of the person addressing  it.  If  the  proof  came  to  him,  he \ndabiq\n\f"

The  Carnegie Endowment  wrote  on  “20  April  2015,”  “The Islamic  State  seeks  to  infiltrate  Jordan  in  many ways. Its most effective way of establishing itself is not by attacking across the border, but by coopting Jordanian  extremist  factions  and  exploiting  the simmering  social  discontent  among  Jordanian youth. To  counter  these  trends,  the  government has sought to exploit divisions between al-Qaeda and  the  Islamic  State,  releasing  some  clerics  [alMaqdisī and al-Filistīnī] aligned with the former group  and  allowing  them  a  degree  of  media visibility.”\nThis  policy  was  even  suggested  for  Afghanistan and  Pakistan,  as  the  Islamic  State’s  presence there threatened regional stability. The crusaders of War on the Rocks wrote on “13 April 2015,” “This much is clear, however: Mullah Omar still matters  –  especially  in  South  Asia,  where  two important  developments  are  playing  out.  Both are directly tied to stability, which is Washington’s chief  interest  in  the  region.  And  regardless  of his  fate,  Mullah  Omar  will  have  an  impact  on each  of  them.  Development  number  one  is  the deepening influence of the Islamic State in South Asia. … The second key trend is Kabul’s pursuit \ndabiq\nThe Carnegie Endowment - A major crusader think-tank\npragmatism.  The  group  has  been  collaborating with  a  wide  variety  of  local  forces  that  are  not pushed to fight under its umbrella. Instead, they fight  with  Nusra  as  allies  –  a  radical  departure from the Islamic State’s model, which does not tolerate collaboration unless absolutely necessary. This  approach  has  enabled  the  Nusra  Front  to widen its network of support quickly, including the addition of some Free Syrian Army brigades in Aleppo, Hama, and Daraa.”\nThis description of the Jawlānī front was mirrored in another piece written by the crusaders of Middle East Eye on “30 April 2015.” After describing the “pragmatism”  of  the  Jawlānī  front  (cooperation with  everyone  and  non-implementation  of  the hudūd),  the  author  said,  “Nusra  could  also benefit  from  US  airstrikes  against  IS.  The  US listed the Nusra Front a terrorist organisation in December  2012,  long  before  the  emergence  of IS, but since last year the US-led intervention in Syria and Iraq has largely focused on the aim of degrading and ‘ultimately destroying’ IS. While coalition  airstrikes  have  also  targeted  Nusra positions, the group is less of a priority for the US-led campaign.”\n\fThe apostate leader of Hamas, Ismā’īl Haniyyah, with his ally Khamenei, leader of the Rāfidah\nDābiq: When did the siege begin on the Yarmūk Camp and how did it affect the people of the camp?\nYarmūk: All praise belongs to Allah, the Strong, the  Exalted.  May  blessings  and  peace  be  upon the  cheerful  warrior  and  upon  his  companions and family. As to what follows: O Allah, there is nothing easy except what You made easy and You make  sadness  easy  if  You  will.  O  Allah  bestow us with shahādah for Your cause purely for Your noble face.\nIn reality, the total siege of South Dimashq began four years ago. An exception to that siege was the Yarmūk  Camp.  The  regime  conspired  with  Free Syrian  Army  leaders  in  the  region  to  keep  the camp open in order to empty the huge storehouses found in the district of ‘Aqrabā and Bayt Sahm. These areas were stores for the regime in which it would store staple food supplies like sugar, rice, bulgur, and so on, and it would use the Yarmūk Camp  as  a  passage  to  move  these  food  supplies out of the storehouses.\nThe  regime  worked  according  to  this  evil  plan for about a year, until it was sure the storehouses \nand huge factories were completely emptied and nothing  remained  in  the  area  except  for  scarce quantities sufficing the Muslims for a month or two. The work was completed under the gaze of Aknāf  Bayt  al-Maqdis  and  they  were  the  ones supervising the only passage into the camp. The passage was closed on 15 Ramadān 1433, and it was at that time that hunger started assaulting the Muslims’ bodies and death started reaping their souls until more than 170 people died due to lack of supplies and hunger.\nDābiq: What is the relationship between Aknāf Bayt  al-Maqdis  and  Hamas?  Did  Hamas  take part  militarily,  operationally,  politically,  or through  propaganda,  in  the  war  against  the Islamic State?\nYarmūk: Aknāf Bayt al-Maqdis is Hamas’ branch in  South  Dimashq.  This  faction  was  established during the beginning of the events in Shām for a fundamental aim, which was the creation of an internal  force  considered  “revolutionaries”  who at the same time act as guards defending regimecontrolled  Dimashq;  and  Aknāf  succeeded  in this  task.

At the time, the mujahidin were preparing for a major operation in Hamah, so the two brothers headed out along with the rest of their battalion, leaving their base in ‘Anadan in the Aleppo countryside and remaining stationed in Hamah in preparation for the operation. They had to exercise patience during this period as they awaited their opportunity to  fight  and  attain  martyrdom.  For  Abu  ‘Abdillah, however, that opportunity would be delayed as he and a number of other mujahidin in their battalion were sent back to ‘Anadan to guard their base, look after the families of the mujahidin who were in Hamah, and receive any new muhajirin joining the battalion. He  gracefully  accepted  this  decision  and  reminded the brothers with him that Allah was testing their patience and that soon their opportunity to fight would come. What helped keep him firm then as well as in the  face  of  many  other  difficult  circumstances  was that  Abu  ‘Abdillah  would  regularly  recall  there  was wisdom behind Allah’s decrees.\nAs such, he remained patient even though his op-\nportunity  to  perform  ribat  (frontier  guarding)  and take part in battles against the enemies of Allah would come  much  later  due  to  his  medical  condition.  He had a blood disorder, which made it difficult for him to take part in any activities that could lead to strenuous or stressful circumstances. However, just as his brother had refused to let his asthma get in the way of fighting for the cause of Allah, so too did Abu ‘Abdillah refuse to let his condition prevent him from doing the same. They had both struggled to perform hijrah despite their conditions, and were not about to give up after reaching the point they had come to. Thus, Abu Ibrahim performed ribat and also took part in a number of battles, both in Aleppo and Hamah, and Abu ‘Abdillah waited patiently until his opportunity to perform ribat and fight finally came a few months after the start of the Sahwah in the Levant. During this period of waiting and preparation, Abu ‘Abdillah would contribute to the efforts of the mujahidin by taking on other roles.\nHis brother, having taken part in the operation in Hamah, later headed out with a group of mujahidin to join the effort to capture the city of Safirah in the Aleppo countryside from the Nusayri regime shortly before the start of the Sahwah in the Levant. He took part in a battle in the village of Tall Hasil located near Safirah and was quick to volunteer when the commander asked for a group of brothers to infiltrate \n\fChristians and to destroy that vile race from the lands of  our  friends.”  This  launched  the  Crusades,  which continue today. Popes thereafter, for centuries, overtly and loudly professed their goal of eradicating Islam through war and conversion, as the 15th century Pope Callixtus III made a vow “to extirpate the diabolical sect of the reprobate and faithless Mahomet [Islam] in the East;” and as his predecessor Eugene IV expressed his hope that “very many from the abominable sect of Mahomet will be converted to the Catholic faith” (Council of Basel in 1434).\nAs the war between Islam and the pagan Church raged, and for fear of losing their own followers to Islam, some on the Christian side began speaking more directly about their enemy and the real Islamic goal to destroy their manmade systems and perverted “freedoms.” Benedict XVI – the predecessor of Francis – explained, for example, that democracy “contradicts the essence of Islam, which simply does not have the separation of the political and the religious sphere that Christianity has had from the beginning” (Truth and Tolerance). Despite being a liar, he certainly spoke the truth on this issue – democracy undoubtedly contradicts the essence of Islam – showing thereby that the apostates from Islam, like many of the “imams” in the West and teachers at so-called “Islamic” universities, have less of an understanding of Islam than Benedict the Disbeliever has.\nSome time later, Benedict would again attempt to disparage Islam by mocking the Prophet Muhammad g, but for something the Prophet shared with most of  the  prophets  of  the  Torah,  the  Psalms,  and  the Gospel, which was the order to spread the religion by the  sword.1  Benedict  thus  belittled  the  order  found in the Old and New Testaments for war against the pagans upon quoting the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, who had said, “Show me just what Mohammed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.” The religion of Islam will continue to be spread by the sword, even if Benedict despises such. May Allah expose  Benedict’s  evil  and  inhumanity  and  uncover for the world the true reason behind his scandalous resignation from the pagan Papacy.\nDespite the clarity of past and perished popes re-\n1  To read biblical texts on the obligation of spreading the religion via the sword, see “By the Sword” on pages 78-80 of this issue.\nBenedict XVI, Pope Francis’ predecessor\ngarding their enmity for Islam and its teachings, the current pope, Francis, has struggled against reality to advertise the apostate’s perversion of Islamic teachings as the actual religion of Muslims. So while Benedict and many before him emphasized the enmity between the  pagan  Christians  and  monotheistic  Muslims, Francis’ work is notably more subtle, steering clear of confrontational words that would offend those who falsely claim Islam, those apostates whom the Crusaders found played the perfect role for their infiltration into Muslim lands. While Benedict XVI met public disapproval for quoting a centuries-old Byzantine emperor,  Francis  continues  to  hide  behind  a  deceptive veil of “good will,” covering his actual intentions of pacifying the Muslim nation. This is exemplified in Francis’ statement that “our respect for true followers of Islam should lead us to avoid hateful generalizations, for authentic Islam and the proper reading of the Quran are opposed to every form of violence” (The Joy of the Gospel).\nPart of this approach to subdue Muslims through appeasement  involves  coordinating  with  the  infamous Ash’ari Sufi institute, al-Azhar University, falsely attributed to being representative of Sunni Muslims worldwide. This method is an attempt to justify deviating claims that the Muslim nation has no central authority – as in a caliphate – but is rather “managed” in some way by scholars at universities. Adnane Mokrani, a Tunisian slave to the Catholic Church, commented on Francis’ embracing of Ahmed el-Tayeb – the leader of Cairo’s al-Azhar University – saying, “Islam is not like the Catholic Church. There is no single, central \n\f"

So everyone  who  lives  amongst  the  mushrikīn while being able to perform hijrah and not being able to establish his religion, then he is wronging himself and committing sin. This is in accordance with  ijmā’.  Abū  Dāwūd  reported  through  his isnād on the authority of Samurah Ibn Jundub (radiyallāhu ‘anhumā) that Rasūlullāh (sallallāhu ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  said,  ‘Whoever  gathers  and lives with the mushrik, then he is like him.’”\nAlso, if there were no evidences for the obligation of  hijrah  except  the  following  ahādīth  of  the Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam),  “Hijrah will  not  cease  as  long  as  there  is  repentance, and  repentance  will  not  cease  until  the  sun rises from the West” [Reported by Abū Dāwūd], “Hijrah will not cease as long as there is jihād” [Reported by Imām Ahmad], “I have nothing to do  with  any  Muslim  who  resides  amongst  the mushrikīn”  [Reported  by  Abū  Dāwūd  and  atTirmidhī], and, “Hijrah will not cease as long as the enemy is fought” [Reported by Imām Ahmad and an-Nasā’ī], it would suffice us to refute the doubts of the doubters and the rumors of the fearmongers.\nTHE TWIN HALVES OF THE MUHĀJIRĪN\nThis ruling is an obligation upon women just as  it  is  upon  men,  for  Allah  (ta’ālā),  when excluding those incapable of performing hijrah, He excluded the incapable women just as He excluded  the  incapable  men.  Allah  (ta’ālā) said,  {Except  for  the  oppressed  among  men, women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to a way – for those it is expected that Allah will pardon them, and Allah  is  ever  Pardoning  and  Forgiving}  [AnNisā’:  98-99].  The  Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi wa sallam) has also said, “Women are the twin halves of men” [Reported by Abū Dāwūd, atTirmidhī, and Ibn Mājah].\nAnd  today,  after  the  Muslims  established  a state that rules by the Qur’ān and the Sunnah of  the  Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam), which expanded to wide territories larger than the areas of some of the states of Sykes and Picot,  and  whose  blessed  soldiers  restored the  promised  khilāfah  by  the  edge  of  the sword not through pacifism, the rate of hijrah magnified  and  now  every  day  there  are  not only  muhājirīn  to  the  land  of  Islam  but  also muhājirāt  who  were  sick  of  living  amongst kufr and its people. As soon as the sun of their awaited  state  rose,  they  rushed  to  it  alone and  in  groups  from  the  eastern and  western extents of the Earth. Their colors and tongues are different, but their hearts are united upon “there is no god but Allah.” I remember the day I performed hijrah, I was the only Arab woman amongst the muhājirah sisters during that trip.\nIf  speaking  about  the  muhājirīn  is  amazing, then  speaking  about  their  twin  halves  the muhājirāt  is  even  more  amazing!  How  many stories  have  I  heard  which  I  would  not  have believed if not for hearing them directly from the mouths of those sisters involved or seeing these  sisters  with  my  own  eyes;  otherwise, I  would  have  thought  them  the  product  of imagination or something impossible!\nThe  opponents  often  repeat  that  those  who perform hijrah to the Islamic State belong to \ndabiq\n\fBecause much of what has befallen the Ummah is due to this deviant innovation, it is important for the muwahhid mujāhid to have insight about the phenomenon especially in how it pertains to jihād.\nThe Salaf and Their Severe \nWarning against Irjā’\nThe Salaf who witnessed the emergence of Irjā’ warned  against  it  early  on.  They  knew  that  it would  lead  to  abandonment  of  both  learning and practicing the religion.\nSa’īd Ibn Jubayr (rahimahullāh – d. 95AH) said, “The Murji’ah are the Jews of the Qiblah”1 [AsSunnah – ‘Abdullāh Ibn al-Imām Ahmad].\nIbrāhīm  an-Nakha’ī  (rahimahullāh  –  d.  96AH) said,  “I  fear  the  fitnah  of  the  Murji’ah  for  this Ummah more than the fitnah of the Azāriqah [a sect of the Khawārij]” [As-Sunnah – ‘Abdullāh Ibn al-Imām Ahmad].\nHe also said, “I fear the Murji’ah for the people of Islam more than their number of the Azāriqah” [As-Sunnah – ‘Abdullāh Ibn al-Imām Ahmad].\nHe  also  said,  “In  my  opinion,  the  Khawārij  are more excused than the Murji’ah” [As-Sunnah – ‘Abdullāh Ibn al-Imām Ahmad].\nHe  also  said,  “The  Murji’ah  left  the  religion flimsier than a very thin garment” [As-Sunnah – ‘Abdullāh Ibn al-Imām Ahmad].\nHe also said, “The Murji’ah invented an opinion, so I fear them for the Ummah. The evil from them is great, so be very wary of them” [Ash-Sharī’ah – Al-Ājurrī].\nHe  also  said,  “I  don’t  know  of  a  more  foolish people  by  way  of  their  opinion  than  these Murji’ah”  [As-Sunnah  –  ‘Abdullāh  Ibn  al-Imām Ahmad].\nMujāhid (rahimahullāh – d. 104AH) said, “They \n40 FEATURE\nstart  off  as  Murji’ah,  then  become  Qadariyyah [those  who  deny  the  Qadar],  then  turn  into Majūs [fire-worshippers]” [Al-Lālikā’ī].\nQatādah  (rahimahullāh  –  d.  118AH)  and  Yahyā Ibn  Abī  Kathīr  (rahimahullāh  –  d.  129AH)  both said, “There is no deviance more feared by us for the  Ummah  than  Irjā’”  [As-Sunnah  –  ‘Abdullāh Ibn al-Imām Ahmad].\nMuhammad Ibn ‘Alī Ibn al-Husayn (rahimahullāh – d. 118AH) said, “There is nothing in day or night more similar to the Jews than the Murji’ah” [AlLālikā’ī].______________1  The  Murji’ah  invented  a  religion  whose  followers  expect  to  enter  Jannah  while completely abandoning the essential deeds of Īmān (the four pillars of Islam after the testimony of faith) and claiming to affirm its words! Accordingly, they are similar to the deluded Jews who {believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part} [Al-Baqarah: 85] and say, {“We hear and disobey”} [Al-Baqarah: 93], yet they declare, {“Never will the Fire touch us except for a few days”} [Al-Baqarah: 80] and {“We will be forgiven”} [Al-A’rāf:  169].  The  Salaf  also  compared  Irjā’  to  Christianity,  as  some  of  them  were reported to have said, “Be wary of Irjā’ for it is an aspect of Christianity” [Al-Lālikā’ī]. This is because the Christians, like the Jews, claim salvation is attainable by mere words with absolutely no deeds to back those words; Allah (ta’ālā) responded to the Jews by saying, {Say, “Have you taken a covenant with Allah? For Allah will never break His covenant. Or do you say about Allah that which you do not know?” Yes, whoever earns evil and his sin has encompassed him – those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally. But they who believe and do righteous deeds – those are the companions of Paradise;  they will  abide  therein  eternally}  [Al-Baqarah:  80-82]. He (ta’ālā)  responded to the Christians as well as the Jews by saying, {And they say, “None will enter Paradise except  one  who  is  a  Jew  or  a  Christian.”  That  is  [merely]  their  wishful  thinking,  Say, “Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.” Yes on the contrary, whoever submits his face in Islam to Allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve} [Al-Baqarah: 111-112]. See also Sūrat an-Nisā’, verses 123-124. The Jews and Christians both declared that the mere claim of faith in their messengers was sufficient to save them from Hellfire while they abandoned the essential implications of this faith, which was for them to follow the final Prophet Muhammad (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) in both words and deeds, as he was prophesized in their scriptures. Finally, Allah’s mercy and forgiveness is not an excuse to commit sins and injustices never mind shirk and kufr!\n\f"

Like most youth from migrant families, he was somewhat distant from his religion despite his father and mother both then being religious Muslims. And although life in dārul-kufr led many Muslim youth to abandon the daily prayers, Abū Junaydah was an exception. No matter what he faced in life, he would never forget salāh.\nWhen  he  was  a  child,  his  father  made  him  memorize some of the Qur’ān and go with him to the masjid. When he grew older, he appreciated this discipline as due to it, he had learned much of the book of Allah.\nAnd so Allah guides whomever He wills and He showed His mercy towards Abū Junaydah, guiding him to serious practice at the age of eighteen. He began to learn his religion on his own effort and distance himself from all bad influences. He also married early to protect himself from the traps of zinā. Shortly after, Allah bestowed him with a daughter, whom he named Junaydah.\nSaddened by the events in Shām and the crimes committed against Ahlus-Sunnah, he resolved to perform hijrah there to partake in the jihād.\nIn “2013,” he travelled to Shām and joined the faction called “Junūd ash-Shām,” led by the deviant liar Muslim ash-Shīshānī. Upon arrival, Abū Junaydah was very happy to have arrived to the lands of jihād, but he quickly found out that not every “mujāhid” and not every “jihādī” faction is on the sound manhaj. He and the other mujāhidīn were forbidden from pronouncing takfīr upon the tāghūt Erdogan and the other tawāghīt of Turkey for reasons of “maslahah.” Similarly, they were forbidden from pronouncing takfīr upon the “Free Syrian Army” (FSA). He witnessed how he himself as well as the Islamic State were strongly criticized for this. There were also many situations in which the law of Allah was violated by the local factions; the people weren’t being judged by the Sharī’ah. In one of these cases, for example, a local person insulted Allah (ta’ālā) and did not receive punishment for his crime.\nWhile he was with Junūd ash-Shām, he was joined by his best friend Abū Luqmān al-Almānī and Abū Junaydah’s \n5555\nAMONGST THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN\ncousin Abū Hafs al-Almānī in order to wage jihād against the tawāghīt everywhere and their allies. But Abū Luqmān and Abū Hafs did not stay long with Junūd ash-Shām, as they  quickly  recognized  the  corrupt  and  deviant  manhaj of  the  faction  and  understood  that  they  should  join  the Jamā’ah. Thus they both gave bay’ah to Amīrul-Mu’minīn Abū Bakr al-Husaynī al-Baghdādī (hafidhahullāh), joining the Islamic State.\nOn the day of the Sahwah treachery, Abū Luqmān and Abū Hafs were captured by the FSA and imprisoned with hundreds of other muhājirīn. But they deceived their captors into releasing them. This led them to meet Abū Junaydah again, who had abandoned Junūd ash-Shām for the Jawlānī front shortly before the Sahwah. He began to work in the Jawlānī front’s media department.\nBecause of Abū Sulaymān the Australian’s lies, Abū Junaydah had some misconceptions about the Islamic State, but his heart was longing to join the Jamā’ah, to be on its side while the whole world had assembled against it militarily, politically, economically, and even in the media realm. He also began catching many contradictions in the claims of Abū  Sulaymān  the  Australian  and  his  Sahwah  comrades against the Islamic State. In addition to this, Abū Hafs – who was stuck in Halab after his release from the early Sahwah prisons – would regularly advise Abū Junaydah to join the Islamic State.\nAnd Allah guides whomever He wills. Abū Junaydah listened to the speeches of the senile and deviant Dhawāhirī and those of the former war minister of the Islamic State, Shaykh Abū Hamzah al-Muhājir r. He listened to their \n\f5959\nINTERVIEW\n\f"

        "@value": "in  the  end  times,  Jesus  Son  of  Mary came to the tribes of Israel, but was met with fierce opposition. It is just as the Lord said, explaining this phenomenon of the majority’s rejection of the truth, “And most of mankind refuse [to follow anything] but disbelief” (Al-Isra 89).\nAs  is  well  known,  these  messengers did  not  come  empty-handed.  Each of  them  brought  with  him  a  message, often in the form of a scripture, something for the educated to read and comprehend, yet with the simple command of monotheistic worship of the Creator that even the illiterate could follow. So Moses  was  given  the Torah,  by  which the  Tribes  of  Israel  were  governed  for many  generations.  But  they  strayed from  its  original  message,  even  with their very own scribes changing its text, as the Tanakh1 testifies, “How can you say, ‘We are wise, and the law (Torah) of the Lord is with us’? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes has made it into a lie” (Jeremiah 8:8).2 So then Jesus brought the Gospel, confirming what came before him of the Torah and permitting – by the permission  of  his  Lord  –  some  of  what  was  forbidden therein. It was reported that he said, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them” (Matthew 5:17). However, just as the Torah was not fully preserved, even altered, the Gospel was also corrupted. Its original would be lost, with the oldest related manuscripts written only as commentary to the original. So instead of having an altered “Gospel of Jesus,” one finds the Gospel according to Matthew, then Mark, then Luke, then John, each with a unique take on various aspects of Jesus’ teachings, sometimes outright contradicting one another. To say the least, the authentic scripture was lost and the people strayed.As per the divine way of the Lord, another messenger was sent to bring the lost flocks back to the path of righteousness. He would be the awaited Prophet foretold by Moses and the coming Advocate prophesied by Jesus. Moreover, he would bring a message hold-\n1  The Tanakh are the Jewish scriptures consisting of three parts: the Law (Torah), the Prophets, and the Writings.2  Due to ease of reading, the English Standard Version of the Bible is used herein unless otherwise noted.\ning the promise of divine protection and heralding its bearer as the Seal of the Prophets, the final messenger, sent not to the Tribes of Israel alone – but to all of mankind. For the same Lord who sent Moses and Jesus  also  sent  Muhammad,  about  whom  He  said, “Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but [he is] the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets” (Al-Ahzab 40), and about whose message He said, “Verily We revealed the Reminder and verily We shall preserve it” (Al-Hijr 9).\nSeeking the Truth\nFalsehood should be rejected because it is false, just as the truth should be accepted and followed because it is true. It is not a matter of tradition, for the Lord has ordered that all nations be called to His worship.The pagan who feigns the excuse that religion is no more than family tradition should not be left to his deviance  without  receiving  proper  admonition.  No one should.\nLikewise, no nation – no matter how originally pure – is free of corruptive infiltrations. Even the nation of Muhammad g, as the years passed following his death, fell victim to various deviations in creed – some even reaching apostasy – at the hands of those who rejected  a  correct  understanding  of  faith,  of  Allah’s oneness, and of the divine law in general. This was \n\fChristian paganism is widespread in Trinidad and Tobago\nknowledge of only the first two commandments gave me the understanding that what they were practicing was not in line with the truth. At this point, I didn’t consider myself part of any of the Christian denominations, but that was as far as I got.\nIn school, I was exposed to all the various religions but I remained upon what I knew. When I was around twenty years old, I would come to accept the religion of truth, Islam. I was working at a call center and got to  know  a  Muslim  co-worker  there.  We  happened to share many of the same worldly interests, and for this  reason,  I  would  spend  much  time  with  him.  I used to ask him many questions about the religion. In our conversations I would ask him about the beliefs of Muslims, and would also ask him about Jesus and Muhammad, and everything he told me made sense to  me  and  was  in  line  with  what  I  remembered  of the first two commandments, so I quickly gravitated towards Islam and soon found myself debating Christians because I knew their beliefs were corrupt.\nSometimes, because I was drawn to Islam, when I saw him praying, I would pray like him, and when I did, I would feel very calm afterwards. I accompanied him to the Friday sermon a couple of times to see what it was about, and then became certain that this was the true religion – the religion of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. In the last conversation we had before  I  embraced  Islam,  I  told  him  that  I  was  planning on selling drugs to support my family. He said that this was wrong and that the ends don’t justify the means. So I replied, “You tell me that in Islam I can kill people but I can’t sell drugs to feed my family?” He then began explaining to me the ultimate purpose \nof jihad as well as enlightening me concerning some of the Muslims’ plights, and after the conversation, I was settled. So I declared the testimony of faith and became a Muslim.\nDabiq: How did you find the da’wah to jihad?\nAbu Sa’d at-Trinidadi: There was a faction of Muslims in Trinidad that was known for “militancy.” Its members  attempted  to  overthrow  the  disbelieving government but quickly surrendered, apostatized, and participated in the religion of democracy, demonstrating that they weren’t upon the correct methodology of jihad. In my case, like so many other Muslims in the West, the da’wah to jihad took hold of me through the lectures of Shaykh Anwar al-‘Awlaqi . After listening  to  his  various  lectures  repeatedly,  I  gained  a firmer  understanding  of  what  we  as  Muslims  were supposed to be doing.\nI listened to his lecture series titled “Constants on the Path of Jihad” and his lecture series on “The Book of Jihad.” By Allah’s grace, there was a man of sound knowledge who I was able to refer to and who would answer  any  questions  I  had.  His  name  was  Shaykh Ashmead Choate and he had studied hadith and graduated from one of the Islamic colleges in the Middle East. He  made hijrah to the Islamic State and attained martyrdom fighting in Ramadi.\nDabiq: Tell us about your jihad endeavor in Trini-\ndad and Tobago.\nAbu Sa’d at-Trinidadi: I, along with my brothers in \n\f"

        "@value": "Since the de-“Islamization” of the nationalist “Islamic” sahwāt began – those factions having loyalty towards the Arab and Turkish tawāghīt – not a month passes without a declaration of nationalism and democracy being released by the allies of al-Qā’idah in Shām. The tawāghīt are ordered by the crusaders to pressure the sahwāt into announcing more and more concessions for continued military and non-military aid to reach them as well as for them to gain international political support and air cover from the crusaders.\nThe concessions will not end, and thus their apostasy becomes more and more blatant for none to doubt, not even the most deviant Murji’.1 It’s reached the point that even some within the Jawlānī front realized its allies were too shameless for the Jawlānī front to continue to openly support.2 And so former alliances were scaled back, downplayed, or ignored, reaching the point that the Jawlānī front publically coordinated a handover of their frontline posts to the Shāmiyyah Front, an open ally of the American crusaders and Turkish tawāghīt. It was not a mere withdrawal brought about by nonexistent military pressure but a coordinated handover by the Jawlānī front leadership documented in photos released by their close ally. This “withdrawal” was meant to present an image to the Jawlānī front “muhājirīn” that their leadership does not cooperate with the agents of America. \n1 Although the reality of the nationalist factions was always known by the leadership of the jihād claimants, they used the claims of the Murji’ah to treat the apostate and hypocritical factions as Muslims and to justify their alliance with them against the Islamic State. See Dābiq, issue 8, “Irjā’: The Most Dangerous Bid’ah,” pages 39-56. See also Dābiq, issue 10, “Interview with Abū Samīr al-Urdunī,” pages 70-76.2 See in this issue, “In the Words of the Enemy.”\nBut  does  a  “jihād”  group  hand  over  its  posts  to  crusader agents backed by crusader jets to fight against Muslims?\nIn any event, over the last couple of months three major declarations were released by the nationalist allies of al-Qā’idah in Shām. All three declarations reek of nationalism and democracy.\nOn “15 September 2015,” a declaration was released by the “Syrian revolutionary factions” in which they said:\n“The  representatives  of  the  Syrian  revolutionary  fighting factions  have  met  together  and  discussed  the  presidential statement  by  the  UN  Security  Council  issued  on  August 17, 2015, as well as the plan proposed by the UN envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura. The meeting factions have acknowledged that the statement by the UN Security Council could provide an enabling environment for starting an objective political negotiation and trust-building among all parties. The meeting factions have reached a consensus on the following:”\n“1. We welcome the call to start a political process that leads to a political transition according to the Geneva Communiqué that stipulates establishing a transitional governing body that starts functioning as soon as an agreement on a solution is reached, and thus, performing all executive authorities, including those of the President of the Republic.”\n“2.  We  emphasize  the  precondition  of  the  departure  of Bashar al-Assad and all the pillars of his regime, and that none of them would have a place or a role in the new Syria or the transitional phase.”\n1111\nTHE ALLIES OF AL-QĀ‘IDAH IN SHĀM: THE END\n\fProbably the most memorable day after September 11th for many muwahhidīn was the day the Islamic State was announced nine years ago in Iraq (Ramadān 1427). It was a state based upon tawhīd and jihād with a Qurashī imām. It was a foundation for the future khilāfah. Its leadership disbelieved in defeatist compromise and relied upon Allah alone, even if such entailed being fought by the entire camp of kufr and deviance.\nA few months later, the Iraqi Sahwah was launched. The Americans  provided  corrupt  tribes  and  partisan  factions with the incentive and aid for the newly formed Sahwah to wage a treacherous war against the Islamic State. The Islamic State then, in 1427-1428AH, began losing territory to these crusader-backed apostates. It was experiencing just some of the tests and tribulations that all truthful believers face, as in the hadīth, “The people who face the severest tribulations are the Prophets, then those most like them, then  those  most  like  them.  A  person  is  tested  with  tribulation to the extent of his religious practice. If his practice is strong, the tribulation he faces is stronger. And if his practice is weak, the tribulation he faces is in accordance with his religious practice” [Sahīh: Reported by at-Tirmidhī from Sa’d Ibn Abī Waqqās].\nDuring the tumult of this Sahwah conspiracy, a point came in which it appeared to the weak-hearted that the Islamic State would be a legend of the past, reminding us of the Battle of al-Ahzāb {when they came at you from above you and from below you, and when eyes turned upwards [in fear], and hearts reached the throats and you assumed about Allah various assumptions. There the believers were tested and shaken severely. And remember when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease said, “Allah and His \nMessenger did not promise us except delusion”} [Al-Ahzāb: 10-12]. This was what occurred throughout the events of the Sahwah in Iraq. The believers were shaken severely but remained firm, whereas the hypocrites came out and began to criticize the creed and methodology of the Islamic State.\nAnd despite these great tribulations; a man spoke out with a truthful tongue and sincere heart; we consider him such and Allah is his judge. He was the recently appointed Amīr of the Believers, Shaykh Abū ‘Umar al-Husaynī al-Baghdādī (may Allah accept him). He spoke his words holding good assumptions about Allah, being certain of Allah’s promise, and having no doubts that Allah would ever forsake them. He said in his famous speech “The Harvest of the Years by the State of the Muwahhidīn,” released six months after the declaration of the Islamic State in Iraq and during the dark waves of the Sahwah:\n“The Islamic State is bāqiyah (remaining). It is bāqiyah because it was built from the corpses of the shuhadā’ and it was watered with their blood, and by this the market of Jannah was convened. It is bāqiyah because the success granted by Allah in this jihād is clearer than the sun in the middle of the sky. It is bāqiyah because it was not soiled by harām income nor a distorted methodology. It is bāqiyah by the truthfulness of the leaders who sacrificed their blood and the truthfulness of the soldiers who raised it with their forearms; we consider them such, and Allah is their judge. It is bāqiyah because it united the mujāhidīn and is the refuge of the oppressed. It is bāqiyah because Islam has begun to rise  and  climb,  the  dark  cloud  has  begun  to  scatter,  and kufr has begun to be defeated and exposed. It is bāqiyah because it is the supplication of the oppressed, the tear of the bereaved, the cry of the prisoner, and the hope of the \n1717\nFROM THE PAGES OF HISTORY: BĀQIYAH\n\f"

But  destroying  ISIS,  even  in a  couple  of  years,  is  just  not  possible.  If  we  succeed  in dismantling ISIS, we’re still left with a really problematic region.\nRobinson:  This  kind  of  partnered  counterterrorism  approach that the president has been talking about requires really refining how America deals with its partners. In this case,  every  partner  is  problematic.  Iraqi  security  forces have  crumbled  in  recent  months.  The  Shia  militias  are problematic.  The  Sunnis  could  potentially  turn  against ISIS, but they are very wary of this new government. The Peshmurgas, the Kurdish militia, are least problematic. Finally, the Syrian opposition is terribly weak.\nConnable: I’m not sure anybody has a clear understanding of who’s who in Syria. Identities and loyalties shift. I don’t think it’s going to cripple the strategy, but it is a serious  hurdle. The absence of a clearly envisioned end state condition is important. What is it that we want this group that we’re going to support to do after ISIS is defeated? The Free Syrian Army is the group we go to now. They’ve suffered battlefield defeats. They’re politically disorganized. I’m not sure what they would do with the Syrian state if they were able to assume control. \nLiepman: We need to remind ourselves that the president said, as did his military commanders, that this new phase of fighting against a determined and impressive enemy, will  take  some  time.  We  need  to  be  careful  about  how we define victory. We won’t vanquish this enemy. We’ll be lucky to degrade ISIS. We need patience. \nRabasa: I’m afraid we may have fallen into ISIS’s trap. We probably had no choice but to extend the airstrikes into Syria, since that is ISIS’s base of operations. But by doing so we have escalated the campaign against ISIS without deploying sufficient force to seriously degrade or destroy them. \nRabasa:  Airstrikes  will  have  diminishing  returns  as  ISIS adjusts. And standing up to the United States is likely to enhance its image among both jihadi and non-jihadi constituencies.

So  how  much more so in the case of one who followed up his repentance by fighting and being killed in the path of Allah, knowing the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) declared that such a person would  be  forgiven  the  moment  his  blood  is first spilled.\nAN ASSAULT ON FRENCH POLICE BY THE MUJĀHID BERTRAND NZOHABONAYO\nCondemning a person based on their past has been the tradition of the tawāghīt, as was done by Fir’awn.\n{[Fir’awn]  said,  “Did  we  not  raise  you  among us as a child, and you remained among us for years  of  your  life?  And  [then]  you  did  your deed which you did, and you were of the ungrateful.”  [Mūsā]  said,  “I  did  it,  then,  while  I was of those astray”} [Ash-Shu’arā’: 18-20].\nThe new Man Haron Monis was a mujāhid in the  path  of  Allah.  He  declared  himself  to  be upon  pure  tawhīd  and  from  Ahlus-Sunnah, announced  his  bay’ah  to  Khalīfah  Ibrāhim  alQurashī,  and  then  marched  forward  to  terrorize  the  kuffār  and  bring  victory  to  Allah’s religion. His shahādah is – inshā’allāh – a testament to his sincerity.\nFOREWORD\nAfter a lengthy standoff, brother Man Haron Monis was killed. His daring raid ended with two kāfir hostages dead, and four others wounded, including a police officer. Thus, he added his name to the list of Muslims who answered the Khilāfah’s call to strike those waging war against the Islamic State wherever they may be, as conveyed by its spokesman, Shaykh Abū Muhammad al-‘Adnānī. “If you can kill a disbelieving American or European – especially the spiteful and filthy French – or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be. Do not ask for anyone’s advice and do not seek anyone’s verdict” [Indeed Your Lord Is Ever Watchful].\nThere will be others who follow the examples set by Man Haron Monis and Numan Haider in Australia, Martin Couture-Rouleau and Michael Zehaf-Bibeau in Canada, Zale Thompson in America, and Bertrand Nzohabonayo in France, and all that the West will be able to do is to anxiously await the next round of slaughter and then issue the same  tired,  cliché  statements  in  condemnation of it when it occurs. The Muslims will continue to defy the kāfir war machine, flanking the crusaders on their own streets and bringing the war back to their own soil.\nBERTRAND NZOHABONAYO (RAHIMAHULLĀH)\n\fpath of Allah? So Allah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, ‘Whoever fights so that the word of Allah is the highest is fighting in the path of Allah.’”\n[2] Ask the people of knowledge what is required of you when anything befalls you concerning the obligation of jihād in the path of Allah, for there is  a  scholarly  consensus  that  knowledge  must precede  action.  Allah’s  Messenger  (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa salllam) said, “Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.”  So don’t kill or  take  ghanīmah  without  first  knowing  why you’re doing so. And the least that can be done in that regard is to seek the fatwā of a scholar whose  knowledge  and  religious  practice  you trust.\n[3]  Beware  of  letting  the  affection  you  have towards a relative or loved one turn you away from  aiding  Allah’s  religion.  Indeed,  we  know that this can tear you apart, but remember the statement of Allah (ta’ālā), {O you who have believed, do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies, extending to them affection while they  have  disbelieved  in  what  came  to  you  of the truth} [Al-Mumtahanah: 1]. For Allah’s right is more obligatory, and supporting His religion is more essential.\n[4] By Allah, I love you, and I love that which will save you. So listen to my advice concerning an important issue, the issue of takfīr. The Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “Whoever says concerning a believer that which is not true, Allah will cause him to reside in the mud of  corruption  [composed  of  the  pus  from  the people of Hellfire] until he takes back what he said.”  Therefore, know my dear brother that the label and ruling of kufr is a right that belongs to Allah (ta’ālā) and which you are not allowed to apply to anyone except those who deserve it according to the Sharī’ah. And know that takfīr has both conditions and preventative factors, so we don’t declare takfīr of someone unless the conditions are fulfilled and the preventative factors are  eliminated.  A  person  might  make  a  state-\nADVICE FOR THE SOLDIERS OF THE ISLAMIC STATE\nment  or  action  of  kufr  and  yet  would  not  be guilty of kufr due to the presence of one of the preventative factors. Therefore, one whose Islam is established with certainty is not expelled from  Islam  except  with  certainty.  So  beware of  suspicion,  and  ensure  that  you’re  well-informed regarding the issues that the practicing scholars have differed over.\n[5] Fulfill any agreements and covenants of security that are valid according to the Sharī’ah, and be extremely cautious of Shaytān’s incitements. Allah (ta’ālā) said, {So he who breaks his word  only  breaks  it  to  the  detriment  of  himself} [Al-Fath: 10]. Allah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  said,  “The  blood  of  every Muslim is equal. The lowest amongst them will have  his  guarantee  of  protection  fulfilled  by them. The most distant of them will also have his guarantee of protection honored. They are one hand against all others. The weak fighter amongst them is equal in his share of ghanīmah with the strong fighter amongst them, and the dispatched fighter who guards the rear of the army is equal in his share of ghanīmah with the fighter who is sent out on an expedition to attack.”\nLikewise, know that we do not allow any soldier to make pacts or grant security. This is only to be done by Amīrul-Mu’minīn and his deputies, for he is typically more aware of, and better capable of determining the interests of the State.\n[6] Strive hard to obey Allah and beware the ominous consequences of sin as well as the evil of your inner self and the Shaytān. For indeed alFārūq, ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattāb, advised Sa’d Ibn Abī Waqqās (radiyallāhu ‘anhumā) saying, “So I order both you and the soldiers who are with you to have taqwā of Allah, and I order both you and the soldiers who are with you to be more vigilant against committing sins than you are against your enemy, for the sins of your soldiers should be more feared than their enemy. And ask Allah to help you against your inner selves just as you ask Him for victory over your enemy.”\ndabiq\n\f"

So take warning, O people of vision} [Al-Hashr: 2].\nThe divided crusaders of the East and West thought themselves  safe  in  their  jets  as  they  cowardly  bombarded  the Muslims of the Khilāfah. {They will not fight you all except within fortified cities or from behind walls} [Al-Hashr: 14]. But Allah c decreed that punishment befall the warring crusaders  from  where  they  had  not  expected.  Thus,  the blessed  attacks  against  the  Russians  and  the  French  were successfully executed despite the international intelligence war  against  the  Islamic  State.  Both  crusader  nations  had undoubtedly destroyed their homes with their own hands through their hostilities towards Islam, the Muslims, and the Muslim body of the Khilāfah.\nOn  “30  September  2015,”  after  years  of  supporting  the Nusayrī tāghūt in the war against the Muslims of Shām, Russia decided to participate directly with its own air force in the war. It was a rash decision of arrogance from Russia, as if it held that its wars against the Muslims of al-Qawqāz were not enough offence. And so after having discovered a way to compromise the security at the Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport and resolving to bring down a plane belonging to a nation in the American-led Western coalition against the Islamic State, the target was changed to a Russian plane. A bomb was smuggled onto the airplane, \nleading to the deaths of 219 Russians and 5 other crusaders only a month after Russia’s thoughtless decision.\nA year earlier, on “19 September 2014,” France haughtily began executing airstrikes against the Khilāfah. Like Russia, it was blinded by hubris, thinking that its geographical distance from the lands of the Khilāfah would protect it from the justice of the mujāhidīn. It also did not grasp that its mockery of the Messenger g would not be left unavenged. Thus, the Islamic State dispatched its brave knights to wage war in the homelands of the wicked crusaders, leaving Paris and its residents “shocked and awed.” The eight knights brought Paris down on its knees, after years of French conceit in the face of Islam. A nationwide state of emergency was declared as a result of the actions of eight men armed only with assault rifles and explosive belts.\nAnd so revenge was exacted upon those who felt safe in the cockpits of their jets.\nAmīrul-Mu’minīn Abū Bakr al-Husaynī al-Baghdādī (hafidhahullāh) said, “By Allah, we will take revenge! By Allah, we will take revenge! Even if it takes a while, we will take revenge,  and  every  amount  of  harm  against  the  Ummah will  be  responded  to  with  multitudes  more  against  the perpetrator. {And those who, when tyranny strikes them, they defend themselves} [Ash-Shūrā: 39]. Soon, by Allah’s permission, a day will come when the Muslim will walk everywhere as a master, having honor, being revered, with his head raised high, and his dignity preserved. Anyone who dares to offend him will be disciplined, and any hand that reaches out to harm him will be cut off. So let the world know that we are living today in a new era. Whoever was heedless  must  now  be  alert.  Whoever  was  sleeping  must \n2\n\fAs the Sahwah fever spreads through the ranks of al-Qā’idah from Shām to its other branches, it is important to study the relationship between the other branches and regional apostate parties, as these relationships in addition to the irjā’ and hizbiyyah of al-Qā’idah’s leadership are the crucial driving  force  in  converting  al-Qā’idah  branches  from  parties resisting the American-led crusades into hardcore sahwāt.\nIn Khurāsān, al-Qā’idah is with the Taliban factions who announced their adoption of nationalism and resistance towards walā’ and barā’, lied to the Ummah by attributing their deviant declarations to the deceased Mullā ‘Umar, and shamelessly  flaunted  their  brotherhood  with  the  apostate tawāghīt and the Rāfidah. In India, they are the allies of the nationalist Kashmir factions whose advances and withdrawals are only by the order of the apostate Pakistani army. In North Africa, they are the allies of the Libyan factions who partook in the religion of democracy in the name of “Islam.”\nAnd in Yemen, one of the top allies of al-Qā’idah – after the ‘Abd Rabbuh battalions, the “Islāh” parliamentarians, and the pro-Saudi “Salafiyyah” of Dammaj and Ma’rib – is the “Hadhrami Domestic Council.” According to the introduction found on the council’s official website, “The Hadhrami Domestic Council in the city of al-Mukallā – the capital of Hadramawt – was formed and then announced on Monday, 13 April 2015, to be an authority for administering \n55\nTHE ALLIES OF AL-QĀ‘IDAH IN YEMEN\nKhālid Bāturfī - The new Harārī of Yemen\nthe affairs of the Hadramawt capital city of al-Mukallā after  being  granted  control  over  it  by  those  who  collapsed it – Ansār ash-Sharī’ah, ‘The Sons of Hadramawt’1 – on 2 April 2015.2 The Hadhrami Domestic Council was formed by a fine selection of the sincere men of Hadramawt including religious scholars, prominent figures, tribal figures, social  figures,  businessmen,  academics,  engineers,  media professionals, and officers in the army and security forces. They shouldered their historical responsibility at a crucial moment for the sake of Hadramawt. They did not abandon it to an unknown future. They kept it from being a target of foreign forces, lack of authority and security, theft, destruction, and chaos. This is from the most important goals for which the Hadhrami Domestic Council was formed, in addition to shouldering the responsibility of administering the affairs of the city with the aid of the citizens and by preserving its security and stability and securing the continued delivery of necessary services including water, food supplies, electricity, medical care, waste management, education, and other services. The council also has high hopes in its citizens contributing towards achieving these noble goals and normalizing public life, each person in his realm of work and specialization, and that they will unite their ranks for the \n1 Editor’s Note: “The Sons of Hadramawt” is the new name used by the Yemeni branch of al-Qā’idah as it dodges its former name “Ansār ashSharī’ah.”2 Editor’s Note: The coordinated handover of al-Mukallā by al-Qā’idah to this council was mentioned in Dābiq, issue 10, pages 67-68.\n\f"

Having heeded the lessons of years spent fighting the harshest of wars in modern times, the soldiers of the Islamic State promise their adversaries dark days of death and destruction in their own lands. Bullets and shrapnel will slash and pierce all those whom Allah’s  soldiers  reach.  Survivors  will  be  scarred  physically  and mentally, haunted whenever their eyes are closed, whenever they blink. The sounds of sirens will fill the air, preceded by blasts from bombs planted in all the right places. The damage to their economy, their infrastructure, and their sources of income will make their lives harder than they now imagine. And it will not end there, not until the rule of Allah reaches east to west and the Muslims walk undisturbed by the kāfir filth beneath them.\nUnlike the slaves of Shaytān, who strike with all their mortal might yet fear their mortal fate, the slaves of ar-Rahmān are prepared to meet their Lord, hopeful of His acceptance. Those kuffār who presume their bombs and proxy soldiers will cause the Islamic State to stop should realize that the soldiers of the Khilāfah have surrendered themselves to Allah, the Creator of all things and Master of the Universe. There is thus no possibility  of  their  surrender  to  humans.  The  crusaders,  on the other hand, have no eventual choice but to accept defeat. While arrogance will prevent them today, it is only a matter of time – after as many blessed operations as Allah facilitates for His soldiers in their lands – before the crusaders’ resolve dissipates and they fall at the feet of the invading lions, appealing for amnesty and begging to pay jizyah.\n5\fhe  started  giving  da’wah  in  his  neighborhood,  calling  the  youth  to  make  hijrah to  Shām.  He  also  wrote  a  few  articles  on the crusades of the era fought by the West against the Muslims.\nAll  preparations  for  the  raids  in  Paris and Brussels started with him and his older brother Ibrāhīm. These two brothers gathered the weapons and the explosives. After the  blessed  raid  in  Paris,  he  saw  another dream, which motivated him to carry out an istishhādī operation. He narrated, “The second  dream  was  three  months  ago.  It was a vision that took place from fajr until dhuhr. I arose to a high place, as if I was in space, surrounded by stars; but the sky was like the blue of night.” He then heard a voice in the dream telling him that he was created only to worship Allah and ordering him to fight for His cause and make His word supreme. He then woke up.\nAbū Walīd then narrated a third dream: “I  had  a  vision  that  also  took  place  from fajr until dhuhr, but ended at night. I saw myself on a boat along with Abū Sulaymān and another brother. Each of us had a Turkish soldier as a hostage. I had a pistol and Abū Sulaymān had a belt. I told him to give me his belt, as I would feel better having it. So he gave me the belt and I gave him my pistol. I then quickly advanced with the Turkish hostage in order to close in on other soldiers, two of whom were in front of us. I detonated my belt, killing the soldiers. My head then descended to the ground. One of the brothers working on the operation and Shaykh al-‘Adnānī took my head and said, ‘Check to see if he is smiling or not.’ I then saw my soul and those of the three soldiers. All of a sudden, the soldiers’ souls burned and vanished and, suddenly, the banner of Islam  –  represented  in  the  dream  by  the flag of the Islamic State – came out of the earth  and  was  shining  brightly.  My  soul then became full of light.” He then heard a voice in the dream telling him that he had achieved  deliverance.  Abū  Walīd  continued,  “I  prostrated  quickly  and  repeatedly pronounced  the  takbīr.  I  then  awoke  to find my heart beating fast, and I was taking quick breaths.”\nNajm al-‘Ashrāwī (Abū Idrīs al-Baljīkī)\nBrussels Airport Istishhādī\nHe was a unique man, possessing excellent manners, always in the service of his brothers, and very intelligent. His hijrah began in “2013,” when he heard the cry of Muslims in Shām. He joined Majlis Shūrā al-Mujāhidīn led by Abul-Athīr al‘Absī (may Allah accept him) and, when the traitor al-Jawlānī betrayed the Islamic State, he was one of the first, along with the rest of his group, to pledge allegiance to Amīrul-Mu’minīn Abū Bakr al-Baghdādī.\nHe participated in several battles against the Nusayrī regime before the FSA apostates started to fight the mujāhidīn. Proving  himself  steadfast  during  the  sahwah  in  Shām,  he fought them until the order came to withdraw to ar-Raqqah. He continued to participate in raids until he suffered a bullet wound to his leg in a raid against Jabhat al-Jawlānī in alKhayr.\nAfter healing for several months, he began to train in order to realize his dream of returning to Europe to avenge the Muslims of Iraq and Shām for the constant bombing by crusader warplanes. Upon completing his training, he traveled the long road to France to execute his operation. It was Abū Idrīs who prepared the explosives for the two raids in Paris and Brussels.\nMuhammad Bilqā’id (Abū ‘Abdil-‘Azīz al-Jazā’irī)Defended the Mujāhidīn During a Police Raid\nBefore returning to France, Abū ‘Abdil-‘Azīz participated in several raids against the Nusayrī regime. The most prominent of these battles were those of Kuwayris Airbase and the 17th Division. During his campaigning, he suffered an injury to his leg while fighting the sahwāt in Dimashq. He also took part in the conquest of ar-Ramādī, where a bullet struck his head.He was a man full of wisdom, the commander of a group of  inghimāsī  troops.  Liked  by  all  of  the  brothers,  he  was known for his fasting, his praying throughout the night, and his constant reading of the Qur’ān. When he heard that Abū Idrīs wanted to return to Europe to execute an istishhādī operation, he immediately decided to accompany him and assist him in his mission.\nWhile in Belgium, and during the final stages of preparation for the raid in Brussels, kāfir police stormed his apartment. Though he had the ability to escape with his team, he decided to make this his final stand and to ensure his brothers a  safe  exit.  He  exchanged  fire  with  the  Belgian  and  French forces  for  several  hours,  injuring  a  number  of  them,  as  his brothers took off into the forest.\n7\f"

Secondly, we have seen that the Khilāfah declared by the leadership of the Islamic State has  fulfilled  all  the  conditions enumerated by the scholars from among the righteous Salaf of the Ummah.  The  Prophet  g  said, “Whoever  dies  without  having  a pledge of allegiance, dies a death of jāhiliyyah” [Reported by Muslim from Ibn ‘Umar]. Thirdly, we saw  the  crusaders,  the  Rāfidah, the PKK atheists, and all the other kāfir parties uniting against the Khilāfah and striking it altogether from a single bow. And thus, we realized  that  it  is  an  obligation upon us and the rest of the believers to join the camp of īmān and fight  against  the  kuffār,  striking them altogether from a single bow as well. Allah c said, {And those who  disbelieved  are  allies  of  one another. If you do not do so, there will be fitnah on earth and great corruption}  [Al-Anfāl:  73].\nDĀBIQ:  How  was  the  reaction among the Muslims of Bengal towards  the  operations  conducted by  the  Khilāfah  soldiery  there?\nSH.  ABŪ  IBRĀHĪM:  The  muwahiddīn  in  Bengal  were  greatly  supportive  of  our  operations against  the  kuffār,  walhamdulillāh. They saw us fighting against all  the  kuffār  in  our  targeting  of the  crusaders,  the  Rāfidah,  the Qādiyāniyyah,  the  Hindus,  the missionaries, and others, all within  a  short  period  of  time.  They saw that with the help of Allah, a small number of mujāhidīn with limited  means  are  able  to  target and  intimidate  the  various  sects of kufr in any part of the region despite all the false claims of supremacy attributed to the tāghūt \nforces and designed  to  intimidate the believers. This brought  hope to  the  Muslims in Bengal after a lengthy pause in jihād in  the  region. Thus,  by  the grace of Allah, the  revival  of the in Bengal  through  our  operations brought  happiness  to  the  Muslims  in  Bengal  and  everywhere else while also enraging the kuffār.

ABŪ IBRĀHĪM: Alhamdulillāh,  the  emergence  of  the  soldiers of the Khilāfah has terrified the kuffār in the region in general and in particular the atheists and secularists  who  mock  Islam  and our  beloved  Prophet  g.  This became  evident  when  some  of the leading atheists in the region claimed  to  have  received  death threats  from  the  soldiers  of  the Khilāfah in Bengal. But it is not the methodology of the Khilāfah’s soldiers  to  send  mere  threats  to the enemies of Allah. Rather, we let our actions do the talking. And our  soldiers  are  presently  sharpening  their  knives  to  slaughter the  atheists,  the  mockers  of  the Prophet g, and every other apostate in the region, bi idnillāh. We say  just  as  Shaykh  Usāmah  Ibn \nLādin  said, “If there is no limit to the freedom of your words, then let your hearts be open to the freedom  of  our  actions.”\nDĀBIQ: Tell us about the general state of Islam and religiousness in Bengal.\nSH. ABŪ IBRĀHĪM: In general, the people of Bengal love Islam and  try  to  practice  its  rites  with great enthusiasm. However, there is much ignorance of the Qur’ān and  the  Sunnah  here,  leading  to the growing influence of heretical sects and murtadd parties. Wa lā hawla wa lā quwwata illā billāh.\nDĀBIQ: What deviant and apostate sects exist in Bengal?\nSH.  ABŪ  IBRĀHĪM:  Sadly, there are many deviant and apostate sects in Bengal. First, there is a small number of Rāfidah in Bengal who are funded and supported by  the  Iranian  government.  Secondly, there is a significant number  of  Qādiyāniyyah  in  Bengal. Thirdly,  there  is  a  large  number of  apostates  who  have  converted from Islam to Christianity due to the  deceptive  preaching  carried out by local and foreign missionaries  and  the  relentless  efforts  of \n\f"

In  Ramadān,  at  “Camp Bucca” prison in Umm Qasr, he used to lead  the  brothers  in  prayer,  completing a  whole  recitation  of  the  Qur’ān,  with other  brothers  behind  him  who  had also  memorized  the  Qur’ān.  He  mixed more  with  virtuous  brothers,  people  of goodness,  and  experience.  He  used  to fast  and  pray  a  lot  at  night,  striving  to be close to Allah (ta’ālā). He was a close friend  for  his  brothers  and  source  of steadfastness for them wherever he was.\n(rahimahullāh).  Thus, \nHe  then left  prison  with  increased steadfastness, knowledge, and experience. Thereupon  he  worked  as  amīr  of  arRasāfah  region  in  Baghdad.  He  ignited war  and  launched  attacks  under  the leadership  of  the  notable  Wālī  Manāf ar-Rāwī they launched  the  famous  Battles  of  al-Asīr (the Prisoner), by which the strongholds of the Safawī Rāfidah collapsed and the Rāfidī bastions of shirk and the bases of the mushrik army were demolished. They raided  the  most  heavily  guarded  places like  the  Central  Bank  and  the  Defense Ministry, the latter being a base for joint \nThe “Our Lady of Salvation” Catholic church  in Baghdad was assaulted by the mujāhidīn\noperations  with  the  crusaders.  Thus,  the  ministries  and pillars of the Rāfidī government collapsed at their blessed hands until the heroic Wālī fell into captivity.  Hudhayfah was then assigned leadership of all Baghdad as its Wālī. So he ignited it with vehicle bombs, demolishing the fortresses of the Rāfidah as well as their Safawī and Crusader masters, in  retaliation  for  the  religion  of  Allah  against  the  filthy mushrikīn and in revenge for the honor of Ahlus-Sunnah, which was desecrated at the hands of the most evil creatures to  tread  on  earth.  He  terrorized  the  Safawī  regime  and degraded it, deploying heroic soldiers armed with silencers. \nThe murtaddīn mourning the crusaders killed in the attack on the church\ndabiq\n\fSaby (taking slaves through war) is a great prophetic Sunnah  containing  many  divine  wisdoms  and religious benefits, regardless of whether or not the people are aware of this. The Sīrah is a witness to our Prophet’s (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) raiding of the kuffār. He would kill their men and enslave their children and women. The raids of the beloved Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) convey this to  us.  Ask  the  tribes  of  Banī  al-Mustaliq,  Banī Quraydhah, and Hawāzin about this.\nIbn ‘Awn said, “I wrote to Nāfi’, so he wrote back to me saying, ‘The Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam)  raided  Banī  al-Mustaliq  while  they  were not  expecting  it  and  while  their  cattle  were  out drinking water. So he killed their fighters, enslaved their children, and gained Juwayriyah. Ibn ‘Umar told  me  this.  And  he  was  part  of  that  army’” [Reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim].\nAfter  the  Battle  of  the Trench,  Banī  Quraydhah yielded  to  the  judgment  of  Sa’d  Ibn  Mu’ādh (radiyallāhu ‘anh). So Sa’d said, “I rule that their fighters be killed and their families be enslaved.” So Allah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said,  “You  have  indeed  judged  in  their  affair  by the ruling of Allah” [Reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim].\nThe  number  of  Jews  killed  in  the  battles  of Khaybar  reached  93  men  [Maghāzī  al-Wāqidī]. Their  women  and  children  were  enslaved,  and Safiyyah Bint Huyayy Ibn Akhtab – the Mother of  the  Believers  (radiyallāhu  ‘anhā)  –  fell  into captivity. Allah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) set her free and married her [Reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim].\nAnd  during  the  expedition  of  Hunayn,  Allah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) enslaved from Hawāzin until the amount of slaves reached six thousand [At-Tabaqāt al-Kubrā – Ibn Sa’d].\nThe scholars of Sīrah mentioned that the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) took four slave-girls as  concubines,  two  of  them  being  Māriyah  alQibtiyyah  and  Rayhānah  an-Nadriyyah  [Zād  alMa’ād].\nThe Sahābah and their followers in goodness treaded upon the path of the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) after him. Therefore, we almost cannot find a companion who didn’t practice saby. ‘Alī Ibn Abī Tālib (radiyallāhu ‘anh) had nineteen slave-girls. Ibn ‘Uyaynah reported that ‘Amr Ibn Dīnār said, “’Alī Ibn Abī Tālib wrote in his will, ‘As to what follows: If something happens to me during this battle, then my slave-girls whom I copulate with are nineteen in number. Some of them bore me children, some of them are pregnant, and some of them are childless’” [Musannaf ‘Abdir-Razzāq].\nAbū Sa’īd al-Khudrī (radiyallāhu ‘anh) said, “I had a slave-girl with whom I used to practice withdrawal. She  bore  me  the  most  beloved  of  people  to  me” [Musannaf ‘Abdir-Razzāq].\nAfter  all  this  and  after  the  sun  of  the  Khilāfah radiated once again, and the winds of victory and consolidation  blew,  and  the  Islamic  State,  by  the grace  of  its  Lord  alone,  brought  out  the  Islamic punishments and rulings of the Sharī’ah from the darkness of books and papers, and we truly lived them after they were buried for centuries… After all this, the ramblers dare to extend their tongues with false rumors and accusations so as to disfigure the great shar’ī ruling and pure prophetic Sunnah titled “saby”? After all this, saby becomes fornication and tasarrī (taking a slave-girl as a concubine) becomes rape? If only we’d heard these falsehoods from the kuffār who are ignorant of our religion. Instead we hear  it  from  those  associated  with  our  Ummah, those whose names are Muhammad, Ibrāhīm, and ‘Alī! So I say in astonishment: Are our people awake or asleep? But what really alarmed me was that some of the Islamic State supporters (may Allah forgive them) rushed to defend the Islamic State – may its honor  persist  and  may  Allah  expand  its  territory –  after  the  kāfir  media  touched  upon  the  State’s capture  of  the  Yazīdī  women.  So  the  supporters started denying the matter as if the soldiers of the Khilāfah had committed a mistake or evil.\nThus, after the matter transcended its limits and the barking of the charlatans – the wicked scholars – rose upon the pulpits of deviance, it became necessary to face their declarations with a declaration, but one \ndabiq\n\f"

It is essential that you make all your deeds sincerely for Allah’s face and hope for His reward.

Nourish your love of Allah and His Messenger. It is essential for you to love Allah and His Messenger more than  your  own  selves,  your  husbands,  your children, and your parents. Follow the example of Āsiyah – the wife of Pharaoh – who left the Dunyā  for  Allah  and  the  Hereafter  although she  was  a  queen  and  had  the  wealth  of  the Dunyā.  She  was  tortured  and  killed  because of  this  choice,  but  Allah  kept  her  firm  and raised her above many women. And all praise is due to Allah, the Forgiving and Generous. Follow  the  example  of  Maryam  (‘alayhassalām)  in  her  chastity,  modesty,  obedience of Allah, and truthfulness, which was one of her greatest traits, and so Allah chose her and raised her above many women.

These  grizzly events, as we have seen with the Japanese and Jordanian hostages, are stage managed in order to gain maximum publicity and inspire general terror.”\n“Isis  has  suffered  setbacks,  but  has  also had  successes.  This  week,  its  forces  were finally  driven  out  of  the  Syrian  Kurdish  town of  Kobani  after  a  siege  lasting  134  days,  in which it suffered heavy losses from 606 US air strikes.  But  elsewhere  in  Syria,  Isis  has  been advancing towards the city of Homs as well as gaining strength south of Damascus and at alQalamoun,  close  to  eastern  Lebanon.  By  one account, Isis has won control of territory since last September where one million Syrians live, in addition to the area it already held.”\n“In Iraq, government forces have made advances in  the  provinces  around  Baghdad,  but  earlier this  week  bullets  hit  a  plane  and  wounded passengers over Baghdad International Airport, forcing major airlines to stop flying there. This isolates the Iraqi capital and, though the airport is  not  completely  closed,  Isis  could  probably achieve this at any moment.”\nHe then went on to say:\n“According  to  the  International  Centre  for  the Study  of  Radicalisation  and  Political  Violence, the number of foreign fighters joining Isis in Iraq and Syria has risen from 15,000 last October to 20,000 today. A fifth of these come from Western Europe. Isis has also conscripted fighters in the territories it controls.”\n“Isis is being squeezed militarily and economically, but there is no sign of it imploding. Even its loss of Kobani is not necessarily a sign of weakness, since it held on for months despite fighting … [the] Syrian Kurds, backed by an intensive US air bombardment in a confined place.”\nIN THE WORDS OF THE ENEMY\n“Western  analysts  are  encouraged  by  the number  of  experienced Isis  commanders killed last year, but its ideology is built around martyrdom, and the high casualty rate among leaders  shows  that  they  fight  in  the  frontline. President Obama says America’s main effort is in Iraq but unless it can rebuild the Iraqi army then  it  will  be  near  impossible  to  defeat  Isis there. And so long as Isis continues, so too will high profile hostage-taking and executions.”\nThe  Washington  Post  Editorial  Board  also commented on the “victories” of the coalition, saying:\n“A small victory in Syria is no reason to celebrate as the Islamic State gets stronger. US officials are celebrating a modest victory in the war against the  Islamic  State  in  Syria  –  the  apparently successful  defense  of  the  Kurdish  town  of Kobane, on the border with Turkey. Under siege since early October, Kobane has little strategic value but came to be seen as a test of whether the United States and its allies could stop the expansion of the Islamic State … With the help of  Kurdish  ground  forces,  the  extremists  were turned  back.  But  perhaps  the  most  significant fact about Kobane is that it consumed 75 percent of  the  nearly  1,000  airstrikes  carried  out  by allied planes throughout Syria since September … In the rest of the Syrian territory it controls, including its capital of Raqqa, the Islamic State … is growing stronger rather than weaker.”\nOr in the words of the crusader Eric Shawn of Fox News:\n“The president promises ISIS will be destroyed. Instead, it is only spreading … Coalition forces did  finally  beat  back  ISIS  in  the  key  border town of Kobani … It reportedly took 75 percent of  all  the  air  strikes  launched  there  so  far  to accomplish it. And despite that one glimmer of hope,  the  Islamic  state  vows  to  recapture  the town  as  it  scores  successes  elsewhere  …  The Islamic state’s territory has grown in the last five months … despite all of the coalition air strikes.”\ndabiq\n\f"

He will not accept from them anything but war and he will not offer them anything but the sword.” An-Nu’mānī also reports that Ja’far as-Sādiq said, “When al-Qā’im from the family of the Prophet emerges, he will bring five hundred people from Quraysh and strike their necks. He will then bring five  hundred  more  and  strike  their  necks.  He  will  do so  six  times  [thereby  killing  three  thousand  men  from Quraysh].  He  will  kill  them  and  their  patrons.”  He also  reports  that  Ja’far  as-Sādiq2  said,  “When  al-Qā’im emerges,  nothing  will  be  between  him  and  both  the Arabs and Quraysh except the sword.”\nSo  the  Rāfidī  “Mahdī”  speaks  in  Hebrew,  rules  by  the Torah,  is  followed  by  the  Jews,  and  kills  the  Arabs especially Quraysh! Is this a description of the Mahdī or the  Dajjāl?  Consider  that  seventy  thousand  Jews  from Asbahān  (Isfahan  of  modern-day  Iran)  will  follow  the Dajjāl as in the hadīth reported by Muslim from Anas .\nAlso consider that the Dajjāl will emerge from the region of the Khawārij as in the hadīth reported by Ibn Mājah from Ibn ‘Umar . And also consider that those who deny  Qadar  are  from  the  followers  of  the  Dajjāl  as  in the hadīth reported by Abū Dāwūd from Hudhayfah . This is important for two reasons, the Rāfidah are from the  biggest  Khārijī  sects.  They  and  the  other  Khawārij have a common root in the Jew ‘Abdullāh Ibn Saba’, who partook  in  the  mutiny  against  the  righteous  Khalīfah ‘Uthman  .  For  this  reason,  some  of  the  scholars have also referred to the Khawārij as “Saba’iyyah.”3  In 2 Note that Muhammad al-Bāqir, Ja’far as-Sādiq, and al-Hasan al-‘Askarī  were not Rāfidah. They were from the family of the Prophet  just as ‘Alī, Fātimah, al-Hasan, and al-Husayn  were from the family of the Prophet . And just as the Rāfidah fabricated lies in the name of ‘Alī and his immediate family , they fabricated lies in the name of his noble descendants .3 The closeness of the Rāfidah to the other Khawārij is visible in the walā’ between Iran \n70,000 Jews from Asbahān will follow the Dajjāl\naddition,  the  Rāfidah  are  infamous  for  pronouncing takfīr  upon  the  majority  of  the  Ummah  including  the best of the Ummah – the Companions of the Prophet  – rejecting the authority of the khulafā’, even cooperating with  the  Crusaders  and  the Tatars  against  the  khulafā’ and their Muslim subjects. The Rāfidah have a history of  massacring  Muslims  who  refuse  Rāfidī  beliefs.  This became most manifest during the Safawī empire (“15011736CE”) and its war against Ahlus-Sunnah in Persia. Finally, the Rāfidah are one of the sects of Qadariyyah, as they deny that good and evil deeds are by Allah’s qadar.\nHence  the  apostate  Rāfidah  combined  between  major shirk (worship of the family of the Prophet ), denial of  the  Qur’ān  and  the  Sunnah  (as  they  claim  the Companions  fabricated the religious texts), takfīr of the Companions   and the Mothers of the Believers , and belief in the deviant innovations of the Khawārij and Qadariyyah. When reflecting upon this and the fact that the Jews await their so-called Messiah – as the Jews deny  the  messengership  of  Jesus  ,  who  will  return before the Hour – it is expected that the Rāfidah will ally blatantly with the Jews in the future in their war against Islam and the Muslims.4 \nWe  seek  refuge  with  Allah  for  Ahlus-Sunnah  from  the evil of the Dajjāl.\nand Oman. Oman is ruled solely and populated mostly by the Ibādiyyah. The Ibādiyyah are historically a deviant Khārijī sect; but over the last centuries they have mutated into an apostate Jahmī sect. Their tāghūt “sultan” legislates manmade laws and has walā’ to the Crusaders, the Arab and non-Arab tawāghīt including Āl Salūl, and the Rāfidah.4 Although it is not possible to know with certainty how exactly such will come about, it is interesting to note that 340 Jewish American rabbis recently wrote a letter addressed to the American congress in support of American-Iranian reconciliation, as reported by “I24News” (a Jewish news channel) on “18 August 2015” in an article titled “Hundreds of US Rabbis Voice Support for Iran Nuclear Deal.” The report adds that the Jewish Defense Forces Military Intelligence Directorate’s Research Department presented its stance to the political leadership of the Jewish state and “emphasized the possible benefits that could come of the deal.”\ndabiq\n\fThe  past  year  has  seen  a  number  of  high-profile  racerelated  incidents  dominate  the  headlines  in  America, bringing  the  topic  of  racism  back  into  the  spotlight across the country, and like most other major issues that take center stage in the crusader media, racism does not go ignored by the Muslim minority living in the lands of kufr. Their “leaders” address the issue with an effort to  give  the  topic  an  “Islamic”  flavor,  but  typically  fall short. When tackling the issue from such a perspective, “Islamic”  preachers  and  writers  often  do  so  with humanistic  undertones  that  seek  to  portray  Islam  as  a religion of peace that teaches Muslims to coexist with all. Deluded by the open-ended concept of “tolerance,” they cite numerous āyāt and ahādīth that – rightfully so – serve to demonstrate that racial hatred has no place in Islam, but they do so for the purpose of advancing an agenda that attempts to “Islamize” more “liberal” concepts that the  kuffār  apply  across  the  board  for  achieving  evil, such  as  political  pluralism,  freedom  of  religion  ,  and acceptance of sodomites. In doing so, these “du’āt” seek to encourage the kāfir societies they live in to be more accepting of them, rather than meeting the enmity of the mushrikīn with hatred and disavowal. They forego the concept of walā’ and barā’ (loyalty and disavowal for the cause of Allah), not bothering to educate their readers of the Muslim’s obligation to reject kufr, separate himself from the kuffār, abandon their lands, harbor enmity and hatred towards them, and wage war against them until they submit to the truth.\n{There has already been for you an excellent pattern in Ibrāhīm  and  those  with  him,  when  they  said  to  their people,  “Indeed,  we  are  disassociated  from  you  and from whatever you worship other than Allah. We have denied you, and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone”} [Al-Mumtahanah: 4].\nThe example of Ibrāhīm  and those with him – meaning the prophets of Allah, as mentioned by the scholars of tafsīr – which was praised by Allah as being an excellent example  for  us  to  follow,  is  for  one  to  be  prepared  to reject his own people when they fall into kufr and shirk, and not to remain attached to them on account of tribal or blood ties. If this is the case with one’s own people with whom a common lineage is shared, how much more so in the case of those with whom one shares nothing more than a superficial characteristic such as skin color!\nThus,  the  correct  way  to  approach  the  issue  of  racism from an Islamic perspective is to reassert the importance and significance of walā’ and barā’, and to state in clear and unequivocal terms that those who wage war against \nIslam and the Muslims will not be spared on account of their skin color or ethnicity. The fate of a kāfir waging war against the Muslims is one and the same across the entire racial spectrum – slaughter.\nThe  reason  for  this  is  simple:  A  Muslim’s  loyalty  is determined, not by his skin color, his tribal affiliation, or his last name, but by his faith. He loves those whom Allah loves and hates those whom Allah hates. He forges alliances for the cause of Allah and breaks relations for the cause of Allah. \nThe  mufassir  of  the  Ummah,  ‘Abdullāh  Ibn  ‘Abbās   said,  “Love  for  the  sake  of  Allah,  hate  for  the  sake  of Allah, make allegiance for the sake of Allah, and make enemies  for  the  sake  of  Allah,  for  the  wilāyah  (loving guardianship) of Allah is not attained except by this. One will  not  find  the  taste  of  īmān,  even  if  his  prayer  and fasting is great, until he is like this” [Reported by Ibn alMubārak in “Az-Zuhd” and by al-Lālikā’ī].\nThis  statement  of  Ibn  ‘Abbās  echoes  that  made  by  the Prophet    when  declaring  walā’  and  barā’  to  be  the strongest bond of faith. Al-Barā’ Ibn ‘Āzib  said that they were sitting with the Prophet  when he  asked, “What bond of Islam is the strongest?” They said, “The prayer.” He  said, “It is good, but it is not it.” They said, “The zakāh.” He  said, “It is good, but it is not it.” They said, “Fasting Ramadān.” He  said, “It is good, but it is not it.” They said, “The hajj.” He  said, “It is good, but it is not it.” They said, “Jihād.” He  said, “It is good, but it is not it. Indeed, the strongest bond of Islam is to love for the sake of Allah and hate for the sake of Allah” [Reported by Imām Ahmad and others].\nIt was this principle – the strongest and most firm bond of Islam – that led Abū Bakr as-Siddīq  to spend an enormous  quantity  of  wealth  in  order  to  purchase  the Ethiopian slave Bilāl  and set him free. When Bilāl’s owner  Umayyah  ridiculed  Abū  Bakr  at  the  conclusion of the transaction stating that he would have sold him for  one  tenth  of  the  price  they’d  agreed  on,  Abū  Bakr retorted that if Umayyah had demanded ten times the agreed price he would have paid it. Years later, Abū Bakr and 300 other Arabs would march forth in the Battle of Badr  alongside  the  former  Ethiopian  slave  striking  the necks of their own people. That day would be referred thereafter  as  the  Day  of  Furqān,  the  day  that  Allah divided between truth and falsehood at the hands of a people who slay and imprison their own people for the cause of Allah. No day before it made it more clear that all past affiliations were broken, leaving only one bond remaining – the bond between a believing Muslim and \ndabiq\n\f"

The blasphemer was killed by stoning. “Whoever blasphemes the name of the Lord shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him” (Leviticus 24:16). As for the apostate or any who calls to worshiping other gods, then “you shall not yield to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him, nor shall you conceal him. But you shall kill him. Your hand shall be first against him to put him to death” (Deuteronomy 13:8-9). Likewise, the murderer was executed.  “Whoever  takes  a  human  life  shall  surely be  put  to  death”  (Leviticus  24:17).  And  sodomites were slain. “If a man lies with a male as with a woman,  both  of  them  have  committed  an  abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them” (Leviticus 24:13). Furthermore, there was retribution (known as “qisas” in the Shari’ah). “If anyone injures his neighbor, as he has done it shall be done to him” (Leviticus 24:19), and “you shall pay life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe” (Exodus 21:23-25). In Psalms, a wisdom behind divinely-ordained killing is mentioned. “When He killed them, they sought Him; they repented and sought  God  earnestly”  (Psalms  78:34),  just  as  elsewhere in the Old Testament, one finds that “cursed is he who keeps back his sword from bloodshed” (Jeremiah 48:10).\nEven  Jesus,  whom  the  Christians  have  titled  the \nKilled for the abominable crime of sodomy\n“Prince of Peace,” is recorded in their scripture as saying, “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword” (Matthew 10:34). There is also Jesus’ order to his followers of being armed, as it is said, “And let the one  who  has  no  sword  sell  his  cloak  and  buy  one” (Luke 22:36). Also, while telling a parable, it is written that Jesus said, “But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here  and  slaughter  them  before  me”  (Luke  19:27). As for upholding the Law, then in an apparent move to command virtue and forbid vice, which is chiefly done with physical force, all four “gospels” mention the story of Jesus violently expelling the moneychangers from the temple. “And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. He said to them, ‘It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you make it a den of robbers’” (Matthew  21:12-13).  Furthermore,  everything  that  was mentioned from the Old Testament of war and enforcing laws was kept, unless specifically mentioned otherwise, in the Gospel of Jesus. “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them” (Matthew 5:17).\nHowever, despite these clear references to violently applying  the  Law  of  the  Lord,  Christians  have  cast aside such commandments and instead have followed papal decrees and the sermons of priests – showing that their love for men is greater than their love for the Creator of men. Indeed they have cast aside their \n\f"

These narrations typically speak of the final battles that the Muslims will engage in with the Christians and Jews, including the confrontation in which the Muslims are led by ‘Īsā (‘alayhis-salam) against the Dajjāl.\nIf Allah had willed, He could have left the Muslims to witness this epic engagement under the leadership  of  an  ordinary  man  from  amongst them.  Instead,  He  decreed  that  it  would  be  a Prophet – returning as a follower of the Sharī’ah of Muhammad (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) – who would deal the decisive blow to the Dajjāl and his followers, the cursed Jews, who have a history of betraying and even killing the Prophets of Allah. It would be one of the very Prophets whom they tried, but failed, to kill that would slay their “awaited king.”\n{And [We cursed them] for their breaking of the covenant and their disbelief in the signs of Allah and their killing of the Prophets without right and their  saying,  “Our  hearts  are  covered.”  Rather, Allah has sealed them because of their disbelief, so they believe not, except for a few. And [We cursed them] for their disbelief and their saying against Maryam a great slander. And [for] their saying, “Indeed, we have killed the Masīh, ‘Īsā, the son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah.” And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them} [An-Nisā’: 155-157].\nThus, the return of Īsā (‘alayhis-salām)  would immediately  be  followed,  not  by  peace,  but by a confrontation with the enemies of Allah.

This is a threat that will not be belied”} [Hūd: 65].\nA legacy that saw Prophets lead the battle against the forces of kufr.\n{And  how  many  a  Prophet [fought and] with him fought \nmany religious scholars} \n[ĀL ‘IMRĀN: 146].\nAnd a legacy that saw Prophets triumph and prevail against all odds.\n{So they defeated them by the permission of Allah, and Dāwūd killed Jālūt, and Allah gave him the kingship and Prophethood and taught him from that which He willed} [Al-Baqarah: 251].\nThe  legacy  of  the  Prophets  was  a  legacy  of  confrontation and in every case, the confrontation between the Prophets and the disbelievers continued to escalate until it eventually reached either a point of physical battle, or a point of wholesale annihilation as the punishment of Allah descended upon the disbelievers unexpectedly. \ndabiq\n\f"

        "@value": "Because much of what has befallen the Ummah is due to this deviant innovation, it is important for the muwahhid mujāhid to have insight about the phenomenon especially in how it pertains to jihād.\nThe Salaf and Their Severe \nWarning against Irjā’\nThe Salaf who witnessed the emergence of Irjā’ warned  against  it  early  on.  They  knew  that  it would  lead  to  abandonment  of  both  learning and practicing the religion.\nSa’īd Ibn Jubayr (rahimahullāh – d. 95AH) said, “The Murji’ah are the Jews of the Qiblah”1 [AsSunnah – ‘Abdullāh Ibn al-Imām Ahmad].\nIbrāhīm  an-Nakha’ī  (rahimahullāh  –  d.  96AH) said,  “I  fear  the  fitnah  of  the  Murji’ah  for  this Ummah more than the fitnah of the Azāriqah [a sect of the Khawārij]” [As-Sunnah – ‘Abdullāh Ibn al-Imām Ahmad].\nHe also said, “I fear the Murji’ah for the people of Islam more than their number of the Azāriqah” [As-Sunnah – ‘Abdullāh Ibn al-Imām Ahmad].\nHe  also  said,  “In  my  opinion,  the  Khawārij  are more excused than the Murji’ah” [As-Sunnah – ‘Abdullāh Ibn al-Imām Ahmad].\nHe  also  said,  “The  Murji’ah  left  the  religion flimsier than a very thin garment” [As-Sunnah – ‘Abdullāh Ibn al-Imām Ahmad].\nHe also said, “The Murji’ah invented an opinion, so I fear them for the Ummah. The evil from them is great, so be very wary of them” [Ash-Sharī’ah – Al-Ājurrī].\nHe  also  said,  “I  don’t  know  of  a  more  foolish people  by  way  of  their  opinion  than  these Murji’ah”  [As-Sunnah  –  ‘Abdullāh  Ibn  al-Imām Ahmad].\nMujāhid (rahimahullāh – d. 104AH) said, “They \n40 FEATURE\nstart  off  as  Murji’ah,  then  become  Qadariyyah [those  who  deny  the  Qadar],  then  turn  into Majūs [fire-worshippers]” [Al-Lālikā’ī].\nQatādah  (rahimahullāh  –  d.  118AH)  and  Yahyā Ibn  Abī  Kathīr  (rahimahullāh  –  d.  129AH)  both said, “There is no deviance more feared by us for the  Ummah  than  Irjā’”  [As-Sunnah  –  ‘Abdullāh Ibn al-Imām Ahmad].\nMuhammad Ibn ‘Alī Ibn al-Husayn (rahimahullāh – d. 118AH) said, “There is nothing in day or night more similar to the Jews than the Murji’ah” [AlLālikā’ī].______________1  The  Murji’ah  invented  a  religion  whose  followers  expect  to  enter  Jannah  while completely abandoning the essential deeds of Īmān (the four pillars of Islam after the testimony of faith) and claiming to affirm its words! Accordingly, they are similar to the deluded Jews who {believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part} [Al-Baqarah: 85] and say, {“We hear and disobey”} [Al-Baqarah: 93], yet they declare, {“Never will the Fire touch us except for a few days”} [Al-Baqarah: 80] and {“We will be forgiven”} [Al-A’rāf:  169].  The  Salaf  also  compared  Irjā’  to  Christianity,  as  some  of  them  were reported to have said, “Be wary of Irjā’ for it is an aspect of Christianity” [Al-Lālikā’ī]. This is because the Christians, like the Jews, claim salvation is attainable by mere words with absolutely no deeds to back those words; Allah (ta’ālā) responded to the Jews by saying, {Say, “Have you taken a covenant with Allah? For Allah will never break His covenant. Or do you say about Allah that which you do not know?” Yes, whoever earns evil and his sin has encompassed him – those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally. But they who believe and do righteous deeds – those are the companions of Paradise;  they will  abide  therein  eternally}  [Al-Baqarah:  80-82]. He (ta’ālā)  responded to the Christians as well as the Jews by saying, {And they say, “None will enter Paradise except  one  who  is  a  Jew  or  a  Christian.”  That  is  [merely]  their  wishful  thinking,  Say, “Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.” Yes on the contrary, whoever submits his face in Islam to Allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve} [Al-Baqarah: 111-112]. See also Sūrat an-Nisā’, verses 123-124. The Jews and Christians both declared that the mere claim of faith in their messengers was sufficient to save them from Hellfire while they abandoned the essential implications of this faith, which was for them to follow the final Prophet Muhammad (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) in both words and deeds, as he was prophesized in their scriptures. Finally, Allah’s mercy and forgiveness is not an excuse to commit sins and injustices never mind shirk and kufr!\n\fsee  this  group  as  an  Islamic  group, and it’s an Islamic terrorist group but it’s a terrorist group that has become a  nation-state.  And it’s  accepted broadly in these areas by individuals now that refuse to accept the concept of secular nation-states. And ISIS has been  brilliant  in  its  pushing  out  of propaganda.  It  has  really  sold  itself to the hundreds of millions of people around  there  that  are  looking  for  a message.”\nFinally,  the  American  crusader  and Virginia  state  senator  Richard  Black said the following:\n“One thing is clear, if Damascus falls, the  dreaded  black  and  white  flag  of ISIS  will  fly  over  Damascus.  Within a  period  of  months  after  the  fall  of Damascus, Jordan will fall and Lebanon will fall. With that area of expansion for the most extreme Islamists, I think you will automatically see a beginning of  a  historic  push  of  Islam  towards Europe and I think, ultimately, Europe will  be  conquered,  and  that’s  why  I look at Syria as the center of gravity. That’s what we used to talk about in the army war college when we would study  wars  and  the  objective.  There was  always  a  center  of  gravity  –  the thing  which  would  determine  the outcome  of  the  war.  If  you  defeated the  center  of  gravity,  then  you  won. What  I  see  is  Syria  is  the  center  of gravity  for  Western  civilization.  If  it falls, then we will begin to see a very rapid  advance  of  Islam  on  Europe and I think ultimately, potentially, the collapse of all of Europe.”\n58 ENEMY‘S WORDS\nThe American Crusader RICHARD BLACK\n\f"

Let me explain the actions we are taking and why. First, I  said  in  June,  as  the  terrorist  group  ISIL  began  an advance across Iraq, that the United States would be prepared  to  take  targeted  military  action  in  Iraq  if and when we determined that the situation required it. In recent days, these terrorists have continued to move across Iraq and have neared the city of Irbil, where American diplomats and civilians serve at our consulate,  and  American  military  personnel  advise Iraqi forces. To stop the advance on Irbil, I’ve directed our military to take targeted strikes against ISIL terrorist convoys should they move toward the city. We intend to stay vigilant and take action if these terrorist  forces  threaten  our  personnel  or  facilities anywhere in Iraq, including our consulate in Irbil and our embassy in Baghdad. We’re also providing urgent assistance  to  Iraqi  government  and  Kurdish  forces so they can more effectively wage the fight against ISIL. Second, at the request of the Iraqi government, we’ve begun operations to help save Iraqi civilians stranded  on  the  mountain.  As  ISIL  has  marched across Iraq it has waged a ruthless campaign against innocent Iraqis. And these terrorists have been especially  barbaric  towards  religious  minorities,  including  Christians  and  Yazidis,  a  small  and  ancient religious sect. Countless Iraqis have been displaced and chilling reports describe ISIL militants rounding up  families,  conducting  mass  executions,  and  enslaving Yazidi women. In recent days, Yazidi women, men, and children from the area of Sinjar have fled for their lives. And thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, are now hiding high up in the mountain with little but the clothes on their backs. They’re without food. They’re without water. People are starving and children are dying of thirst. Meanwhile, ISIL forces below have called for the systematic destruction of the entire Yazidi people below which would constitute genocide…\n”\ndabiq\fsteven JoeLsotLoff\ndefeated US government turned away from their citizen with apathy.\nthe Islamic State for the safe release of American citizens?\nDuring this long 9-month period, as the American government was dragging its feet, reluctant to take the necessary steps to save James’s life, negotiations were made by the governments of a number of European prisoners, which resulted in the release of a dozen of their prisoners, after the demands of the Islamic State were met. That left a number of British and American prisoners remaining in the cells of the Islamic State, only after  their  governments  arrogantly  refused  to release our imprisoned brothers and our sister, Dr. Aafia Siddiqui. \nTo paraphrase James, the Obama administration ultimately hit the last nail in James’s coffin and killed him by bombing Iraq. A message was sent two days before James’s execution, warning of his demise as a result of the US airstrikes in Iraq. The solution was easy… Stop the airstrikes!\nThe arrogant US government paid no attention to  the  offer  nor  to  the  threats  that  accompanied it, so the question that every rational person needs to ask is what is the real reason behind  the  Obama  administration’s  refusal to comply with the demands put forward by \nThe answer is that Obama now blindly follows the example of “the war president” Bush. He will continue  to  strengthen  the  ancient  and  historical enemy of the West – Persia/Iran. He sends comforting signals to the agents of the Iranian government in Syria and Lebanon (al-Asad and Hezbollah).  Through  his  decisions,  he  solidifies the  Iranian  puppet  government  in  Iraq  as  well as the Iranian-backed Shiite militias allied to the puppet government. \nHe supports the Shiite allies of Iran in Afghanistan. He strikes the mujāhidīn – the true enemies of the Shia in Yemen – and thus emboldens the Houthi agents of Iran. He does all this more  foolishly  than  Bush,  for  Iran  is  a  key  ally of Russia, another historical enemy of the West, currently battling Western allies in the Ukraine and elsewhere! And to achieve these goals, he sacrifices the welfare of the American public for the  sake  of  “the  chosen  few”  benefitting  from Zionism  and  capitalism,  as  America  faces  crisis after  crisis  including  earthquakes  in  California, protests in Missouri, and the potential deaths of American prisoners held by the Islamic State…\ndabiq\f"

In  “2003,”  the  crusaders  then  launched  a  second campaign  known  as  “Operation  Iraqi  Freedom.”  This was followed by a third campaign known as “Operation Inherent Resolve” launched in “2014” in both Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State.2  None of these various campaigns were successful in preventing the revival of the Khilāfah nor its continuity nor its expansion. Rather it was the Khilāfah that endured with inherent resolve, a result of its tawhīd and walā’ and barā’.\nThe  new  crusader  coalition  for  Iraq  and  Syria  – “Operation  Inherent  Resolve”  –  officially  includes  the following countries and entities: \nAlbania,  the  Arab  League,  Australia,  Austria,  Bahrain, Belgium,  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina,  Bulgaria,  Canada, Croatia,  Cyprus,  Czech  Republic,  Denmark,  Egypt, Estonia, the European Union, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany,  Greece,  Hungary,  Iceland,  Iraq,  Ireland, Italy,  Japan,  Jordan,  Kosovo,  Kuwait,  Latvia,  Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxembourg,  Macedonia,  Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, The Netherlands, New Zealand, \n2 Note: The various campaign names are those given to the operation by the Americans.

Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Mongolia, as well as many nations mentioned in the “Operation Inherent Resolve” list – including Turkey – are members of this NATO crusader campaign known as “Operation Resolute Support.” As for Pakistan, then it is a close ally of the United States in the war against Wilāyat Khurāsān.\ndabiq\n\fstream of volunteers — with the aid of IS logistics units in Turkey, Greece, Spain, and Italy — to fight with IS forces  in  Syria  and  Iraq.

While its fighters defend and slowly expand IS-held  territory,  other  IS  leaders and  administrators  are  engaged  in bringing  order  and  repairing  social services  and  public  utilities  in  the areas  they  hold,  a  pattern  seen previously in Syria and Iraq.

Libya  also  gives  IS  crossborder access to Niger and Chad, both of which facilitate direct contact with IS’s  expanding  Nigerian  ally  Boko Haram.  In  addition,  Niger  affords easy entry into Mali where desperate Islamist  organizations  might  well be  enticed  to  cooperate  with  IS  so as to benefit from its military know how,  reputation  for  success,  ample treasury,  and  the  return  of  veteran Malian  mujahedin  who  have  been fighting  with  IS  in  Syria,  Iraq,  and Libya.\n3)  Afghanistan:  IS’s  presence in Afghanistan is just a year old but its fighters  are  reported  to  be  deployed in more than half of the country’s 34 provinces, in and near the capital of Kabul, and in Pakistan’s tribal region, Baluchistan Province, and the city of Karachi.

The  Saudi-led  effort3  has  not  yet made the Balkans a bastion of those doctrines, but it is yielding increasing numbers  of  Balkan  Muslims  who have  become  Salafis  and  Wahhabis. These  converts  have  challenged in and succeeded in displacing  more  moderate Islamic leaders,  building  Islamist organizations  that  have  sporadically attacked  individuals,  security  forces, and buildings, and have sent a steady 2  Editor’s  Note:  The  tawāghīt  of  Āl  Salūl  and  their  allies work together to portray themselves as the caretakers of Islam and the Muslims, when in actuality they propagate deviance, lewdness, and even sodomy through their “Rotana Group” and their other entertainment and religious outlets, never mind the fact they rule by international and domestic manmade laws and support the Jews and Christians against Islam and the Muslims. Their weak and hypocritical support of “da’wah” – in many cases – backfired and led to people studying the Qur’ān and the Sunnah, adopting tawhīd and sharī’ah, and declaring takfīr and jihād against the very forces and agents of Āl Salūl.3 Editor’s Note: See previous footnote.\nseveral  cases \n\f"

We congratulate the Muslims and our mujāhid brothers  in  West  Africa  on  their  pledge  of allegiance,  and  we  congratulate  them  on joining the caravan of the Khilāfah. So rejoice, O Muslims, for this is a new door that Allah, the Mighty  and  Majestic,  has  opened  so  that  you may  migrate  to  the  land  of  Islam  and  so  that \nyou  may  wage  jihād.

The condition of the mujāhidīn in West Africa was a condition of unity upon tawhīd, which saw them rallying behind one leader from amongst them to wage war  against  kufr  and  implement  the  Sharī’ah in  their  land.

Shaykh ‘Abdul-Karīm al-Humayd (may Allah keep him  firm  and  release  him  from  imprisonment) wrote  an  excellent  treatise  titled  “Al-Mashāyikh al-Judud  wa  Da’watuhum  ilal  Mubāhalah”  (The New Mashāyikh and Calling Them to Mubāhalah) in which he clarified the proofs for the matter and called the so-called “Committee of Elder Scholars” as well as Salmān al-‘Awdah and Nāsir al-‘Umar to a mubāhalah, after they repeatedly labelled the mujāhidīn “khawārij” and invited the Palestinians to participate in the shirkī religion of democracy by voting for Hamas! The following discussion on mubāhalah is mostly taken from his treatise.\nThe main proof for the legality of mubāhalah is the verses: {Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created Him from dust; then He said to him, “Be,” and he was. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters. Then whoever argues with you about it after knowledge has come to you – say, “Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women,  ourselves  and  yourselves,  then  supplicate earnestly and invoke the curse of Allah upon the liars”} [Āl ‘Imrān: 59-61].\nThese  verses  were  revealed  with  regards  to  a christian  delegation  from  Najrān  that  came  to the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and debated him on Islam. When mubāhalah was proposed, the christian delegation backed out.\nAllah ‘azza wa jall also said, {Say, “Whoever is in error – let ar-Rahmān lengthen for him an extension [in time] until, when they see that which they were promised – either punishment or the Hour.” They will come to know who is worst in position \nand weaker in soldiers”} [Maryam: 75].\nIbn  Kathīr  (rahimahullāh)  said  –  commenting  on the verse, “Allah ta’ālā says, {Say}, O Muhammad to these mushrikīn who associate others with their Lord, who claim that they are upon the  truth and that you are upon falsehood. \n{Whoever is in error}, meaning from amongst us and amongst you. {Let ar-Rahmān lengthen for him an extension} meaning, that Allah leaves him in his condition,  until  he  meets  his  Lord  and  his  term elapses.  {Either  punishment}  afflicts  him,  {or  the Hour} comes to him suddenly. {They will come to know} then, {who is worst in position and weaker in soldiers}, meaning in contrast to their claim of good position and assembly.”\n“Mujāhid said regarding His words: {Let ar-Rahmān lengthen  for  him  an  extension},  ‘Let  Allah  leave him in his tyranny.’ This is what Abu Ja’far Ibn Jarīr at-Tabarī (rahimahullāh) ascertained.”\n“This  is  the  mubāhalah  for  the  mushrikīn  who claim  that  they  are  upon  guidance  with  regards to  their  religion,  as  Allah  ta’ālā  also  mentioned the mubāhalah for the jews in His words,  {Say, “O you who are jews, if you claim that you are allies of Allah, excluding the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful”} [Al-Jumu’ah: 6], meaning supplicate for death to befall the one upon falsehood amongst us or amongst you; if you claim that you are upon truth, then du’ā’ cannot harm you.

Numerous responded positively,  extending  their  hands  and declaring  their  oaths.  Finally,  upon hearing of Shaykh Abū Talhah’s presence in Adhān, the Deobandi partisans of the Taliban in the region set up roadblocks and  checkpoints,  preventing  him  from leaving  the  village  until  an  American airstrike  killed  him  along  with  five  of his  companions  on  Monday  21  Rabī’ al-Ākhir.  Shaykh  Abū  Talhah  thereby attained shahādah at the age of 45 after a  life  of  jihād,  hisbah,  and  da’wah.  We consider him such and Allah is his judge. May Allah have mercy upon him and his companions in martyrdom.\nSHAYKH ABŪ TALHAH (MAY ALLAH ACCEPT HIM)\nas a field commander and proved extremely capable, and as a result he was once again appointed as a wālī, this  time  over  three  wilāyāt.  He  again  placed  focus on calling to tawhid and, as a result, was once more dismissed from his position as wālī, going back to being a field commander once again.\nShaykh  Abū  Talhah  had  long  dreamed  of  seeing  the re-establishment  of  the  Khilāfah,  as  did  many  of  the mujāhidīn who were fighting to achieve that very goal so  that  the  Ummah’s  glory  would  return.  When  the Khilāfah was announced, he was from amongst those brothers who eagerly hastened to declare their bay’ah and join the caravan of the Khilāfah. He alongside his brothers in Khurāsān presented what was required of \nTHE WĀLĪ SHAYKH HĀFIDH SA’ĪD KHĀN (HAFIDHAHULLĀH) PROMISES REVENGE FOR THE KILLING OF SHAYKH ABŪ TALHAH (RAHIMAHULLĀH)\ndabiq\n\fwill say, “In what [condition] were you?” They will say, “We were oppressed in the land.” The angels  will  say,  “Was  not  the  earth  of  Allah spacious [enough] for you to emigrate therein?” For those, their refuge is Hell – and evil it is as a destination} [An-Nisā’: 97].\nIbn  Kathīr  (rahimahullāh)  said,  “The  āyah indicates  the  general  obligation  of  hijrah.  So everyone  who  lives  amongst  the  mushrikīn while being able to perform hijrah and not being able to establish his religion, then he is wronging himself and committing sin. This is in accordance with  ijmā’.  Abū  Dāwūd  reported  through  his isnād on the authority of Samurah Ibn Jundub (radiyallāhu ‘anhumā) that Rasūlullāh (sallallāhu ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  said,  ‘Whoever  gathers  and lives with the mushrik, then he is like him.’”\nAlso, if there were no evidences for the obligation of  hijrah  except  the  following  ahādīth  of  the Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam),  “Hijrah will  not  cease  as  long  as  there  is  repentance, and  repentance  will  not  cease  until  the  sun rises from the West” [Reported by Abū Dāwūd], “Hijrah will not cease as long as there is jihād” [Reported by Imām Ahmad], “I have nothing to do  with  any  Muslim  who  resides  amongst  the mushrikīn”  [Reported  by  Abū  Dāwūd  and  atTirmidhī], and, “Hijrah will not cease as long as the enemy is fought” [Reported by Imām Ahmad and an-Nasā’ī], it would suffice us to refute the doubts of the doubters and the rumors of the fearmongers.\nTHE TWIN HALVES OF THE MUHĀJIRĪN\nThis ruling is an obligation upon women just as  it  is  upon  men,  for  Allah  (ta’ālā),  when excluding those incapable of performing hijrah, He excluded the incapable women just as He excluded  the  incapable  men.  Allah  (ta’ālā) said,  {Except  for  the  oppressed  among  men, women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to a way – for those it is expected that Allah will pardon them, and Allah  is  ever  Pardoning  and  Forgiving}  [AnNisā’:  98-99].  The  Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi wa sallam) has also said, “Women are the twin halves of men” [Reported by Abū Dāwūd, atTirmidhī, and Ibn Mājah].\nAnd  today,  after  the  Muslims  established  a state that rules by the Qur’ān and the Sunnah of  the  Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam), which expanded to wide territories larger than the areas of some of the states of Sykes and Picot,  and  whose  blessed  soldiers  restored the  promised  khilāfah  by  the  edge  of  the sword not through pacifism, the rate of hijrah magnified  and  now  every  day  there  are  not only  muhājirīn  to  the  land  of  Islam  but  also muhājirāt  who  were  sick  of  living  amongst kufr and its people. As soon as the sun of their awaited  state  rose,  they  rushed  to  it  alone and  in  groups  from  the  eastern and  western extents of the Earth. Their colors and tongues are different, but their hearts are united upon “there is no god but Allah.” I remember the day I performed hijrah, I was the only Arab woman amongst the muhājirah sisters during that trip.\nIf  speaking  about  the  muhājirīn  is  amazing, then  speaking  about  their  twin  halves  the muhājirāt  is  even  more  amazing!  How  many stories  have  I  heard  which  I  would  not  have believed if not for hearing them directly from the mouths of those sisters involved or seeing these  sisters  with  my  own  eyes;  otherwise, I  would  have  thought  them  the  product  of imagination or something impossible!\nThe  opponents  often  repeat  that  those  who perform hijrah to the Islamic State belong to \ndabiq\n\f"

Therefore, abandoning jihād is a trait of hypocrisy. So be wary of it or else it may seize you by your heart.\nAl-Hasan  al-Basrī  (rahimahullāh)  said,  “No  one fears  hypocrisy  except  a  believer,  and  no  one feels safe from it except a hypocrite” [Jāmi’ al-‘Ulūm wal-Hikam].\nIbn  Rajab  (rahimahullāh)  said,  “Sahl  at-Tustarī said, ‘The murīd (devout worshipper) fears being afflicted with sins, but the ‘ārif (knowledgeable  slave)  fears  being  afflicted  with  kufr.’  For this reason the Sahābah and the righteous Salaf after them were afraid of nifāq (hypocrisy) for themselves,  and  their  worry  of  nifāq  was  severe. Therefore, the believer is afraid of minor nifāq for himself, and he is afraid that such could overcome him prior to death and thus drive him into major nifāq, as we mentioned before that deeply  hidden  evils  bring  about  sinful  death” [Jāmi’ al-‘Ulūm wal-Hikam].\ndabiq\f“\nToday I authorized two operations in Iraq – targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians  who  are  trapped  on  a  mountain  without food and water, and facing almost certain death. Let me explain the actions we are taking and why. First, I  said  in  June,  as  the  terrorist  group  ISIL  began  an advance across Iraq, that the United States would be prepared  to  take  targeted  military  action  in  Iraq  if and when we determined that the situation required it. In recent days, these terrorists have continued to move across Iraq and have neared the city of Irbil, where American diplomats and civilians serve at our consulate,  and  American  military  personnel  advise Iraqi forces. To stop the advance on Irbil, I’ve directed our military to take targeted strikes against ISIL terrorist convoys should they move toward the city. We intend to stay vigilant and take action if these terrorist  forces  threaten  our  personnel  or  facilities anywhere in Iraq, including our consulate in Irbil and our embassy in Baghdad. We’re also providing urgent assistance  to  Iraqi  government  and  Kurdish  forces so they can more effectively wage the fight against ISIL. Second, at the request of the Iraqi government, we’ve begun operations to help save Iraqi civilians stranded  on  the  mountain.  As  ISIL  has  marched across Iraq it has waged a ruthless campaign against innocent Iraqis. And these terrorists have been especially  barbaric  towards  religious  minorities,  including  Christians  and  Yazidis,  a  small  and  ancient religious sect. Countless Iraqis have been displaced and chilling reports describe ISIL militants rounding up  families,  conducting  mass  executions,  and  enslaving Yazidi women. In recent days, Yazidi women, men, and children from the area of Sinjar have fled for their lives. And thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, are now hiding high up in the mountain with little but the clothes on their backs. They’re without food. They’re without water. People are starving and children are dying of thirst. Meanwhile, ISIL forces below have called for the systematic destruction of the entire Yazidi people below which would constitute genocide…\n”\ndabiq\f"

But  destroying  ISIS,  even  in a  couple  of  years,  is  just  not  possible.  If  we  succeed  in dismantling ISIS, we’re still left with a really problematic region.\nRobinson:  This  kind  of  partnered  counterterrorism  approach that the president has been talking about requires really refining how America deals with its partners. In this case,  every  partner  is  problematic.  Iraqi  security  forces have  crumbled  in  recent  months.  The  Shia  militias  are problematic.  The  Sunnis  could  potentially  turn  against ISIS, but they are very wary of this new government. The Peshmurgas, the Kurdish militia, are least problematic. Finally, the Syrian opposition is terribly weak.\nConnable: I’m not sure anybody has a clear understanding of who’s who in Syria. Identities and loyalties shift. I don’t think it’s going to cripple the strategy, but it is a serious  hurdle. The absence of a clearly envisioned end state condition is important. What is it that we want this group that we’re going to support to do after ISIS is defeated? The Free Syrian Army is the group we go to now. They’ve suffered battlefield defeats. They’re politically disorganized. I’m not sure what they would do with the Syrian state if they were able to assume control. \nLiepman: We need to remind ourselves that the president said, as did his military commanders, that this new phase of fighting against a determined and impressive enemy, will  take  some  time.  We  need  to  be  careful  about  how we define victory. We won’t vanquish this enemy. We’ll be lucky to degrade ISIS. We need patience. \nRabasa: I’m afraid we may have fallen into ISIS’s trap. We probably had no choice but to extend the airstrikes into Syria, since that is ISIS’s base of operations. But by doing so we have escalated the campaign against ISIS without deploying sufficient force to seriously degrade or destroy them. \nRabasa:  Airstrikes  will  have  diminishing  returns  as  ISIS adjusts. And standing up to the United States is likely to enhance its image among both jihadi and non-jihadi constituencies. Like all irregular forces facing a stronger adversary, it wins if it does not lose.\nTHE ENEMY’S WORDS\n”\n\fIF I WERE THE US PRESIDENT TODAY…\nIn Australia, Numan Haider stabbed two counterterrorism police officers. In Canada, a soldier  was  shot  and  killed  in  front  of  the  war memorial  in  Ottawa  by  32  year-old  Michael Zehaf-Bibeau on October 22nd, who then entered Canada’s parliamentary building looking for  other  targets  before  himself  being  shot and killed by police. In the same week another two soldiers were run over in a hit-and-run in Quebec by Martin Couture-Rouleau and in New  York,  Zale  Thompson  attacked  four  policemen  in  Queens  with  a  hatchet,  the  moment  of  his  savage  attack  caught  on  CCTV cameras and beamed into people’s homes all across America.\nwere to rise up and fight the enemies of the Islamic State that brought almost instant reaction from around the world. \n“Do not let this battle pass you by wherever you may be,” commanded the Shaykh.\n“You must strike the soldiers, patrons, and troops of the tawāghīt. Strike their police, security, and intelligence members. If you can kill a disbelieving American or European – especially the spiteful and filthy French – or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be.”\nAnd  so  it  began.  Just  days  later,  chaos  erupted around the world. \n \nMARTIN COUTURE-ROULEAU (RAHIMAHULLĀH)\nAll these attacks were the direct result of the Shaykh’s  call  to  action,  and  they  highlight what a deadly tinderbox is fizzing just beneath the surface of every western country, waiting to explode into violent action at any moment given the right conditions. Suddenly the mujāhidīn of the Islamic State weren’t some esoteric concept fighting in a land nobody knew or cared about, they were on the doorstep of millions  of  people  living  in  some  of  the  biggest, most modern cities in the western world. The  attacks  served  as  a  damning  indictment of America’s continued policy of foreign intervention. Everything the United States and its allies had been fighting for in the “war on terror,” the old “if we don’t fight them there we’ll \ndabiq\n\f"

        "@value": "who  fulfills  its  conditions  and  qualification mentioned  in  the  texts  of  the  Sharī’ah  and  the words of the scholars. The imām could be general to  all  the  Muslims,  and  he  is  called  the  general imām  or  the  khalīfah.  This  leader,  due  to  his status and the nature of his imāmah, has general influence; obedience to him is obligatory upon all the Muslims. This kind of imāmah is the default by which the obligation upon the whole Ummah to appoint a khalīfah is fulfilled and through him, the obligation is established. This is the intent of all  the  verses  and  ahādīth  that  order  and  guide towards  appointing  an  imām  and  khalīfah,  like the  hadith,  “Then  there  will  be  khilāfah  upon the  prophetic  methodology,”  and  the  hadīth narrated by Hudhayfah  “Stick to the jamā’ah of the Muslims and their imām,” and the hadith “If bay’ah is given to two khulafā’, then kill the second of the two,” and the other texts that are about  the  rules  regarding  the  general  imām  or khalīfah  who  deserves  this  description  having fulfilled the conditions and qualifications for it, as in the case of the khilāfah of the four Rightly Guided Khulafā’, as well as al-Hasan Ibn ‘Alī Ibn Abī Tālib, Mu’āwiyah Ibn Abī Sufyān, ‘Abdullāh Ibn az-Zubayr  and the khilafah of ‘Umar Ibn ‘Abdil-‘Azīz r, and others [from the Umawī and ‘Abbāsī khulafā’].\nAnd it might be the case that the imām or amīr is specific to some region or land, then he would be  a  territorial  leader  whose  authority  does  not exceed his territory, as the historians mentioned that  when  the  khalīfah  of  the  time  Mu’āwiyah Ibn Yazīd died in 64AH, the people of Damascus appointed ad-Dahhāk Ibn Qays as a leader to look after their affairs until the general imām is given bay’ah.  This  kind  of  leadership  is  not  allowed except in cases of necessity and when the general imāmah  is  dissolved.  This  is  done  to  fill  the political and shar’ī gap and to establish whatever is  possible  from  the  laws  of  the  Sharī’ah.  Many scholars  of  shar’ī  governance  have  mentioned such  appointments  in  such  situations,  like  alJuwaynī  in  his  prized  book  “Giyāth  al-Umam,” in which he said, “The purpose of imāmah is the betterment of the condition of the general public, planning the affairs, and protecting the frontiers.”\n“Therefore,  if  appointing  a  single  imām  whose orders  are  executed  is  possible,  then  there  is  no doubt  that  this  is  best  in  accordance  with  the requisites  of  governance.  If  this  is  not  possible, it is not correct to leave and neglect the people whom the imām’s supervision does not reach, as there  will  be  no  leader  to  gather  them  nor  any deterrent  to  prevent  them  from  evil.  So  they have to appoint ministers to whom they turn for leadership.  If  they  remain  leaderless,  they  will perish, and this is obvious and unpreventable.”\nIf not for the absence of the Khilāfah before, there would  not  have  been  a  shar’ī  justification  for those territorial leaderships or small groups to be formed and remain. Accordingly, it is obligatory to  appoint  a  single  imām  and  khalīfah  for  the Ummah who will govern the people in accordance with  Allah’s  religion  and  make  them  follow  the laws  of  the  Sharī’ah.  This  is  because  khilāfah  is similar to the case of water for wudū’, which is the  default,  and  those  territorial  leaderships  are like tayammum, which is an alternative allowed when necessary. And when the default is available, the  alternative  is  unaccepted.  Therefore,  when the  khalīfah  is  appointed,  all  other  pledges  of allegiance  and  leaderships  outside  of  it  become void. That is why al-Juwaynī said after his above statement, “If the obstacles are removed and the imām is able to supervise those people, the leader and his subjects must obey the imām and submit to  him  in  peace.  The  imām  should  accept  their excuses  and  govern  their  affairs.  If  he  decides to  approve  the  appointment  of  whom  they  had appointed, he can do so. And if he sees it best to change  him,  then  his  opinion  is  to  be  followed and they must return to his decision.”\nIf this is understood and the difference between these  realities  becomes  obvious,  the  answer  to the  question  posed  becomes  clear  through  the just  and  precise  description  of  the  imāmah  of Shaykh  Abū  Bakr  al-Husaynī  al-Baghdādī  and the leadership of Mullā ‘Umar, since one cannot decide  on  a  matter  until  the  whole  picture  is understood.  Accordingly, the  declarations, statements,  conducts,  and  nature  of  Mullā ‘Umar’s leadership shows without a doubt that it \ndabiq\n\fThe  Expeditions  the  Prophet  Dispatched  in Ramadān\nThe  definition  of  a  ghazwah  is  a  battle  in  which the Prophet  went out with his companions and himself led the battle. A sariyyah on the other hand is one he was not present in and did not lead. The total  number  of  sarāyā  he  dispatched  was  73,  11 of which were sent out in the month of Ramadān. These 11 are the following:\n1) The Sariyyah of Sāhil al-Bahr: This occurred in the Ramadān of the first year after the Hijrah. It was  the  first  expedition  dispatched  in  Islam.  The Prophet    appointed  Hamzah    as  its  leader and  sent  him  with  30  men  from  the  Muhājirīn. They went out to face a trade caravan belonging to Quraysh that had come from Shām. They reached Sīf Al-Bahr, an area on the coast of the Red Sea, facing  the  kuffar  and  preparing  rows  for  battle. Majdī Ibn ‘Amr al-Juhanī who was an ally of both sides, came between the two sides and as a result they did not fight.\n2) The Sariyyah of ‘Umayr Ibn ‘Adī al-Khitmī: This occurred in the Ramadān of the second year after the Hijrah. The Prophet  dispatched this expedition to  kill  ‘Asmā’  Bint  Marwān,  a  woman  who  used to insult Islam and incite against the Prophet . ‘Umayr Ibn ‘Adīy al-Khitmī came to her house at night and placed his sword on her chest, applying pressure until he had carried it through to her back.\n3)  The  Sariyyah  of  Zayd  Ibn  Hārithah:  In  the Ramadān  of  the  sixth  year  after  the  Hijrah,  the Prophet    dispatched  an  expedition  for  Banū Fazārah in a region of al-Qurā Valley. The reason was that men from Banū Fazārah had intercepted a trade caravan belonging to the Muslims and looted it. Zayd Ibn Hārithah left for them while heading a troop of the Prophet’s companions. They reached them in the morning and surrounded them and took Umm Qirfah Fātimah Bint Rabī’ah al-Fazāriyyah. She  was  an  old  woman  venerated  and  obeyed  by her people. She had prepared 40 cavaliers from her sons and her son’s sons to kill the Prophet . The noble companion Zayd Ibn Hārithah killed them all including Umm Qirfah.\n4) The Sariyyah of ‘Abdullāh Ibn ‘Atīk: This occurred in the Ramadān of the sixth year after the Hijrah. The tribes of al-‘Aws and Khazraj used to compete in  their  defense  of  the  Prophet  .  So  when  the ‘Aws killed Ka’b Ibn al-Ashraf, who used to cause the  Prophet    harm,  the  Khazraj  searched  for someone who was similar to him in opposition to the Messenger of Allah  . They found their target in Abū Rāfi’ Salām Ibn Abī Haqīq an-Nadrī. He was the one who gathered the parties on the day of the Khandaq (Trench) and prepared the Ghatafān tribe to fight the Messenger of Allah . He would also disparage Allah’s Messenger  in the various gatherings. The Khazraj from the Sahābah sought permission from the Prophet  to kill Abū Rāfi’. He gave them permission so they sent five of their members  with  ‘Abdullah  Ibn  ‘Atīk  leading  them. The sariyyah raided the house of Abū Rāfi’, killed him, and returned.\n5) The Sariyyah of Ghālib al-Laythī: In the Ramadān of the seventh year after the Hijrah, the Prophet  sent this detachment to Banū ‘Uwāl and to Banū ‘Abd Ibn Tha’labah, two tribes from the Bedouins of Najd. The men of the two tribes used to conduct raids  on  the  outskirts  of  al-Madīnah  whilst  the Muslims  were  pre-occupied  with  their  battles against Quraysh and the Jews. Under the leadership of Ghālib al-Laythī, 130 fighters from the Muslims marched towards them. They attacked them at the time of Fajr and killed everyone who stood against them.  The  remaining  fled.  They  seized  livestock and sheep from them which they took back to alMadīnah.\n6)  The  Sariyyah  of  Abū  Qatādah  as-Salamī:  This occurred in the Ramadān of the eighth year after the Hijrah. This was at the time that the Prophet  contemplated attacking Makkah. He sent Abū Qatādah  as-Salamī  with  8  others  to  Batn  Idam (a valley north of Makkah). This was in order to trick Quraysh with regards to the true goal of the Muslims, and make them think that the Muslims were  targeting  that  area  and  not  Makkah.  The sariyyah reached the target without facing anything and so departed, joining up with the Muslim army.\n7)  The  Sariyyah  of  Khālid  Ibn  al-Walīd:  This \ndabiq\n\f"

Then the conquests expanded in the east, thus  ‘Irāq  was  liberated  in  Mosul, al-Anbar,  al-Fallūjah,  Salāhuddīn, Karkūk  and  elsewhere.  And  its soldiers continue to hope for Allah’s further  support  and  the  conquest of Constantinople and Rome.\nCoalition  and  its  councils  to  fail.  It  conquered some of the towns and villages in Shām, like al-Bāb, I’zāz, ad-Dānā, and others which used to be ruled by the Nusayrī regime and then by the resistant parties  like  the  Free  Syrian  Army  and  its  allies who resisted the Sharī’ah and its rulings. Thus, the Islamic State ruled those towns and villages with what Allah had sent down on His Messenger , established in them the hudūd, commanded the good,  forbade  the  evil,  and  judged  between  the people by the Sharī’ah.\nTherefore,  the  groups  of  apostates,  hypocrites, innovators,  corruption  spreaders,  rebels,  and partisans  –  having  diverse  hearts  but  allied  to one  another  –  thought,  evaluated,  plotted, collaborated amongst each other, and all of them participated in the concocted treachery… A few supposedly “neutral” groups remained outside of this coalition, like a confused lamb, neither with this side nor the other, and Allah’s help is sought.\nIn  the  beginning,  the  wicked  Sahwah  Coalition in  Shām  consisted  of  “Jaysh  al-Mujāhidīn,”  the “Islamic Front,” “Jabhat Thuwār Sūriyā,” the Free Syrian Army, and the Jawlānī front.11 Entering into a coalition is by cooperating with it on its aim. It is not a condition that the party signs a membership paper to join the coalition. Also, some of the jihād claimants persist on blatantly lying, claiming that the Jawlānī front did not partake in the Sahwah. So what is then “Majlis Shūrā Mujāhidī ash-Sharqiyyah” (Mishmish)? And what is “Liwā’ Thuwwār ar-Raqqah”? (They were the Jawlānī front’s branch in Wilāyat ar-Raqqah until the 16th of Jumādā al- Ākhirah 1435, more than three months after the beginning of the Sahwah. They are the soldiers of the Syrian called “Abū Sa’d al-Hadramī.” Now they are fighting in ‘Ayn al-Islām and Tall Abyad in one rank together with the Kurdish atheists while shielded by American air cover.)\nThe Islamic State did not conquer a city or village after this malicious plot except that it ruled it by the Sharī’ah of Allah. When the parties of deviance in ar-Raqqah consisting of “Ahrār ash-Shām” and the Jawlānī front (or what is now known now as “Liwā’  Thuwwār  ar-Raqqa”)  plotted  against  the muhājirīn and ansār in it and acted treacherously against them, the muwahhid mujāhidīn expelled them  from  it,  humiliated.  Then  they  spread the  authority  of  the  Sharī’ah  over  the  complete wilāyah.  They  enforced  prayer,  collected  zakah, and founded the Hisbah to command good and forbid evil. They executed the hudūd, judged in their courts by what Allah revealed, returned the rights  of  the  oppressed,  fought  the  kuffār  and apostates,  and  enforced  the  jizyah  upon  AhlulKitāb. Thus, ar-Raqqah witnessed what it had not witnessed before from the rulings of the Sharī’ah. Likewise  was  the  case  of  the  other  cities  and Indeed all the people of Halab know the role that the Jawlānī front played in the Sahwah Coalition, since the interrogators in the Sahwāt’s prisons were security officers from the Jawlānī front. And if a muhājir wanted safety, the Sahwah Coalition used to order him to surrender himself to the Jawlānī front. And this was all done in cooperation with other factions from the Sahwah Coalition as “‘Amr al-Halabī” mentioned in the first days of the Sahwah on the Jawlānī front’s favorite TV channel: AlJazeera…One of the former members of Jawlānī’s “shūrā” council who returned to the Islamic State’s ranks informed us that Jawlānī informed them in a gathering two weeks before the launching of the Sahwah plot, that the parties had agreed upon waging war against the Islamic State soon and that he had attended the gathering in which the decision was made. When he asked Jawlānī about his front’s role in that, Jawlānī mentioned that he had pledged to cover the frontlines with the regime that would be weakened by this plot. (For details, read the interview with the brother in this issue of Dābiq.)So the wicked one knew with certainty what was concocted against the Islamic State and he promised to protect the backs of the factions, allowing them to launch their war against the Islamic State. He thereby made sure that the Jawlānī front would stay far from the foreground and thus present itself as neutral “only” defending the frontlines against the Nusayrī regime, frontlines which the Islamic State was occupied from protecting after the factions stabbed it in the back. Even the image of neutrality, he quickly cast it off and entered as a major player in the wicked Sahwah plot, as his front fought the Islamic State directly or by betraying its soldiers, luring them to imprisonment, and stripping them of their arms.\ndabiq\n\fThe City of Al-Mukalla in Yemen, where al-Qāi’dah made no effort to implement the Sharī’ah after taking over\npresence of the Jawlānī front in this coalition.  This  is  from  the  mutual “pragmatism” between the American administration  and the  Sahwah Coalition  containing  the  Jawlānī front. “Do not rule by the Sharī’ah so that  we  strike  your  enemies.”  “Halt operations  against  the  crusaders  or else we will bombard you.” It is the politics of the carrot and stick.\ntheir  brothers \nThis  might  be  the  beginning  of  the implementation of proposals made by crusader think tanks, some of which were quoted in the last issue of Dābiq, in the section titled “In the Words of the Enemy.” The matter might have depended  on  the  crusaders’  killing of leaders  in  al-Qā’idah  so  that the  organization  submits  fearfully alongside the Tālibān emirate to American politics. Now just as the Tālibān do not pose a threat towards the safety and security of the crusader homeland, al-Qā’idah no longer poses a threat. This became the case after Dhawāhirī adopted new policies opposing the policies of the mujāhid Shaykh Usāmah Ibn Lādin r. So Dhawāhirī made the crusader lands secure, the tawāghīt secure, the post-“Arab  Spring”  tawāghīt  secure, the  Ikhwānī  tawāghīt  secure,  the \nin \narmies  of  apostasy  secure,  and  the Rāfidī mobs and savages secure [As in the Jawlānī interview with AlJazeera and  as  in  “General  Guidelines  for Jihādī Action” by Dhawāhirī].\nthe \nRather  the  matter  surpassed  even this  to  the  point  that  the  “clearcut  maslahah  (interest)”  was in abandoning implementation of  the  Sharī’ah  and  its  laws!  A “pragmatic” policy, or so the crusaders claim. The New York Times also said on “9 June 2015” in an article titled “Al Qaeda Tries a New Tactic to Keep Power: Sharing It,” “After they routed the army in southern Yemen, fighters from Al Qaeda stormed into the city of  Al  Mukalla,  seizing  government buildings,  releasing  jihadists  from prison  and stealing  millions  of dollars from the central bank. Then they surprised  everyone.  Instead of  raising  their  flags  and  imposing Islamic law, they passed control to a civilian council and gave it a budget to pay salaries, import fuel and hire teams  to  clean  up  garbage.  The fighters receded into the background, maintaining  only  a  single  police station to arbitrate disputes…”\n“[The]  branches  [of  Al  Qaeda]  in \nYemen and Syria are now increasingly making  common  cause  with  local groups on the battlefield…” \n“Al  Qaeda’s  branches  in  Syria  and Yemen  have  taken  a  different  route [from  the  Islamic  State],  building ties with local groups and refraining from the strict application of Shariah, the  legal  code  of  Islam,  when  faced with  local  resistance,  according  to residents  of  areas  where  Al  Qaeda holds  sway.  When  Al  Qaeda  took over  Al  Mukalla  in  April,  it  seized government  buildings  and  used trucks  to  cart  off  more  than  $120 million from the central bank … But it  soon  passed  control  to  a  civilian council,  giving  it  a  budget  of  more than  $4  million  to  provide  services, an  arrangement  that  made  sense  to local  officials  seeking  to  serve  their people during wartime. ‘We are not Qaeda stooges,’ said Abdul-Hakeem bin Mahfood, the council’s secretary general,  in  a  telephone  interview. ‘We formed the council to avoid the destruction  of  the  city.’  While  the council  pays  salaries  and  distributes fuel,  Al  Qaeda  maintains  a  police station  to  settle  disputes,  residents said. It has so far made no effort to ban smoking or regulate how women \ndabiq\n\f"

We  wanted  to  cause chaos (tawahhush) in the lands by killing Brahmi so as to facilitate the brothers’ movements and so that we would be able to bring in weapons and liberate our brothers from prisons. This was the main goal behind killing Brahmi in addition to  the  fact  that  he  worked  in  the  Constituent Assembly making him from the tawāghīt of the country.\nDĀBIQ:  Was  it  difficult  for  you  execute  the operation?\nABŪ MUQĀTIL: All praise is due to Allah. Allah (‘azza wa jall) facilitated the matter so we did not find difficulty. We stayed four hours in front of the home of this tyrant, waiting, until he left the  home  and  entered  his  car.  I  then  moved towards  him  and  killed  him  by  shooting  ten bullets at him.\nDĀBIQ: Can you tell us about the assassination of  the  murtadd  Chokri  Belaid  (coordinator  of the  Democratic  Patriots’  Movement)  and  the \n60 INTERVIEW\nbrothers who took part in the operation?\nABŪ  MUQĀTIL:  The  assassination  of  Chokri Belaid was carried out by our brother Abū Sayyāf Kamāl  Gafgāzī  (may  Allah  accept  him).  Our brother Lutfī az-Zayn (may Allah accept him) was with him in the operation. Abū Zakariyyā Ahmad ar-Ruwaysī (may Allah accept him) helped the two  brothers  in  executing  the  operation.  Our brother  Ahmad  ar-Ruwaysī  was  killed  recently in a battle against the apostates. He had been imprisoned in Tunis for issues from his past, and alhamdulillāh,  Allah  guided  him  in  prison  and his practice became good. He began making the adhān in prison and attending the lessons given by  the  brothers  despite  the  harassment  from the tawāghīt. When the revolution happened in Tunisia, he was able to escape with the brothers from prison. He then joined the brothers in Libya and took part in some battles with the brothers. When we established a training camp in Libya, he  became  one  of  the  brothers  in  charge  of the  camp.  He  would  train  the  brothers,  as  he excelled in the military field. Thereafter, when we started smuggling arms into Tunisia, he helped us despite having a 15-year prison sentence on him  in  Tunisia.  The  brother  did  not  hesitate. He came with us, took the risk, and smuggled \nTHE MURTADD CHOKRI BELAID\n\fDempsey,  chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff, confessed  on  television  that  “firstly,  there’s  no military-only solution to ISIL. And secondly, there’s no airpower alone solution either in Iraq or Syria.”\nTHE TWO CRUSADERS HAGEL AND DEMPSEY\nThere’s  no  point  including  quotations  from  the world’s journalists because so many of them wax lyrical about the gains and exploits of the Islamic State – we’d be here all day paraphrasing other peoples’ words. \nBut  such  admissions  were  impossible  to  even imagine back in the days when American leaders were  busy  laying  the  groundwork  for  this  very environment  today.  Back  then,  it  was  all  about crushing  the  unruly  “terrorists”  in  Iraq  and Afghanistan with “shock and awe” and the might of  the  American  war  machine.  But  today  the men in charge are being forced to concede that maybe, just perhaps, they were a little too quick off the mark to dismiss the Islamic State as merely “a terrorist organization, pure and simple.” And that’s just three months into their campaign.\nI  am  certainly  no  expert  on  such  matters  and my  views  are  those  of  a  layman,  but  generally one doesn’t expect a mere “organization” to lay siege  to  cities  or  have  their  own  police  force. You certainly don’t expect a mere “organization” to  have  tanks  and  artillery  pieces,  an  army  of soldiers tens of thousands strong, and their own spy drones. And one certainly doesn’t expect a mere “organization” to have a mint with plans to \nPARADIGM SHIFT\nproduce their own currency, primary schools for the young, and a functioning court system.\nThese, surely, are all hallmarks of (whisper it if you dare) a country.\nAh,  the  C-word.  It’s  being  used  sporadically  by the media, slowly at first but its use is gathering pace. Could the Islamic State, the Caliphate that was only announced in June, really be a country?\n“ISIS will have taken more towns, more territory, consolidated  more  gains  and  really  become, unfortunately, the kind of country we don’t want to  see  over  there,”  declared  retired  Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cowan on Fox News in October 2014.\nAs uncomfortable as it may be for many in the West, there’s little reason why the State shouldn’t be considered a country. Countries can be born in days, in hours during a coup, or in minutes at the signing of a paper, they have been for centuries. So there’s no reason this one shouldn’t have been born the way it was. And if it’s not the Islamic State’s country, then just whose is it?\nCertainly, it no longer belongs to Bashar al-Asad, holed up in Damascus as his soldiers recuperate after  four  years  of  massacring  the  Muslims  of Syria.  There  was  never  any  legitimacy  to  his tyrannical rule and what control he had has long passed and can never return.\nDoes  it  then  belong  to  the  newly  instated  and incompetent  puppet  Iraqi  government,  tucked away in Baghdad while its army licks its wounds from the murderous thrashing it received from the mujāhidīn back in the summer? Clearly not. And it definitely doesn’t belong to the Free Syrian Army, who had years to do something decisive or cohesive but chose instead to smoke Gauloises cigarettes, drink tea, and complain that nothing could be done without NATO jets flying overhead. Well they are now, and they’ve still achieved zero.\nNo indeed. If anyone has an actual claim to the lands stretching across Iraq and Syria (or any of \ndabiq\n\f"

        "@value": "It’s a little weird re-visiting all of this more than a year and a half later, but it’s important to reflect on what history has clearly shown was one of the bloodiest and worst-handled hostage crises in modern times. This  was  not  just  my  observation  but  a  sentiment aired by journalists in other pieces published on the matter  subsequently.\nThe stupidity of hardline non-negotiation was obvious at the time as my cellmates were beheaded one after the other. Since most countries choose to negotiate, either above or below the table (and everyone chooses to deal below), then by being the hardliner who does not agree to talk, all you’re doing is condemning your imprisoned citizens to death. Nothing more. You’re not making a big political stand because the whole thing’s invisible and not in the media, you’re not  showing  the  world  how  tough  you  are  for  the same reasons, in fact you’re not making any difference to the global position on hostage-taking whatsoever. The captors don’t check your passport when they grab you and say, “Oh look, this one’s British. We better let him go and just keep all the French instead.” It doesn’t work like that.\nAll you’re doing is just condemning citizens who have gotten themselves into a sticky situation for the sake of a few million dollars which – let’s be honest – doesn’t go very far in today’s world. The Islamic State pumps millions of dollars a day in oil revenue so they don’t even need the proceeds from ransoms and haven’t for quite some time. I don’t claim to speak for them, but I believe it’s reasonable to say that the mujāhidīn continue to seek ransoms only to uphold an order dictated in the Qur’ān. {When you meet those \nwho  disbelieve,  strike  their  necks  until,  when  you have inflicted slaughter upon them, then secure their bonds, and either confer favor afterwards or ransom them until the war lays down its burdens} [Muhammad: 4].\nMake no mistake about it, the mujāhidīn follow the  Qur’ān  to  the  letter,  say  what  they  mean,  and mean what they say. They don’t play games, a fact that was not lost on the European countries whose citizens were prisoners. America, on the other hand, chose to glibly ignore the disaster that was coming their way and today spends more in one day of dropping bombs over the Islamic State as it would have taken to get 26 year-old Kayla Mueller home. Thanks to US policy at the time, all her family got instead was evidence that she was killed by a coalition bomb in ar-Raqqah and a candlelight vigil at their hometown of Prescott, Arizona.\nSo a few months back I watched with interest a 27-minute documentary entitled “The Cost of Living” that was aired on ABC Australia last June. The presenter of the program, Jonathan Holmes, interviewed one  of  my  former  cellmates,  Frenchman  Nicholas Henin. Nic was a peculiar fish but I rather enjoyed his company because he was quiet and said completely weird things. One of my favourite Nic-isms was when he got a sound thrashing from a guard for throwing bread down the toilet and he announced to the room in a high-pitched voice, who had just watched him sail past the door on his head before getting a pretty decent one-two in front of all of us, that “I have just been beeeeeee-ten!” Ah, such happy days.\nWhen  they  got  home  the  four  French  went  on \nNicholas Henin\n\fAttacks continue\nof its operations to other regions. The terrorist attacks carried out in the final months of 2015 demonstrate that it is capable of committing attacks on…targets outside the territories under its control. The extent of its reach was notably demonstrated by the suicide bombings in Beirut on 12 November 2015, the coordinated attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015 and the attacks in Jakarta by an ISIL affiliate on 14 January 2016, which closely resembled the Paris attacks…”\n“The recent expansion of the ISIL sphere of influence across West and North Africa, the Middle East and South and South-East Asia demonstrates  the  speed  and  scale  at  which the gravity of the threat has evolved in just 18 months. The complexity of the recent attacks and  the  level  of  planning,  coordination  and sophistication  involved  raise  concerns  about its  future  evolution.  Moreover,  other  terrorist  groups…are  sufficiently  attracted  by  its underlying  ideology  to  pledge  allegiance  to its so-called caliphate and self-proclaimed caliph. ISIL has also benefited from the arrival of a steady stream of foreign terrorist fighters, who continue to leave their communities to replenish its ranks. The return of these fighters from the battlefields of Iraq and the Syrian Arab  Republic  and  other  conflict  zones  is  a further  major  concern,  as  returnees  can  extend the presence of ISIL to their States of origin and use their skills and combat experience \nto recruit additional sympathizers, establish terrorist networks and commit terrorist acts…”\nThe report then goes on to detail how the Khilāfah implements the Sharī’ah of zakāh, da’wah, jihād, jizyah, hisbah, slavery, and hudūd – referring to all these laws with terms of mockery – and how this Sharī’ah poses a threat to “international peace and security,” AKA the “new world order.” Instead of yielding by realizing that the Khilāfah is here to stay and will continue ruling by the Sharī’ah and terrorizing its enemies, he recommended the following to the tawāghīt of the divided “United Nations”:\n“The resolution of ongoing conflicts, including the Syrian conflict, would have a direct impact on the driving forces behind the recruitment of foreign terrorist fighters by ISIL … In order to address the grave threat posed by ISIL, including the influx of foreign terrorist fighters to Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic and ISIL’s extensive financing activities, it is essential to identify a political resolution to the Syrian conflict. This process will require sustained and determined international commitment and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), which sets out a path towards formal intra-Syrian negotiations on a political transition process pursuant to the 2012 Geneva communiqué and a parallel nationwide ceasefire.”\nAnd  thus,  after  the  Riyadh  Conference  of  the  Saudi  tāghūt concluded, the Nusayriyyah and their atheist allies in the Democratic Forces of Syria – with Russian support and American consent  –  blitzkrieged  across  regions  held  by  the  murtadd  sahwāt, taking many major cities and towns through mere “negotiations” with sahwah leaders who were part of the conspiracy to achieve “a political resolution to the Syrian conflict.”\nIs it not time the naive soldiers of the sahwah realize the evil of the plot in which they have served, repent from their apostasy, and join the ranks of the Khilāfah?\n\f"

        "@value": "Christian paganism is widespread in Trinidad and Tobago\nknowledge of only the first two commandments gave me the understanding that what they were practicing was not in line with the truth. At this point, I didn’t consider myself part of any of the Christian denominations, but that was as far as I got.\nIn school, I was exposed to all the various religions but I remained upon what I knew. When I was around twenty years old, I would come to accept the religion of truth, Islam. I was working at a call center and got to  know  a  Muslim  co-worker  there.  We  happened to share many of the same worldly interests, and for this  reason,  I  would  spend  much  time  with  him.  I used to ask him many questions about the religion. In our conversations I would ask him about the beliefs of Muslims, and would also ask him about Jesus and Muhammad, and everything he told me made sense to  me  and  was  in  line  with  what  I  remembered  of the first two commandments, so I quickly gravitated towards Islam and soon found myself debating Christians because I knew their beliefs were corrupt.\nSometimes, because I was drawn to Islam, when I saw him praying, I would pray like him, and when I did, I would feel very calm afterwards. I accompanied him to the Friday sermon a couple of times to see what it was about, and then became certain that this was the true religion – the religion of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. In the last conversation we had before  I  embraced  Islam,  I  told  him  that  I  was  planning on selling drugs to support my family. He said that this was wrong and that the ends don’t justify the means. So I replied, “You tell me that in Islam I can kill people but I can’t sell drugs to feed my family?” He then began explaining to me the ultimate purpose \nof jihad as well as enlightening me concerning some of the Muslims’ plights, and after the conversation, I was settled. So I declared the testimony of faith and became a Muslim.\nDabiq: How did you find the da’wah to jihad?\nAbu Sa’d at-Trinidadi: There was a faction of Muslims in Trinidad that was known for “militancy.” Its members  attempted  to  overthrow  the  disbelieving government but quickly surrendered, apostatized, and participated in the religion of democracy, demonstrating that they weren’t upon the correct methodology of jihad. In my case, like so many other Muslims in the West, the da’wah to jihad took hold of me through the lectures of Shaykh Anwar al-‘Awlaqi . After listening  to  his  various  lectures  repeatedly,  I  gained  a firmer  understanding  of  what  we  as  Muslims  were supposed to be doing.\nI listened to his lecture series titled “Constants on the Path of Jihad” and his lecture series on “The Book of Jihad.” By Allah’s grace, there was a man of sound knowledge who I was able to refer to and who would answer  any  questions  I  had.  His  name  was  Shaykh Ashmead Choate and he had studied hadith and graduated from one of the Islamic colleges in the Middle East. He  made hijrah to the Islamic State and attained martyrdom fighting in Ramadi.\nDabiq: Tell us about your jihad endeavor in Trini-\ndad and Tobago.\nAbu Sa’d at-Trinidadi: I, along with my brothers in \n\fShaykh ‘Umar ash-Shishani \nsar” under the leadership of Shaykh ‘Umar ash-Shishani  before subsequently joining the ranks of the Islamic State a few months later, after Shaykh ‘Umar gave bay’ah to Amirul-Muminin Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi .\nWhen the two brothers initially arrived in the Levant, they were eager to do their training and head out to the battlefield. At the time, the mujahidin were preparing for a major operation in Hamah, so the two brothers headed out along with the rest of their battalion, leaving their base in ‘Anadan in the Aleppo countryside and remaining stationed in Hamah in preparation for the operation. They had to exercise patience during this period as they awaited their opportunity to  fight  and  attain  martyrdom.  For  Abu  ‘Abdillah, however, that opportunity would be delayed as he and a number of other mujahidin in their battalion were sent back to ‘Anadan to guard their base, look after the families of the mujahidin who were in Hamah, and receive any new muhajirin joining the battalion. He  gracefully  accepted  this  decision  and  reminded the brothers with him that Allah was testing their patience and that soon their opportunity to fight would come. What helped keep him firm then as well as in the  face  of  many  other  difficult  circumstances  was that  Abu  ‘Abdillah  would  regularly  recall  there  was wisdom behind Allah’s decrees.\nAs such, he remained patient even though his op-\nportunity  to  perform  ribat  (frontier  guarding)  and take part in battles against the enemies of Allah would come  much  later  due  to  his  medical  condition.  He had a blood disorder, which made it difficult for him to take part in any activities that could lead to strenuous or stressful circumstances. However, just as his brother had refused to let his asthma get in the way of fighting for the cause of Allah, so too did Abu ‘Abdillah refuse to let his condition prevent him from doing the same. They had both struggled to perform hijrah despite their conditions, and were not about to give up after reaching the point they had come to. Thus, Abu Ibrahim performed ribat and also took part in a number of battles, both in Aleppo and Hamah, and Abu ‘Abdillah waited patiently until his opportunity to perform ribat and fight finally came a few months after the start of the Sahwah in the Levant. During this period of waiting and preparation, Abu ‘Abdillah would contribute to the efforts of the mujahidin by taking on other roles.\nHis brother, having taken part in the operation in Hamah, later headed out with a group of mujahidin to join the effort to capture the city of Safirah in the Aleppo countryside from the Nusayri regime shortly before the start of the Sahwah in the Levant. He took part in a battle in the village of Tall Hasil located near Safirah and was quick to volunteer when the commander asked for a group of brothers to infiltrate \n\f"

Thus,  the  ministries  and pillars of the Rāfidī government collapsed at their blessed hands until the heroic Wālī fell into captivity.  Hudhayfah was then assigned leadership of all Baghdad as its Wālī. So he ignited it with vehicle bombs, demolishing the fortresses of the Rāfidah as well as their Safawī and Crusader masters, in  retaliation  for  the  religion  of  Allah  against  the  filthy mushrikīn and in revenge for the honor of Ahlus-Sunnah, which was desecrated at the hands of the most evil creatures to  tread  on  earth.  He  terrorized  the  Safawī  regime  and degraded it, deploying heroic soldiers armed with silencers. \nThe murtaddīn mourning the crusaders killed in the attack on the church\ndabiq\n\f"

        "@value": "victorious group – which is manifest upon the religion and not harmed by those who oppose or forsake it until the Day of Judgment – became apparent, for the people divided into three parties: A party striving in support of the religion, another forsaking it, and another outside the Sharī’ah of Islam … This test was a means of separation and division from Allah, {That Allah may reward the truthful for their truth and punish the hypocrites if He wills or accept their repentance. Indeed, Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful} [Al-Ahzāb:  24].”\nHe then mentions some āyāt about the Battle of Uhud in order to draw comparisons between the reason for the breakdown in the Muslim ranks during the Battle of Uhud, and the reason for the breakdown in the Muslim ranks during the course of the Mongol invasion. He says, “Allah said, {Indeed, those of you who turned back on the day the two armies met, it was Shaytān who caused them to slip because of some [blame] they had earned. But Allah has already forgiven them. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing} [Āl ‘Imrān: 155]. Allah c also said, {And Allah had certainly fulfilled His promise to you when you were killing the enemy by His permission until [the time] when you lost courage and fell to disputing about the order [given by the Prophet] and disobeyed after He had shown you that which you love. Among you are some who desire this world, and among you are some who desire the Hereafter. Then he turned you back from them [defeated] that He might test you. And He has already forgiven you, and Allah is the possessor of bounty for the believers} [Āl ‘Imrān: 152]. Allah also said, {Why [is it that] when a [single] disaster struck you [on the day of Uhud], although you had struck \n[the enemy in the battle of Badr] with one twice as great, you said, ‘From where is this?’ Say, ‘It is from yourselves.’ Indeed, Allah is over all things competent} [Āl ‘Imrān: 165]. [During the course of the battle,] the Shaytān shouted to the people, ‘Muhammad has been killed.’ So among them were those who were shaken and fled, and among them were those who stood firm and fought. So Allah said, {Muhammad is not but a messenger. [Other] messengers have passed on before him. So if he were to die or be killed, would you turn back on your heels [to unbelief]? And he who turns back on his heels will never harm Allah at all; but Allah  will  reward  the  grateful}  [Āl  ‘Imrān:  144].  And this was similar to the condition of the Muslims when they broke down last year.”\nHe then mentioned that the defeat of the Muslims in his times was due to sins, bad intentions, boasting, conceitedness, etc., and then said, “So it was out of Allah’s wisdom and His mercy upon the believers that He afflicted them with the trials He had afflicted them with, so that Allah may purify the believers and they may return to their Lord in repentance … Just as Allah’s support for the Muslims on the day of Badr was a mercy and a blessing and their defeat on the day  of  Uhud  was  a  blessing  and  a  mercy  upon  the believers, for indeed the Prophet g said, ‘Allah does not decree anything for the believer except that it is good. And this is not for anyone except the believer. If he receives good and is thankful to Allah, it is good for him, and if he is afflicted with hardship and is patient, it is good for him.’”\nShaykhul-Islām’s words above are just as applicable to the Ummah today. And out of Allah’s great mercy towards the Muslims, He has afflicted them with one \n45\fexpenses in an equally cunning manner. Thus, with the mercy of Allah, Abū Jandal was able to proceed on his hijrah to Shām. He walked towards Allah, and Allah came running to him, as He had promised the believers.\nWhen the news leaked that Abū Jandal had left the country for the Middle East and had not attended the conference, his murtadd maternal uncle, who is connected  with  Bengali  military  intelligence  agency DGFI  (Directorate  General  of  Forces  Intelligence), tried his best to prevent him from entering Shām. Despite the efforts of his uncle and the DGFI, however, Abū  Jandal,  by  Allah’s  grace,  succeeded  in  entering Shām with great ease, underscoring what the Prophet g had said to the young companion ‘Abdullāh Ibn ‘Abbās  j, “Know that if the whole world were to gather  together  in  order  to  benefit  you  something, they would not be able to benefit you with anything other than that which Allah had written for you. And if they were to gather together in order to harm you with something, they would not be able to harm you except with that which Allah had written against you” [Reported  by  at-Tirmidhī].\nUpon entering the blessed land of Shām, his heart was full of joy, and he became the youngest brother among the Bengali muhājirīn. As soon as he joined the  training  camp,  he  informed  the  trainer  that  he wanted to carry out an istishhādī operation and added his name to the list. He was always cheerful and smiling. While awaiting his turn to carry out an istishhādī operation, he joined a battalion and was stationed in ribāt in ‘Ayn al-Islām. Despite his ribāt and fighting, his heart was always concerned for the brothers in his former homeland and the progress of jihād there. He dreamed of Bengal becoming a frontline for the Islamic State and a graveyard for the murtaddīn. When he would come back to the city from ribāt, he would rush to the brothers and inquire about the progress in Bengal. \nHe also used to give sincere nasīhah to the brothers here, and despite growing up in a wealthy family, he always tried to distance himself from city life, preferring instead the toils of jihād. Before leaving to partake in one of the battles in ‘Ayn ‘Īsā, he informed a brother that he did not want to stay in the city and was trying to move to the mountains of Wilāyat Dimashq. At the time, Ramadān was approaching, and his heart was attached to shahādah. He told the brothers with him of his desire for shahādah and prayed that Allah would accept him in the month of Ramadān. He then left for the battle in ‘Ayn ‘Īsā as an inghimāsī. During the course of the operation, he was shot by a 23mm autocannon. The medical team evacuated him from the battlefield and attempted to give him first aid, but he died due to excessive bleeding. The doctor on duty \ninformed the brothers with him that before his last breath he pronounced the shahādah. \nPrior to heading out for the inghimāsī operation, Abū Jandal wrote the following letter to his brothers in Islam:\n“In  the  name  of  Allah,  the  Most  Gracious,  the Most Merciful. All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the Universe, the only one worthy of worship, the only one whose laws will prevail all over the world, the only one in whom the believers should put their trust and hope. To proceed.”\n“This  is  a  sincere  message  from  your  beloved brother living in the blessed lands of the Islamic State. Verily it is Allah’s laws and the sacrifice of the brothers that makes a land blessed. Yā ikhwānī fillāh, four or five months ago I was in the same position as you. I didn’t have any plan as to how to avoid the fitnah surrounding me. I didn’t know how I would ever be able to do jihād fī sabīlillāh. I thought that all my family and friends would boycott me. I was drowning in the same obstacles that you might be going through now. But it is only the promise of Allah, the promise of that Garden in which rivers flow, that kept me going. And it was enough, inshā’allāh.”\n“The following are some points of nasīhah, which I am trying hard to follow and would hope that you, my beloved brothers, would also try to follow. Please note that it is just my duty to give sincere advice to you. Otherwise, I am too small and too sinful to give you advice.”•  “Qiyām al-layl. Yā akhī, it had been the solution for the Sahābah, has been the solution for the brothers, and it will be the same for you, inshā’allāh. Try getting up 15 minutes before Fajr and praying two raka’ah of qiyām al-layl. When you get used to it, then increase by 15 minutes. Is this so hard?”\n•  “Try to make the Qur’ān your best companion. Read it, listen to it, memorize it, spend much time with it, apply it. It is better than gossiping with the  brothers.”\n•  “Try to do regular physical exercise at home. Don’t \nskip this point.”\nIndeed,  Abū  Jandal  was  among  those  brothers who were not satisfied with merely reaching the lands of the Khilāfah and partaking in jihād for the cause of Allah. One can see from his letter that despite being involved in jihād, one of the greatest acts of sacrifice and worship, he continually sought to improve himself and strengthen his relationship with his Lord. May Allah accept him among the shuhadā’ and inspire many more through his words and deeds.\n51\f"

It has reached me that some of you turned back from their religion after accepting  Islam  and  acting  in  accordance  with  it, out of delusion about Allah, ignorance of His affair, and in response to Shaytān. Allah (ta’ālā) said, {And [mention] when We said to the angels, “Prostrate to Ādam,” and they prostrated, except for Iblīs. He was of the jinn and departed from the command of his Lord. Then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than Me while they are enemies to you? Wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange} [Al-Kahf:  50].

Whoever  answers  him, accepts the truth, halts his evil, and does good, my envoy will accept this from him and will aid him in it. If he refuses, I’ve ordered him to wage war against them over their refusal, to not spare anyone he is able to kill, to burn them alive with fire, to kill them in a severe manner using all means, to enslave their women  and  children,  and  to  not  accept  from  any one of them anything but Islam. Whoever follows it, then it is best for him. And whoever leaves it, then he cannot incapacitate Allah. I’ve ordered my envoy to read this message in every gathering of yours and the signal is the adhān. [I’ve said to my army] if the Muslims perform adhān and they [the apostates] do not perform adhān, then rush to kill them. And if they [the apostates] perform adhān, then restrain yourselves from attacking them until you ask them to deliver what is obligatory upon them [the zakāh]. If they refuse, then rush to kill them. If they agree, it  will  be  accepted  from  them,  and  my  envoy  will make them carry out their duties.\nA FEEBLE PLEA FROM THE KHALAF TO THE TAWĀGHĪT!\n(From adh-Dhawāhirī to the Tāghūt Morsi)\nAs  for  my  message  to  Doctor  Muhammad  Morsi, then I say to him: first of all, I ask Allah to relieve you of your suffering, guide your heart, and rectify for  you  your  religion  and  worldly  affair.  I  also  ask Allah  to  keep  your  heart  firm,  fill  your  heart  with certainty, faith, and firmness, so that you support His  religion  and  law  without  fear  or  compromise, and  that  He  bestows  you  with  adherence  to  the statement  of  al-Mustafā  (sallallāhu ‘alayhi  wa sallam), “The best jihād is a word of truth in front of an unjust ruler” and his statement (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam), “The leader of martyrs is Hamzah Ibn ‘Abdil-Muttalib and a man who confronts an unjust ruler, orders him with good, and prohibits him from evil,  and  so  the  ruler  kills  him.”  And  I  advise  you while sincerely directing this advice towards you and hoping for your guidance, success, and firmness. So I say, you dealt with the secularists and assented to them,  with  the  crusaders  and  conceded  to  them, with the Americans and gave them guarantees, with the Israelis and recognized the submissive treaties with them, with Mubārak’s army who were raised upon American aid and you assented to them, and \nIF I WERE IN THE PLACE OF MORSI AND SAT ON THE KURSĪ [THRONE]\n BY HUSĀM ‘ABDUR-RA’ŪF\n[Tārīkh at-Tabarī; Al-Bidāyah wan-Nihāyah]\nA DEVIANT BOOK WRITTEN BY A TOP LEADER OF AL-QĀ´IDAH!\n18 HISTORY\n\f[At-Tawbah: 5], a sword for Ahlul-Kitāb, {Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day  and  who  do  not  consider  unlawful  what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and  who  do  not  adopt  the  religion  of  truth from those who were given the Book – [fight them] until they give the jizyah willingly while they  are  humbled}  [At-Tawbah:  29],  a  sword for  the  munāfiqīn,  {O  Prophet,  fight  against the  kuffār  and  the  munāfiqīn}  [At-Tawbah: 73],  and  a  sword  for  the  bughāt  (rebellious aggressors), {Then fight against the group that commits baghy (aggression) until it returns to the ordinance of Allah} [Al-Hujurāt: 9]” [Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr].\nHe  also  revealed  the  sword  against  the apostates, {O you who have believed, whoever of you should revert from his religion – Allah will bring forth a people He will love and who will  love  Him  [who  are]  humble  toward  the believers, mighty against the disbelievers; they strive in the cause of Allah and do not fear the blame of a critic} [Al-Mā’idah: 54].

Then an army from Madīnah of the best people on the earth at that time will leave for them. When they line up in ranks the Romans will  say,  ‘Leave  us  and  those  who  were  enslaved from amongst us so we can fight them.’ The Muslims will say, ‘Nay, by Allah, we will not  abandon  our  brothers  to  you.’  So  they will  fight  them.  Then  one  third  of  them  will flee; Allah will never forgive them. One third of  them  will  be  killed;  they  will  be  the  best martyrs with Allah. And one third will conquer them; they will never be afflicted with fitnah. Then they will conquer Constantinople. While they are dividing the war booty, having hung their swords on olive trees, Shaytān will shout, ‘The [false] Messiah has followed after your families [who were left behind.]’ So they will leave [for their families], but Shaytān’s claim is false. When they arrive to Shām he comes out. Then when they are preparing for battle and filing their ranks, the prayer is called. So ‘Īsā Ibn Maryam (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) will descend and lead them. When the enemy of Allah sees him, he will melt as salt melts in  water.  If  he  were  to  leave  him  he  would melt until he perished, but he kills him with his own hand, and then shows them his blood upon his spear” [Sahīh Muslim].\nAllah’s  Messenger  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam) said, “You will have a treaty of security with the Romans until you both fight an enemy beyond them. And you will be victorious, you will gain war booty, and you will achieve such  without  losses.  Thereafter  you  will  return  until  you  lodge  at  a  pastureland  full  of rocky mounds. A man from the Roman Christians will then raise the cross. He will say, ‘The cross has prevailed!’ A man from the Muslims \nwill  then  say,  ‘Rather  Allah  has  prevailed,’  and then he will angrily rise and crush the cross, which is not at a distance from him. Then the Romans will betray the treaty by rising against the breaker of the cross and striking his neck. The Muslims will  then  rise  and  rush  to  their  arms.  They  will then battle. Allah will bless this party of Muslims with shahādah. The Romans will say to the Roman leader, ‘We are sufficient for you against the Arabs.’ They will then gather for the Malhamah (the grand battle before the Hour). They will come for you under eighty banners, with each banner there will be twelve thousand people” [Sahīh – reported by Imām Ahmad, Abū Dāwūd, Ibn Mājah, Ibn Hibbān, and al-Hākim on the authority of Dhī Mikhmar].\ndabiq\f"

May  blessings  and  peace  be  upon the  cheerful  warrior  and  upon  his  companions and family. As to what follows: O Allah, there is nothing easy except what You made easy and You make  sadness  easy  if  You  will.  O  Allah  bestow us with shahādah for Your cause purely for Your noble face.\nIn reality, the total siege of South Dimashq began four years ago. An exception to that siege was the Yarmūk  Camp.  The  regime  conspired  with  Free Syrian  Army  leaders  in  the  region  to  keep  the camp open in order to empty the huge storehouses found in the district of ‘Aqrabā and Bayt Sahm. These areas were stores for the regime in which it would store staple food supplies like sugar, rice, bulgur, and so on, and it would use the Yarmūk Camp  as  a  passage  to  move  these  food  supplies out of the storehouses.\nThe  regime  worked  according  to  this  evil  plan for about a year, until it was sure the storehouses \nand huge factories were completely emptied and nothing  remained  in  the  area  except  for  scarce quantities sufficing the Muslims for a month or two. The work was completed under the gaze of Aknāf  Bayt  al-Maqdis  and  they  were  the  ones supervising the only passage into the camp. The passage was closed on 15 Ramadān 1433, and it was at that time that hunger started assaulting the Muslims’ bodies and death started reaping their souls until more than 170 people died due to lack of supplies and hunger.\nDābiq: What is the relationship between Aknāf Bayt  al-Maqdis  and  Hamas?  Did  Hamas  take part  militarily,  operationally,  politically,  or through  propaganda,  in  the  war  against  the Islamic State?\nYarmūk: Aknāf Bayt al-Maqdis is Hamas’ branch in  South  Dimashq.  This  faction  was  established during the beginning of the events in Shām for a fundamental aim, which was the creation of an internal  force  considered  “revolutionaries”  who at the same time act as guards defending regimecontrolled  Dimashq;  and  Aknāf  succeeded  in this  task.  As  for  what  concerns  the  relationship between Hamas and Aknāf, the names of the three \ndabiq\n\fclaimed  just  last  year  was  being  successfully pushed  back  by  American  intervention  policy. Indeed, he claimed that the same model (cutting finances, recruitment tools, and the will to fight) that worked so “well” in the degradation of the mujāhidīn there before their pledge of allegiance, would work just as well on the Islamic State.\nSome things just don’t work out as planned.\nThe energy behind this movement is fearsome. A single lion can kill an antelope but a pride that is hungry and cunning enough can, if they work closely together, take down an African elephant. As groups of mujāhidīn from around the world join  forces,  so  the  strength  behind  the  Islamic State  puts  them  in  a  position  to  devour  much larger prey.\nThe  West  and  its  allies  have,  once  again,  been caught  completely  by  surprise  as  they  now  find themselves  fighting  not  just  one  enemy  in  Iraq and  Shām,  but  now  an  international  army  of mujāhidīn  numbering  hundreds  of  thousands in  different  countries,  whole  continents  apart. It’s taken the coalition the best part of a year to put together a campaign against the Islamic State that is only now seeing a Shia mob supported by coalition aircraft make moves against Tikrit, but that’s old news before it’s even begun. Why focus on Tikrit when the Middle East, Africa, and Asia are now on fire?\nAnd  this  movement  shows  no  sign  of  abating. Indeed, this quickening, this coming together of Islamic groups sharing the same focus and purity of belief is only intensifying. And the more groups that join, the stronger the movement becomes.\nAs  the  groups  evolve  from  splintered  cells  each waging their own wars to a single, unified body, it becomes a force of immense power, like a snowball that  rolls  down  a  mountain  getting  larger  until you end up with an avalanche. The more outfits work together, so they can use each other’s skills and strengths to fill in the gaps until there are very few weak points.\nRAND crusader Jonah Blank\n“Say one group is very good at bomb making and the other group is very good at propaganda,” says Jonah  Blank  from  the  US  “think-tank”  RAND Corporation.  “If  you  put  the  right  bomb  in  the right  place  for  the  right  propaganda  effect,  that can  be  far  more  important  than  either  of  these things on their own.”\n“This isn’t just propaganda,” said Gary Bernsten, a former CIA intelligence officer on an interview with Fox News on 9th March. “ISIS has billions of dollars. They have a network of communications for reaching out to these groups. And it shows you how deadly and effective ISIS is. They are truly the most  successful  Sunni  terrorist  group  in  history because  they’ve  carved  out  a  space  for  a  nation state,  and  these  other  groups  recognize  that.  It shows Obama’s statement that ‘this isn’t Islam’ is a false narrative. ISIS has been brilliant at selling itself  to  the  hundreds  of  millions  of  people  out there looking for a message.”\nAnd what of Obama of late? In all honesty, I haven’t seen what the Nobel Peace prizewinner has been commenting  on  recently,  but  he  can’t  be  having much fun. “This strategy of taking out terrorists \ndabiq\n\f"

        "@value": "dabiq\n\fIndeed, when Allah obligated jihād for His cause upon his male slaves and placed a tremendous reward in it not found in other duties, some women became jealous and envious. So the Mother of the Believers, Umm Salamah   asked  the  Prophet  ,  according  to  the  hadīth  of Mujāhid, “O Messenger of Allah, the men go out to battle and we do not go out to battle…” So Allah  revealed: {And do not wish for that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others} [An-Nisā’: 32], as reported by atTirmidhī and others.\nStill, the absence of an obligation of jihād and war upon the Muslim woman – except in defense against someone attacking her – does not overturn her role in building the Ummah, producing men, and sending them out to the fierceness of battle.\nTherefore, I write this article for my Muslim sister, the wife of a mujāhid and the mother of lion cubs.\nAllah   said, {But among them is he who says, “Our Lord, give us good in this dunyā and good in the Hereafter and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.” Those will have a share of what they have earned, and Allah is swift in account} [Al-Baqarah: 201-202].\nAccording to ‘Alī Ibn Abī Tālib , {good in this dunyā} refers to “the righteous wife” [Zād al-Masīr].\nThawbān  said,  “When  the  revelation  concerning  silver and gold came down, they said, ‘So what wealth should we seek to possess?’ ‘Umar said, ‘I will find out for you.’ He then rode quickly on a camel and reached him while I was on his heels. So he said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what wealth should we seek to possess?’ He said, ‘Let one of you possess a thankful heart, a tongue that remembers Allah,  and  a  wife  that  helps  him  in  the  matter  of  the Hereafter’” [Hasan: Reported by Imām Ahmad and Ibn Mājah].\nMay  my  father,  mother,  and  myself  be  sacrificed  in defense  of  Allah’s  Messenger,  who  was  bestowed  with comprehensive  speech:  “A  wife  that  helps  him  in  the matter  of  the  Hereafter,”  the  Hereafter,  the  important matter,  the  ultimate  goal,  and  the  concern  of  the intelligent,  discerning  believer.  How  eloquent  is  the statement of the woman who said to her spouse when she saw him worried one day, “Why are you sad? Is it because of the Dunyā, then Allah has finished decreeing it. Or is it because of the Hereafter? In which case may Allah increase you in worry!”\nAnd you, O sister in Islam, O wife of a mujāhid, your \nhusband  is  one  whom  the  world  today  agreed  upon waging  war  against.  My  sister,  do  you  know  who  the mujāhid is? A man who turned his back on the Dunyā and  went  out  seeking  his  death  so  that  the  Ummah may live. And I think that on the day he came forward to marry you, if he was not a mujāhid then, he was a mujāhid in the making. At the very least, you were aware of his methodology and creed, and you knew what type of life he sought to live. And if he was a deviant sitting back from jihād at the time, he has repented to Allah, and Allah is more joyed by the repentance of His slave than  a  man  who  wakes  up  and  finds  his  camel  next to him after losing it in the desert! So why do we find some of the mujāhidīn’s wives complaining about their lives? If she hears of an imminent battle that he will be in, she gets angry. If she sees him putting on war armor, she gets upset. If he goes out for ribāt, she gets in a bad mood.  If  he  returns  late,  she  complains.  O  my  sister, who deluded you and told you that the life of jihād is one of comfort and ease? Do you not love jihād and its people? Please listen. Indeed you are in jihād when you await the return of your husband patiently, anticipating Allah’s reward, and making du’ā’ for him and those with him to attain victory and consolidation. You are in jihād when you uphold your loyalty to him in his absence. You are in jihād when you teach his children the difference between  the  truth  and  falsehood,  between  right  and wrong. Indeed, you, my precious sister, are today the wife of a mujāhid, and tomorrow you might be the wife of a shahīd, or an injured fighter, or a prisoner – so how ready is your supply of patience and steadfastness? If you are discontent and complain in times of ease and comfort, how will you be in times of hardship and affliction?! Will you be patient if he returns to you being carried with his blood pouring, or do you want your husband only when he is well?\nIbn Kathīr  said, “The scholars of tafsīr and history, as well as others, said that Ayyūb  was a wealthy man who possessed many different types of wealth, including livestock,  slaves,  cattle,  and  ample  land  in  the  region of al-Buthaynah in the land of Hūrān. And Ibn ‘Asākir narrated that all of it belonged to him and that he had sons and many relatives. Then he was bereaved of these things altogether and his body was afflicted with various illnesses and no healthy organ remained in him except for his heart and his tongue, with which he remembered Allah  b,  and  throughout  all  that  he  was  patient, anticipating reward from Allah and remembering Allah b day and night. His illness was so long, that even his friends and companions deserted him. He was expelled from his land and cast onto a garbage heap outside of it. The people cut ties with him and none remained having \ndabiq\n\f"

However, this in itself is not enough to save me. Although I’ve been informed that the aerial campaign in Iraq has been halted, which at the moment has given me breathing room thanks be to God, I believe it looks like it’s not enough Mom because Obama’s recent decision to fly spy drones over Syria in the Islamic State’s airspace is only aggravating and infuriating my captors further. This is obviously because the US government is interfering yet again in the affairs of the Islamic State. As for me being a journalist, they know this. I’ve repeatedly told them this, but like they always say, do US airstrikes differentiate between those who are armed and those who are unarmed? Likewise they don’t. Beseeching the Caliphate to spare my life will not help either of us, as the matter is in Obama’s  next  judgment.  As  you  and  the  world have plainly seen in the recent video, the message was my life depends on Obama’s next decision.\nMom, please don’t let Obama kill me. Do not let him  get  away  with  murder  again.  What  doesn’t our government understand? Don’t get involved in the Islamic State’s internal and external affairs. Leave them to fight their own war.\nMom, you can still save my life, just like the families of my previous cellmates who I’m sure you’ve met.  Pressure  our  government  to  not  involve themselves in the affairs of these people.\nAt the rate that Obama’s administration is going, this could very well be the last you hear from me. Please don’t let that be the case. Fight for me.I love you.\n[End of Message]\n\fbeen  executed  by  the  Islamic  State  in  the  most visceral way possible after the British and American  governments  apparently  made  a  joint  decision not to discuss terms for our release with our captors. And now, unless something changes very quickly and very radically, I await my turn.\nSuch an environment forces the mind to change. I’ve  had  to  become  pretty  tough  inside,  sometimes  just  to  get  through  each  day.  The  Sheikh who originally captured James Foley and me back in November 2012 said, “to go through this you will need a heart of stone.” And he was right. I try to  stay  very  calm,  tolerant  and  accepting  of  my situation. Muslims call it ‘Qadr Allah,’ the will of God, who determines everything in advance. I am thankful for any comfort I receive and for every plate of food I get.\nIt hasn’t been an easy road, and some of us had a bumpy ride. Once we were finally put into general population with dozens of European prisoners, we had to watch them all go home to their loved ones while we, the British and Americans, were left behind. That was a bitter pill to swallow, but  nothing  compared to what came next. Now I’ve had to watch as James, Steven Sotloff, David Haines and Alan Henning walked out of the door, one every two weeks since August 18th, never to return, knowing they were going to be killed and going to their deaths. \nAnd  now  they’re  gone,  their  faces  and  deaths plastered all over the world’s headlines, four foolish policy victims.\nWhat does that do to a man? After enduring years of pain, darkness and regret, to see it all end in such a  ghastly  way  when  everyone  else  went  home, to  see  ordinary  guys,  family  men,  loving  fathers killed  because  their  governments  wouldn’t  negotiate because of ‘policy,’ wouldn’t even discuss options for saving them with their families – can you begin to imagine how that feels? This wasn’t a fateful soul taken at random, it was individuals missing for years in one of the most high-profile hostage crisis seen in modern history, with dozens \nof  witnesses  who  had  gone  home  testifying they were alive and could be helped. I believe even the mujahidin were genuinely surprised at how easily our countries left us for dead. \nWe’d  come  all  this  way,  putting  one  foot  in front  of  the  other,  supporting  one  another when  it  got  tough,  praying  together  every day. We used to call it the Dead Zone when things got bad, after the area Everest climbers face above 26,000 feet as they approach the summit, when every step is agony, when they hardly have enough strength to carry on. We never  gave  up  hope  that  our  nations  would negotiate for our release.\nBut all that time, we never knew that the decision regarding our fate had been made months beforehand in Washington and Whitehall. We never knew that our families, for whom it was like being locked up in prison with us, were being blanked by the governments or being told there  was  nothing  they  could  do.  We  never knew that the families were left to themselves to try anything and everything, while the men in charge folded their arms and offered their sympathies.\ndabiq\f"

        "@value": "Interview with Abū Samīr al-Urdunī\nDābiq: What information do you have about the Sahwah plot and the role of the Jawlānī front in it?\nAbū Samīr: Jawlānī visited me in the last days of December  2013  and  informed  me  that  he  had been  in  a  meeting  with  the  “Islamic  Front”  and its  battalions  including  “Liwā’  at-Tawhīd”  and also  some  of  the  battalions  that  belong  to  the Free Syrian Army. He informed me that they had decided  to  fight  the  Islamic  State.  I  said  to  him, “Why were you invited to this meeting?” He said, “For the issue to be proposed and discussed with me, because I am one of the sides in the arena and close to the Islamic State.” I said to him, “What was your response?” He said, “I told them I would cover the fronts against the regime.” I said, “Then that is your role!” He said to me, “How can you say I have a role to play?” So I said to him, “You are going to cover  some  of  the  battlefronts  that  these  factions now hold in order for them to withdraw and then gather in larger numbers against the Islamic State.” This  is  really  what  happened  afterwards  and  that was approximately 10 days after this meeting with Jawlānī on 3 January 2014.1\nIn  fact,  I  even  heard  Ahmad  Zakkūr,  one  of  the leaders  of  “Jabhat  an-Nusrah,”  calling  Jawlānī  on the  walkie-talkie  when  he  had  disappeared  from sight  after  the  fighting  between  the  Islamic  State and  the  factions  including  the  Free  Syrian  Army had begun. Zakkūr said to him, “We have to help our brothers from the factions present in the arena and  stop  the  oppression  of  the  Islamic  State  and fight against it.”\nThis is in addition to other events I myself witnessed. When  for  example,  some  of  the  leadership  of “Jabhat  an-Nusrah”  supported  the  Free  Syrian Army with weapons and helped them in fighting against  the  Islamic  State  in  some  regions,  as  was the case of Hammawdah and Abū Dharr at-Tūnusī in the western part of Halab. [Hammawdah is the Jawlānī front’s top leader of that region].\n1 Editor’s Note: Jawlānī had foreknowledge of the plot and kept it hidden from the Islamic State. Rather he took part in the planning and execution of the plot, a plot which almost destroyed the mission of jihād in Shām and by which the pure blood of the muhājirīn and ansār was poured. Then some dare to claim that his front did not partake in the Sahwah!\nThe  same  thing  in  Idlib,  in  that  Abū  Sulaymān the  Australian  prevented  the  soldiers  of  “Jabhat an-Nusrah”  from  helping  the  Islamic  State  when the Free Syrian Army planned to attack the State’s training  camp  there  while  it  was  possible  for them to help the Islamic State. So I sent for Abū Sulaymān the Australian and said to him, “You are able to place detachments to prevent the Free Syrian Army’s advance towards the training camp.” I was surprised the next day that the Free Syrian Army had entered the training camp after surrounding it and cutting off reinforcement lines, and had fought the  soldiers  of  the  Islamic  State  inside.  This  was the  beginning  of  my  suspicion  that  there  was  an internal  plot  between  the  Free  Syrian  Army  and “Jabhat an-Nusrah.”\nDābiq: When did you decide to distance yourself from the events that were occurring?\nAbū Samīr: After my examination and following of the events, I felt that there was a plot being carried out against the Islamic State with the participation of “Jabhat an-Nusrah.” So I decided to keep myself distant  and  move  to  the  south.  On  my  way,  I gathered much evidence for this conclusion. From it is that I met Abū ‘Abbās ad-Darīr, who was the leader of “Jabhat an-Nusrah” for the region of arRaqqah. I met him in the area of Albūkamāl and asked  him  about  the  reason  for  his  fighting  the Islamic State in ar-Raqqah. He mentioned to me the whole story of how he and Ahrār ash-Shām had agreed with many of the battalions including those of Abū ‘Īsā ar-Raqqah (Liwā’ Thuwwār ar-Raqqah) \nAbū Sulaymān the Australian,an ally of the FSA\ndabiq\n\f"

Despite  the  obvious  incompetence  of  the  PKK in facing the Islamic State, the crusader coalition continued  to  provide  them  with  close  air  cover in their clashes against the mujāhidīn. The PKK would claim that they were advancing against the Islamic State, when the reality was that they and their FSA allies would simply move into any given area after the crusaders had already bombed the Islamic State positions there, leaving the area up for grabs. The PKK and their allies weren’t fighting for territory, they were simply hiding and waiting it out, letting the crusaders do the work and then walking in and reaping the “fruits” when it was all over. These cowardly tactics are the reason that they and their FSA allies – Jamāl Ma’rūf4, Abū ‘Īsā ar-Raqqah5,  and  ‘Abdul-Jabbār  al-‘Akīdī6  –  were recently  able  to  advance  on  the  towns  of  Sulūk and Tall Abyad in Wilāyat ar-Raqqah.7 4 An FSA leader and former ally of the Jawlānī front.5 The former leader of the Jawlānī front in ar-Raqqah up until three months into the Sahwah. He was disowned by the Jawlānī front because they were supposedly no longer able to make contact with him – not because of his kufr – and yet everyday they claim to make contact with Dhawāhirī’s al-Qā’idah all the way in Khurāsān!6 A former leader in the so-called “Liwā’ at-Tawhid.”7 PKK advances have been coupled with ethnic cleansing carried out against Arabs and Turkmen for the sake of establishing a purely Kurdish “American Kurdistan.” The secularist Kurds’ hatred of Arabs in particular leads them to hate Islam by extension and even sympathize with the Jews and their Jewish state! Despite this fact, the statement released by the Sahwāt condemning the PKK does not make takfir of them, nor does it denounce \nCrusader airstrikes on ‘Ayn al-Islam turned the city into rubble\nYet  being  the  incompetent  proxies  that  they are,  the  PKK  –  shortly  afterwards  –  found themselves flanked by Islamic State soldiers who infiltrated  their  territory  and  entered  ‘Ayn  alIslām once more, with further gains being made by the mujāhidīn thereafter in the southern and western  countryside.  This  is  in  addition  to  the Khilāfah’s offensive in Wilāyat al-Barakah where the mujāhidīn advanced on the city of al-Barakah \ntheir hatred of Islam and the Sharī’ah. Rather, it focuses exclusively on a nationalist issue, denouncing their oppression of Syrian Arabs and Turkmen, and declaring that they do not approve of dividing “the Syrian nation.”\ndabiq\n\fHim,  we  seek  His  help  and  forgiveness,  and we  seek  refuge  with  Allah  from  the  evils  of  our inner  selves  and  from  the  consequences  of  our bad  deeds.

I testify that there is no god except Allah alone, who has no partner, and  I  testify  that  Muhammad  is  His  slave  and messenger.\nWe call the Muslims and the mujāhidīn everywhere to  give  bay’ah  to  the  Khalīfah  in  obedience  to Allah’s  command,  for  the  truth  has  become  as clear as the sun in the middle of the day, and only the blind one is incapable of seeing it.\nAllah    said,  {And  say,  “Truth  has  come,  and falsehood has departed. Indeed is falsehood, ever bound to depart”} [Al-Isrā’: 81].\nAs for what follows: \nAllah    said,  {And  hold  firmly  to  the  rope  of Allah all together and do not become divided} [Āl ‘Imrān: 103].\nAllah’s  Messenger    said,  “Whoever  dies  while not  having  bay’ah,  dies  a  death  of  jāhiliyyah” [Sahīh Muslim].\nTherefore,  in  obedience  to  the  command  of Allah , and in obedience to His Messenger , ordering to stick to the jamā’ah and not to divide, we  declare  our  bay’ah  to  the  Khalīfah  Ibrāhīm Ibn ‘Awwād Ibn Ibrāhīm al-Qurashī al-Husaynī, pledging to selflessly hear and obey, in times of hardship  and  ease,  and  in  times  of  delight  and dislike. We  pledge  not  to  dispute  the  matter  of those in authority except if we see obvious kufr concerning which we have proof from Allah.\nWe,  the  mujāhidīn  of  al-Qawqāz  in  the  regions of Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia, and Kabika testify  that  we  are  all  in  agreement  on  this position, and that there are no differences between us concerning this matter.\nThe  Khalīfah  of  the  Muslims  has  extended  his hand to you for your support, so that he may carry out  the  command  of  Allah  and  establish  Allah’s Sharī’ah everywhere. So respond to your Khalīfah, and extend your hands and give bay’ah.\nAllah    said,  {Allah  has  promised  those  who have  believed  among  you  and  done  righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession to authority upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them and that He will surely establish for them their religion which He has preferred for them and that He will surely substitute for them, after  their  fear,  security,  for  they  worship  Me, not  associating  anything  with  Me.  But  whoever disbelieves after that – then those are the defiantly disobedient} [An-Nūr: 55].\nSo obey the command of Allah to unite and not to  divide,  and  do  not  listen  to  the  evil  scholars nor  obey  those  leaders  who  call  you  to  remain disunited, divided with your various groups, and scattered.

That left a number of British and American prisoners remaining in the cells of the Islamic State, only after  their  governments  arrogantly  refused  to release our imprisoned brothers and our sister, Dr. Aafia Siddiqui. \nTo paraphrase James, the Obama administration ultimately hit the last nail in James’s coffin and killed him by bombing Iraq. A message was sent two days before James’s execution, warning of his demise as a result of the US airstrikes in Iraq. The solution was easy… Stop the airstrikes!\nThe arrogant US government paid no attention to  the  offer  nor  to  the  threats  that  accompanied it, so the question that every rational person needs to ask is what is the real reason behind  the  Obama  administration’s  refusal to comply with the demands put forward by \nThe answer is that Obama now blindly follows the example of “the war president” Bush. He will continue  to  strengthen  the  ancient  and  historical enemy of the West – Persia/Iran. He sends comforting signals to the agents of the Iranian government in Syria and Lebanon (al-Asad and Hezbollah).  Through  his  decisions,  he  solidifies the  Iranian  puppet  government  in  Iraq  as  well as the Iranian-backed Shiite militias allied to the puppet government. \nHe supports the Shiite allies of Iran in Afghanistan. He strikes the mujāhidīn – the true enemies of the Shia in Yemen – and thus emboldens the Houthi agents of Iran. He does all this more  foolishly  than  Bush,  for  Iran  is  a  key  ally of Russia, another historical enemy of the West, currently battling Western allies in the Ukraine and elsewhere! And to achieve these goals, he sacrifices the welfare of the American public for the  sake  of  “the  chosen  few”  benefitting  from Zionism  and  capitalism,  as  America  faces  crisis after  crisis  including  earthquakes  in  California, protests in Missouri, and the potential deaths of American prisoners held by the Islamic State…\ndabiq\fAs I speak here before you, I call on you to wake up and take your lives and the lives of your children  into  your  own  hands.

Think John. Who is it they really killed? And did they think about me, or you, or our family and how that decision is going to affect us?\nI died on that day John. When your colleagues dropped  those  bombs,  they  signed  my  death certificate!\nI wish I had more time. I wish I could have the hope  of  freedom  and  seeing  my  family  once again.

That one nation is the group following the Quran and the Sunnah, with allegiance to one leader, the Caliph of the Muslims. Referring to when there shall appear “callers to the gates of Hell,” who are “of our skin and our language” and whose followers will be thrown into the Fire, our Prophet g commanded that we “adhere to the group of the Muslims and their leader” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim); yes, the single group of the Muslims and their single leader, around whom they unite and fulfill Allah’s command, “O you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those of authority amongst you” (An-Nisa 59).\nDo you not see the many so-called “imams” and “scholars” calling to alliances against Islam with the disbelievers, to maintaining the Muslim nation’s separation by imaginary borders, and to rejecting the reestablishment  of  the  Caliphate,  which  many  of  the earlier scholars called “the most important of obligations?!” Are these imams not “of our skin and our language,” yet call to what would inevitably lead to our doom? Indeed, they are callers to the gates of Hell, so beware and do not be fooled by them.\nSo reject these calls to disunity and come together. Live the life of Islam, for which you have already left the path of falsehood, and do not die the death of  Jahiliyyah,  a  time  in  which  there  was  no  united Muslim nation having pledged allegiance to a single imam and thus having no obedience to a rightful authority. Indeed, the Prophet g said, “Whoever dies unbound by a bay’ah (pledge of allegiance) has died a jahili death” (Muslim). And he said, “Whoever dislikes something in his leader, let him be patient. For whoever leaves the obedience of lawful authority, even \nBeware of dying as an apostate\na hand span (and dies), has died the death of Jahiliyyah” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nAt the onset of Ramadan in 1435, the mujahidin, who were engaging fierce battles against the Crusaders, their allies, and their puppets in Iraq and the Levant, reached a level where all conditions required to announce the Caliphate were met. So with great joy, the lost obligation was revived and the Muslim world could once again be united, by Allah’s grace, around a single imam, Ibrahim Ibn ‘Awwad al-Badri .\nRegardless of where you are, know that pledging allegiance is an obligation upon you, as is listening to your leader, the Caliph, and obeying his command. Allah’s Messenger g said, “The Muslim must listen and obey in what he loves and what he hates, as long as he is not commanded with a sin. If he is commanded with a sin, there is neither listening nor obeying (in that sin)” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nRush to perform hijrah (emigration) to the land of Islam, where the Shari’ah is in full application. Hijrah is a sign of both one’s love for unity and his adherence to the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger g. This was reiterated as a direct order from Amirul-Muminin, who said, “O Muslims everywhere, whoever is capable of performing hijrah to the Islamic State, then let him do so, because hijrah to the land of Islam is obligatory” (A Message to the Mujahidin and the Muslim Ummah).\nBut  if  you  are  unable  to  do  so,  then  know  that \n\fChristian disbelief and paganism\nthat the masses deem to be “politically incorrect.” The apostate “imams” in the West will adhere to the same tired cliché in order to avoid a backlash from the disbelieving societies in which they’ve chosen to reside. The point is, people know that it’s foolish, but they keep repeating it regardless because they’re afraid of the consequences of deviating from the script.\nThere  are  exceptions  among  the  disbelievers,  no doubt, people who will unabashedly declare that jihad and the laws of the Shari’ah – as well as everything else deemed taboo by the Islam-is-a-peaceful-religion crowd – are in fact completely Islamic, but they tend to be people with far less credibility who are painted as a social fringe, so their voices are dismissed and a large segment of the ignorant masses continues believing the false narrative. As such, it becomes important for us to clarify to the West in unequivocal terms – yet again – why we hate you and why we fight you.\n1.  We hate you, first and foremost, because you are  disbelievers;  you  reject  the  oneness  of  Allah  – whether  you  realize  it  or  not  –  by  making  partners for  Him  in  worship,  you  blaspheme  against  Him, claiming that He has a son, you fabricate lies against His prophets and messengers, and you indulge in all manner of devilish practices. It is for this reason that we were commanded to openly declare our hatred for you and our enmity towards you. “There has already been for you an excellent example in Abraham and \nthose with him, when they said to their people, ‘Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than Allah. We have rejected you, and there has arisen, between us and you, enmity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone’” (Al-Mumtahanah 4). Furthermore, just as your disbelief  is  the  primary  reason  we  hate  you,  your  disbelief is the primary reason we fight you, as we have been commanded to fight the disbelievers until they submit to the authority of Islam, either by becoming Muslims, or by paying jizyah – for those afforded this option – and living in humiliation under the rule of the Muslims. Thus, even if you were to stop fighting us, your best-case scenario in a state of war would be that we would suspend our attacks against you – if we deemed it necessary – in order to focus on the closer and more immediate threats, before eventually resuming our campaigns against you. Apart from the option of a temporary truce, this is the only likely scenario that would bring you fleeting respite from our attacks. So in the end, you cannot bring an indefinite halt to our war against you. At most, you could only delay it temporarily. “And fight them until there is no fitnah [paganism] and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah” (Al-Baqarah 193).\n2.  We hate you because your secular, liberal societies permit the very things that Allah has prohibited while banning many of the things He has permitted,  a  matter  that  doesn’t  concern  you  because  you \n\f"

Do you really  think  that  the  Islamic  Khilāfah  or  even  just the Islamic State will ever be established? That is something that can never happen and it is closer to imagination than reality.’ So if they say such to you, then remember the statement of Allah ta’ālā, {[Remember]  when  the  hypocrites  and  those  in whose  hearts  was  disease  said,  ‘Their  religion has deluded those [Muslims].’ But whoever relies upon Allah – then indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and  Wise}  [Al-Anfāl:  49].  And  say  to  them,  ‘Indeed, Allah will grant the Muslims the conquest of Rome, just as Allah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) promised’” [Wasāyā Hāmmah Lil Mujāhidīn].\nHe  also  said,  “We  perform  jihād  here  while  our eyes are upon al-Quds. We fight here, while our goal is Rome with good expectations concerning Allah that He makes us the keys for the Prophetic good tidings and Godly decrees” [Riyāh an-Nasr].\nThis attitude then was inherited by his successor, Abū Hamzah al-Muhājir (rahimahullāh), who said, “O muwahhidīn, receive glad tidings, for by Allah, we will not rest from our jihād  until we are under the olive trees of Rome, after we destroy the filthy house called the White House” [Inil Hukmu Illā Lillāh].\nThis attitude was also echoed by the mountainous man, Abū ‘Umar al-Baghdādī (rahimahullāh), who said, “O soldiers of the Islamic State, O youth of Muhammad (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam)… Today we are upon the doorstep for a new era, a turning point for the map of the region, rather the world. Today we witness the end of the lie called western  civilization  and  the  rise  of  the  Islamic  giant. This is exactly what Bush warned against in his last speech  in  front  of  veterans  when  he  said, ‘The region is changing into one that threatens  civilization  with  destruction,’  meaning the civilization of shirk and kufr, the civilization of usury and prostitution, the civili-\nzation of humiliation and subjugation. And he said regarding the soldiers of the Islamic State in Mesopotamia, ‘They strive to reestablish a khilāfah expanding from Spain to Indonesia.’ This was after he made them the single Sunnī threat towards America and its civilization” [Wa Yamkurūna Wa Yamkurullāh].\nAnd he said, “This prompted the enemy of Allah – Bush – to say after the blessed rise of the Islamic State, ‘They strive to establish an Islamic State stretching from China to Spain.’ He spoke the truth although he is a liar” [Wa Qul Jā’al Haqqu Wa Zahaqal Bātil].\nAnd this certainty in Allah’s promise prompted Abū ‘Umar al-Baghdādī to say with full conviction,  “Inna  Dawlatal-Islāmi  Bāqiyah”  (Indeed, the Islamic State will remain…) [Hasād as-Sinīn].\n\fed by their fear of you? Why is it that the chest muscles of America and its allies shiver out of fear of you? Where are your warplanes? Where are your battleships? Where are your missiles? Where are your weapons of mass destruction? Why is it that the world has united against you? Why  have  the  nations  of  disbelief  entrenched together against you?”\n“So know that – by Allah – we fear not the swarms of planes, nor ballistic missiles, nor drones, nor satellites, nor battleships, nor weapons of mass destruction.  How  could  we  fear  them,  while Allah the Exalted has said, {If Allah should aid you, no one can overcome you; but if He should forsake you, who is there that can aid you after Him? And upon Allah let the believers rely} [Āli ‘Imrān: 160]. How could we fear them, while Allah the Exalted has said, {So do not weaken and do not grieve, and you will be superior if you are [true] believers} [Āli ‘Imrān: 139].”\nother, for some people have entered your ranks who are not of you and are only claimants. And thus some disorder has occurred. So it has become  necessary  for  a  trial  to  come,  expel  the filth, and purify the ranks. We ask Allah for forgiveness and wellness.  Also, pride and  conceit has entered some of our souls, and thus some of us transgressed and oppressed others. So it is necessary for the sins to be expelled, so that you may return to your Lord. Allah has loved the mujāhidīn, and so there is no choice but for Him to take some martyrs. We ask Allah to make us of them, not from the disgraced nor those afflicted [in their religion].”\n“O America, O allies of America, and O crusaders,  know  that  the  matter  is  more  dangerous than  you  have  imagined  and  greater  than  you have envisioned. We have warned you that today we are in a new era, an era where the State, its soldiers, and its sons are leaders not slaves. They are a people who through the ages have not known defeat. The outcome of their battles is concluded before they begin. They have not prepared for a battle since the time of Noah except with absolute conviction of victory. Being killed – according to their account – is a victory. This is where the secret lies. You fight a people who can never be defeated.”\n“Therefore Allah will give you victory. Indeed, Allah will give you victory. By Allah, Allah will give you victory.  So  guarantee  for  us  two  matters,  and we will guarantee you – by Allah’s permission –  constant  victory  and  consolidation.  First,  do not  oppress  anyone  nor  be  content  with  oppression by being silent about it and not raising the matter to those in authority. Second, do not become conceited or arrogant. This is what we fear from you and fear for you.”\n“Thereafter know that a trial, sifting, and selection, are necessary between one period and an-\n“And so we promise you by Allah’s permission that this campaign will be your final campaign. It  will  be  broken  and  defeated,  just  as  all your  previous  campaigns  were  broken  and defeated, except that this time we will raid you  thereafter,  and  you  will  never  raid  us. \ndabiq\f"

And so immediately the Islamic  State  demanded  200  million  dollars from the Japanese government, the same sum initially committed to the crusaders and their apostate allies by the Japanese Prime Minister. The  Khilāfah  was  not  in  need  of  the  money and knew fully that the Japanese would never provide the sum, but it had decided – by this demand  –  to  humiliate  the  arrogance  of  this Japanese government… a government in a line of  governments  enslaved  by  the  West  since the Second World War.\nAfter  the  passing  of  the  first  deadline,  the Japanese prisoner Haruna Yukawa was executed while Japanese representatives rushed to the murtadd  Jordanian  regime.  The  Islamic  State immediately  requested  for  the  release  and transfer  of  Sājidah  ar-Rīshāwī  –  a  mujāhidah who was imprisoned by the Jordanian tāghūt for  almost  10  years  –  to  the  lands  of  the Khilāfah in exchange for Kenji Goto Jogo. The Jordanian  regime  recklessly  complicated  the process  for  the  Japanese  by  attempting  to include  their  pilot  in  the  exchange  deal,  but the  Khilāfah  explicitly  refused  such  during the  negotiations  with  the  representative  of the Jordanian tāghūt – ‘Āsim Tāhir al-Barqāwī (AKA Abū Muhammad al-Maqdisī1) – as there were other plans for the murtadd pilot. In the end, both al-Barqāwī’s murtadd client and the Japanese  prisoner  were  executed  due  to  the negligence  of  both  regimes  in  heeding  the warnings of the Islamic State. The relatives of Kenji Goto Jogo and the murtadd pilot have no one to blame but the political leaders of their lands  who  strive  to  appease  and  serve  the American crusaders.\nTHE JAPANESE CRUSADER KENJI GOTO JOGO\nJapan is now in a complicated predicament. How can it escape this threat? Can Abe Shinzo take the step to save his people whom he recklessly exposed to the wrath of the Khilāfah? Can he bravely announce the halting of his support for the  war  against  the  Khilāfah  after  making  his infamously  unwise  announcement  against  the Islamic State? That is very doubtful…\nPrior  to  Abe  Shinzo’s  thoughtless  pledge  of support for this crusade, Japan was not on the list of priorities to be targeted by the Islamic State, but through Abe Shinzo’s foolishness, all Japanese citizens and interests – wherever they may be found – are now a target for the soldiers and patrons of the Khilāfah everywhere.\nSo let his citizens know that the sword of the Khilāfah  has  been  unsheathed  against  the pagans of Japan by Allah’s might and power…_____________1   Perhaps Allah will facilitate a detailed exposure of how al-Barqāwī (whose campaign of lies carries on) represented the Jordanian tāghūt in these negotiations. Wallāhul-musta’ān…\n4 FOREWORD\n\fTHE MURTADD PILOT WAS KILLED IN RETALIATION FOR AIRSTRIKES AGAINST MUSLIMS SUCH AS THOSE PICTURED ABOVE\nIn  executing  the  mujāhidīn,  Jordan  is  merely hastening  the its tāghūt regime.\ninevitable  destruction  of \nAllah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said,  “Whoever  harms  an  ally  of  Mine,  then I  have  declared  war  against  him”  [Sahīh  alBukhārī].\nWhile the execution of Sājidah and Ziyād became the focus of international headlines, the focus for many ignorant hizbiyyīn became the manner in which the pilot was executed. Amongst them was the Jordanian Abū Sayyāf Muhammad ashShalabī, who stated, “The manner in which he was  executed  and  the  subsequent  production of a video displaying his execution is a matter that opposes the teachings of the pure religion. Jihād was legislated to make the people enter the religion, not to make them turn away from the religion or to distort its image.”1\nThis  type  of  rhetoric  is  typical  of  hizbiyyīn  – even  those  masquerading  as  supporters  of the  mujāhidīn  –  who  continue  to  live  under the  authority  of  the  murtadd  puppets,  and of  defeatist  Muslims  who  reside  in  the  lands of  kufr  under  the  authority  of  the  crusaders themselves, with no intention of making hijrah to those lands in which the word of Allah is the highest.  Such  people  have  had  their  religion diluted and, not surprisingly, are always amongst the  first  to  speak  out  in  any  case  where  the \n6 ARTICLE\nTHE LIAR ABŪ SAYYĀF\nmujāhidīn display their harshness towards the crusaders, attempting to disguise their criticism towards the mujāhidīn as concern for the image of Islam.\nIn burning the crusader pilot alive and burying him  under  a  pile  of  debris,  the  Islamic  State carried  out  a  just  form  of  retaliation  for  his involvement in the crusader bombing campaign which  continues  to  result  in  the  killing  of countless  Muslims  who,  as  a  result  of  these airstrikes,  are  burned  alive  and  buried  under mountains of debris. This is not to even mention _____________1   Abū Sayyāf ash-Shalabī exposed the full extent of his evil when displaying his remorse for the murtadd pilot in the face of the mujāhidīn. He also fabricated stories about the negotiations regarding the prisoners by claiming to be involved in these negotiations, whereas the representative of the Jordanian tāghūt from the beginning was ‘Āsim Tāhir al-Barqāwī (AKA Abū Muhammad al-Maqdisī,  whose  campaign  of  lies  carries  on).  Furthermore,  ash-Shalabī shamelessly lied by claiming that the murtadd Baathist ‘Izzat ad-Dūrī and other murtadd Baathists were members of the Islamic State and involved in the negotiations! So, a shameless liar – ash-Shalabī – is taken as a “jihādī mentor”! One can only say to him, “If you have no shame, then do as you wish” [Sahīh al-Bukhārī].\n\f"

Now that’s real money.\nIt’s  amazing  to  think  that  a  lump  of  gold  that may  have  been  used  for  trade  thousands  of years ago is still in circulation. It may have been melted down and be part of a bullion bar or it may be worn around someone’s neck, but it’s still around. Try that with a piece of paper.\nWHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT MONEY?\nLast month the Islamic State announced plans to mint their own range of gold dinars and silver dirhams in a move to separate themselves from dollar-linked fiat currencies and to establish their own money, a currency that has intrinsic value.\nAny  country  needs  its  own  currency  and  a move by the Islamic State to gold dinars would be a smart one in today’s turbulent markets. Financial website Quartz wrote, “The gold dinar taps into a deep history of Islamic coinage that stretches back almost to the time of Muhammad himself. The Islamic dinar appeared in 696 AD, when the Umayyad empire – based in Damascus – stretched from the Iberian peninsula to the Indus River in South Asia.”\nAnd the value of gold is soaring.

None  of  this  is  praiseworthy,  and  indeed the  Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  used to  seek  refuge  from  knowledge  that  does  not benefit [Reported by Muslim on the authority of Zayd]. In a hadīth reported from him he said, ‘Ask Allah for beneficial knowledge and seek refuge with Allah from knowledge that does not benefit’ [Reported by Ibn Mājah on the authority of Jābir]. In another hadīth reported from him he said, ‘Indeed, from knowledge is to be ignorant of some things’ [Reported by Abū Dāwūd on the authority of Buraydah]. The Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) disliked excessive and extensive speech, and loved concise speech. There are many ahādīth reported from him to that effect and they would take long to mention” [Majmū’ Rasā’il Ibn Rajab].\nHe  (rahimahullāh)  also  said,  “Ibn  Mas’ūd  also said, ‘You live in a time in which there are many scholars and few speakers, and there will come a time after you in which there will be few scholars and many speakers.’ Therefore, he who has extensive knowledge and speaks little is praiseworthy, and he who is the opposite is blameworthy.  The  Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam) attested  to  the  people  of  Yemen  having  īmān and fiqh. The people of Yemen are the least in speech from amongst the people and the least excessive in knowledge because their knowledge is beneficial knowledge in their hearts, and they only express with their tongues what they need to of that knowledge. And that is true fiqh and beneficial knowledge” [Fadl ‘Ilm as-Salaf].\nAfter  reading  “Fadl  ‘Ilm  as-Salaf  ‘Alā  ‘Ilm  alKhalaf”  by  al-Hāfidh  Ibn  Rajab  (rahimahullāh), \nhis  statement  “The  people  of  Yemen  are  the least in speech from amongst the people” stuck to my mind for years. I then witnessed it in reality firsthand in the bay’āt announced by the mujāhidīn of the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen, Sinai, Libya, and Algeria, for the shortest of the five statements was the statement of the mujāhidīn of Yemen. It contained wisdom, fiqh and īmān, and through it, they expressed their full conviction in a brief and concise manner. I ask Allah to make them firm upon their covenant so that they meet Allah while He is pleased with them.\nThe mujāhidīn of Yemen said, “Allah’s Messenger  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  had  given  us glad tidings of Khilāfah upon the methodology of prophethood. And indeed, by Allah, we have seen it as a Khilāfah upon the methodology of prophethood.  And  when  we  heard  the  trumpets  of  the  Jews  and  Christians  –  the  callers upon the gates of Hellfire – we answered the order of Allah’s Messenger that obliged sticking to the jamā’ah of the Muslims and their Imām, for Hudhayfah (radiyallāhu ‘anh) said, ‘The people used to ask Allah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) about good, and I used to ask him about evil, fearing that it might overtake me…’ In  the  hadīth,  he  says,  ‘Is  there  any  evil  after this good?’ He responded, ‘Yes, callers upon the gates of Hellfire. Whoever answers them will be thrown into it by them.’ He said, ‘O Allah’s Messenger, describe them to me.’ He said, ‘They are from our skin and speak with our tongues.’ He said, ‘So what do you order me with if I reach that time?’ He said, ‘Stick to the jamā’ah of the Muslims and their Imām’ [Al-Bukhārī and Muslim].”\nThus,  they  recognized  the  disease  –  splitting and differing – and they knew the cure – unity and rallying together. They understood that rallying together meant sticking to the jamā’ah of the Muslims (the Khilāfah) and their Imām (the Khalīfah), not rallying together upon factionalism and partisanship. So they spoke with the prophetic wisdom, and said “we hear and obey” without any reluctance, complication, or arrogance.\ndabiq\n\fABU HAMZAH AL-MUHAJIR TRAINING CAMP\nPHYSICAL TRAINING\nA MARTIAL ARTS DEMONSTRATION\nTACTICAL TRAINING\ndabiq\n\f"

Most prominent  among  those  killed  were the scholars Abū Jandal al-Azdī (Fāris Āl Shuwayl az-Zahrānī), Hamd al-Humaydī,  and  ‘Abdul-‘Azīz  at-Tuwayli’ī, may Allah accept them all amongst the shuhadā’. Allah  said, {And do not say of those killed in the path of Allah, “They are dead.” Rather, they are alive but you do not perceive} [Al-Baqarah: 154].\nSince the establishment of their present state, the Saudi regime is well known to have committed more than one nullifier of Islam. The images and videos of  Saudi  “royals”  dancing,  prancing, and even kissing their crusader counterparts  as  these  “royals”  support  the crusaders  in  the  wars  against  Islam and Muslims are famous enough that no one can deny their show of mutual love,  and  Allah    said,  {You  do  not find any people believing in Allah and the  Last  Day  having  mutual  love  for whoever opposed Allah and His Messenger}  [Al-Mujādilah:  22].\nBut for one reason or another, many ignorant people often neglect to recognize the reality of the regime’s palace scholars,  which  is  that  these  scholars \nThe  martyred  shaykh,  Abū  Jandal al-Azdī  (may  Allah  accept  him)\nThe martyred shaykh, Hamd al-Humaydī (may Allah accept him)\nare  undoubtedly  murtaddīn.  Their apostasy is even grosser than any other, having studied the clear texts proving their collapse into kufr. They have sought to justify the apostasy of their masters with deception, embroidering their arguments with misquoted āyāt, ahādīth, and āthār from the Salaf. In the  severest  terms,  they  have  advised the  youth  to  reject  the  true  meaning of jihād and to replace it with national pride. The “hukm of Allah” to them is whatever the Saudi governmental ministries have deemed acceptable. Therefore, it must be understood that these scholars are not simply silent bystanders in the background.\nRather, the palace scholars of the Saudi  regime  –  from  their  “Grand  Muftī”  ‘Abdul-‘Azīz  Āl  ash-Shaykh  to  the minions  who  spread  deceitful  protāghūt propaganda atop the pulpits of their “kingdom” – are at the forefront \nof  this  effort  to  dissuade  Muslims from  jihād  and  from  upholding  the Sharī’ah, averting them from the path of Allah. Hiding behind claims of being  “Sunnī,”  “Hanbalī,”  “Salafī,”  and especially descendants and students of Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhāb, they are truly nothing more than slaves of tāghūt,  waging  war  against  the  mujāhidīn in order to maintain the status quo. It was Ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhāb r who mentioned  among  the  ten  greatest nullifiers  of  Islam,  “Eighth:  Backing the mushrikīn and aiding them against the  Muslims.  The  evidence  is  His   saying, {And whoever allies with them of you, then indeed he is of them. Verily Allah does not guide the tyrannical people}” [Ar-Rasā’il ash-Shakhsiyyah].\nWhen asked about the clear disparity between  the  Qur’ān-backed  creed  of Muhammad  Ibn  ‘Abdil-Wahhāb  and the  Saudi  regime’s  constant  coalition with  crusaders  against  Muslims,  palace  scholar  Hātim  al-‘Awnī  criticized Ibn  ‘Abdil-Wahhāb  and  considered this one of the reasons for a required revision of the texts written by the historic scholars of Najd.\nIn  their  “justification”  of  murdering mujāhidīn, the Saudis stated that the plans of some of these brothers were “to damage the nation’s economy and harm  the  Kingdom’s  status  [and]  its relations  and  interests  with  brotherly and  friendly  countries,”  specifically mentioning  “by  storming  the  U.S. Consulate  in  Jeddah.”  Such  attacks on the regime’s brothers-in-kufr were \n\feat him” [Al-Badr at-Tāli’]. It is not surprising then to hear that when Ismā’īl defeated the emir of Merv, he dismembered him – dispatching his limbs across Persia – and covered his skull with gold and gems to use it as a chalice at social events.\nIsmā’īl’s  claim  was  that  he  received  instructions  from  the awaited “Mahdī,” becoming “Allah’s representative on earth” to usher in a new state and sponsor the 12 imāms considered “infallible”  by  the  Rāfidah.  Due  to  his  Sūfī  background,  he claimed to receive “ilhām ghaybī,” a kind of “gnostic inspiration,” resulting in his followers ascribing a divine status to him, even considering him “Allah’s spirit incarnate” – we seek refuge with Allah from such blatant kufr!\nWith the full support of the Qizilbāsh1 Rāfidī militia, Ismā’īl killed  scores  of  Muslims,  especially  targeting  any  scholars teaching  the  Sunnah.  He  massacred  thousands  upon  thousands and burned all the books of Ahlus-Sunnah, not even sparing  their  copies  of  the  Qur’ān.  Originally  hosting  an overwhelming  Sunni-majority  population,  Persia,  eastern Iraq, and Khurāsān were once bustling with knowledge conveyed by the likes of linguists Sībawayh and al-Azharī; hadīth masters al-Bukhārī and Muslim; mufassirīn at-Tabarī and alBaghawī;  and  fuqahā’  al-Marwazī  and  Ibnul-Mundhir.  But once controlled by the Safawiyyah, these lands became virtually void of scholarship.\nAn  age  of  darkness  quickly  spread  over  the  once  enlightened Persia. Ismā’īl and his descendants worked to forcefully convert the Sunni majority to the Rāfidī religion. The same took place in other Sunni majority lands, including Azerbaijan. Arab Rāfidī “scholars” from Lebanon, Bahrain, and Iraq were imported to teach their deviant tenets. The most famous of them – and one of the first to arrive – was ‘Alī Ibn al-Husayn al-Karakī (died 940AH), who was given the position of “Shaykhul-Islām” and put in charge of an official agency established to oversee the conversion of Ahlus-Sunnah. It was alKarakī who issued the fatāwā allowing Ithnā-‘Ashrī Rāfidah to use military force to establish their rule, thus “substantiating” Ismā’īl’s claims and justifying all of his abuses. Many Sunnis left Persia, but those who stayed were persecuted, having to decide to either apostatize or face death. Regarding this process and his cruelty to Ahlus-Sunnah, Ismā’īl said, “This matter concerns me not, as Allah and the infallible imāms are with me, so I fear no one. If any of my subjects voice any objection, I shall unsheathe my sword and leave none alive.”\nThe  adhān  was  altered  to  reflect  Rāfidī  “fiqh,”  adding  the phrase “ashhadu anna ‘alīyyan walīyullāh” (“I testify that ‘Alī is the walī of Allah”). Imāms were ordered to curse Abū Bakr as-Siddīq, ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattāb, and ‘Uthmān Ibn ‘Affān  during every Jumu’ah sermon.\n1   These were Turkic militias organized by Ismā’īl’s father and known as the Qizilbāsh (Turkish for “Redheads”) because of their crimson crowns of twelve gores each, representing their allegiance to the Twelver sect.\nSunni  graveyards  were  desecrated  and  their  masājid  destroyed. Tomé Pires, a crusader and Portuguese ambassador to China, who traveled through Persia during 916 and 917AH, witnessed this, saying, “He [Ismā’īl] renovates our churches yet destroys the masājid of Muslims who follow the Sunnah” [Summa  Oriental].\nIn imitation of Ibn Buwayh, a Rāfidī leader of the fourth century, Ismā’īl revived public observance of al-Husayn’s death, the rituals of which were described by Ibn Kathīr, who said, “Orders were given [by Ibn Buwayh] for the markets to close, for women to wear hair-woven sackcloths, and to go out with their faces and hair uncovered, as they slapped their faces and wailed  for  al-Husayn  Ibn  ‘Alī  Ibn  Abī  Tālib.  Ahlus-Sunnah were unable to prevent this due to the number of Shī’ah and their dominance, as the ruler was on the side of the Shī’ah” [Al-Bidāyah  wan-Nihāyah].\nFestivities marking the assassination of ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattāb r were also established during this time. This practice was supported  by  Muhammad  Bāqir  al-Majlisī  (died  1111AH), regarded as one of the most important Safawī palace “scholars” also given the title “Shaykhul-Islām” by the “shāh.” On celebrating  ‘Umar’s  death,  he  said,  “What  is  known  among Shī’ah in the major cities and lands of our present time is that it [the assassination of ‘Umar] was on the 9th of Rabī’ al-Awwal, and it is a day of celebration” [Bihār al-Anwār]. He then mentioned a fabricated report as evidence that this was the day of ‘Umar’s death (which was actually on the 26th of DhulHijjah) and that it is to be considered the greatest ‘īd for the supporters  of  Ahlul-Bayt!\nLike  present-day  Rāfidah,  the  Safawiyyah  were  known  for their allegiance to crusaders. Ismā’īl – then in control of Hormuz – allied with the crusader Portuguese between 921 and 927AH  to  assist  them  in  their  conquest  of  al-Bahrayn  and al-Qatīf in the eastern Arabian Peninsula, directly defying one of the Prophet’s final command’s to expel the mushrikīn from \nA  Rāfidī  shrine  in  Iran  dedicated  to  Abū Lu‘lu‘ah  al-Majūsī,  the  killer  of ‘Umar  h\n\f"

Depending upon Allah alone for success, Abū Muhārib with his companion embarked on a  long  and  strenuous  journey  that  totaled  approximately two months and involved trekking the mountain ranges of Europe and its marshy farmlands, sneaking across borders, and being detained by the authorities of various nations on at least two occasions. The journey required a great amount of patience and a high degree of security precautions, two things for which Abū Muhārib was well known.2\nThrough  their  persistence  and  perseverance,  Allah  granted  them  safe  deliverance  into  Shām  in  the  latter  part  of “2012.” Upon arrival, Abū Muhārib wasted no time and immediately placed his hand with the Jamā’ah, joining the Islamic State while it was operating under the name “Jabhat an-Nusrah,” prior to al-Jawlānī’s treachery. He was not deceived by the presence of hundreds of groups, or their numerous flags bearing their hypocritical logos and names. It would be through this very manner of foresight and decisiveness that Allah would grant Abū Muhārib steadfastness throughout the many trials which the Islamic State would encounter, including al-Jawlānī’s betrayal and nullification of his bay’ah to Amīrul-Mu’minīn Abu Bakr al-Baghdādī (hafidhahullāh). Abū Muhārib was among the very first to declare his disavowal of al-Jawlānī and would say regarding him, “He’s just going to be another Shaykh Sharīf,” referring to former head of the Islamic Courts Union of Somalia – Sharif Sheikh Ahmed – who committed blatant apostasy by entering into the parliaments of shirk and supporting the United States and African crusader nations in the war against Islam and the Muslims.\nIt was Abū Muhārib’s sincerity, ambition, and enthusiasm to work and tire himself for Allah’s sake that granted him prominence, as he grew to be loved and respected by many. He participated in the conquest of the Taftanāz airbase near Idlib and the 17th Division base near ar-Raqqah. He also partook in the operation in Salqīn near Idlib – where Abū Mu’āwiyah al-Misrī3 was martyred – as well as in many other battlefronts. He also participated in the fighting against the sahwāt of Shām and was injured within the first week of the Sahwah, sustaining a gunshot wound to his back during the battle to retake Huraytān.\nHis harshness towards the kuffar was manifested through deeds that enraged all the nations, religions, and factions of kufr, the entire world bearing witness to this. {That is be-\n2   Editor’s Note: Perhaps we release the story of his long hijrah in a future issue. 3   To read about Abū Mu’āwiyah al-Misrī and his best friend Abū Qudāmah al-Misrī (may Allah accept them both), see Dābiq, issue 7, “Among the Believers are Men,” pages 46-49. \ncause people are not afflicted by thirst or fatigue or hunger in the cause of Allah, nor do they tread on any ground that enrages the disbelievers, nor do they afflict the enemy with anything except that is registered for them as a righteous deed} [At-Tawbah: 120].\nA  side  of  Abū  Muhārib  that  wasn’t  witnessed  except  by those who knew him was his mercy, kindness, and generosity towards the believers, his protective jealousy for Islam and its people, and his affection towards the orphans. Of the deeds that attest to his kindness and generosity is that after receiving a sabiyyah (concubine) as a gift he did not hesitate to give her away – likewise as a gift – to an unmarried injured brother. And from the incidents that attest to his protective jealousy for Islam and its people is that after engaging in a debate with a Madkhalī (a pro-Saudi “Salafī”) in one of the “masājid” in the lands of kufr, the Madkhalī remarked regarding the abuses of the spiteful Jews against our sisters in Palestine that the women “deserved it.” Abū Muhārib had to be restrained from hitting this Madkhalī by other worshippers at the “masjid.” A brother who witnessed the incident recalled, “Abū Muhārib began to weep loudly. I watched him in his prayer weeping in sujūd as if he had lost a loved one.”\nAnd amongst the deeds that attest to his affection towards the orphans is that following the martyrdom of Bilāl al-Barjāwī, Abū Muhārib would frequently visit his orphaned son, taking him to the masājid and entertaining him with trips out to the park and the zoo. He would also teach Qur’ān to other sons of shuhadā’. {Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those with him are forceful against the kuffār, merciful  among  themselves.  You  see  them  bowing  and prostrating, seeking bounty from Allah and [His] pleasure. Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. That is their description in the Tawrāh. And their description in the Injīl is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers – so that Allah may enrage by them the kuffār. Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward} [Al-Fath: 29].\nOn Thursday, the 29th of Muharram, 1437, Abū Muhārib finally achieved shahādah for the cause of Allah, which he had sought for so long, as the car he was in was targeted in a strike by an unmanned drone in the city of ar-Raqqah, destroying the car and killing him instantly. May Allah accept our  brother  among  the  shuhadā’,  envelop  him  with  His mercy, and enter him into the highest levels of al-Firdaws.\n\f"

Then an army from Madīnah of the best people on the earth at that time will leave for them. When they line up in ranks the Romans will  say,  ‘Leave  us  and  those  who  were  enslaved from amongst us so we can fight them.’ The Muslims will say, ‘Nay, by Allah, we will not  abandon  our  brothers  to  you.’  So  they will  fight  them.  Then  one  third  of  them  will flee; Allah will never forgive them. One third of  them  will  be  killed;  they  will  be  the  best martyrs with Allah. And one third will conquer them; they will never be afflicted with fitnah. Then they will conquer Constantinople. While they are dividing the war booty, having hung their swords on olive trees, Shaytān will shout, ‘The [false] Messiah has followed after your families [who were left behind.]’ So they will leave [for their families], but Shaytān’s claim is false. When they arrive to Shām he comes out. Then when they are preparing for battle and filing their ranks, the prayer is called. So ‘Īsā Ibn Maryam (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) will descend and lead them. When the enemy of Allah sees him, he will melt as salt melts in  water.  If  he  were  to  leave  him  he  would melt until he perished, but he kills him with his own hand, and then shows them his blood upon his spear” [Sahīh Muslim].\nAllah’s  Messenger  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam) said, “You will have a treaty of security with the Romans until you both fight an enemy beyond them. And you will be victorious, you will gain war booty, and you will achieve such  without  losses.  Thereafter  you  will  return  until  you  lodge  at  a  pastureland  full  of rocky mounds. A man from the Roman Christians will then raise the cross. He will say, ‘The cross has prevailed!’ A man from the Muslims \nwill  then  say,  ‘Rather  Allah  has  prevailed,’  and then he will angrily rise and crush the cross, which is not at a distance from him. Then the Romans will betray the treaty by rising against the breaker of the cross and striking his neck. The Muslims will  then  rise  and  rush  to  their  arms.  They  will then battle. Allah will bless this party of Muslims with shahādah. The Romans will say to the Roman leader, ‘We are sufficient for you against the Arabs.’ They will then gather for the Malhamah (the grand battle before the Hour). They will come for you under eighty banners, with each banner there will be twelve thousand people” [Sahīh – reported by Imām Ahmad, Abū Dāwūd, Ibn Mājah, Ibn Hibbān, and al-Hākim on the authority of Dhī Mikhmar].\ndabiq\fTHE ENEMY’S WORDS\n“\nISIL poses a real threat to all countries in the Middle East, our European allies and to America.\nIn the last few months, the world has seen ISIL’s barbarity up close as its fighters advanced across western and northern Iraq and slaughtered thousands of innocent civilians,  including  Sunni  and  Shia  Muslims  and Kurdish Iraqis and religious minorities.  ISIL’s murder of two US journalists outraged the American people and exposed to the world the depravity of ISIL’s ideology and tactics.  Over the weekend, we saw ISIL’s murder of a British citizen. ISIL now controls a vast swath of eastern Syria and western and northern Iraq including towns and cities in all these areas.\nISIL has gained strength by exploiting the civil war in Syria and sectarian strife in Iraq.  And it has seized territory  across  both  countries  and  acquired  significant resources and advanced weapons. ISIL has employed a violent combination of terrorist, insurgent and conventional military tactics.\nISIL has been very adept at deploying technology and social media to increase its global profile and attract tens  of  thousands  of  fighters.  Its  goal  is  to  become the  new  vanguard  of  a  global  extremist  movement and establish an extremist Islamic caliphate across the Middle East. It considers itself the rightful inheritor of Osama bin Laden’s legacy.\nWhile ISIL clearly poses an immediate threat to American  citizens  in  Iraq  and  our  interests  in  the  Middle East, we also know that thousands of foreign fighters, including  Europeans  and  more  than  100  Americans have travelled to Syria.  With passports that give them relative freedom of movement, these fighters can exploit ISIL’s safe haven to plan, coordinate and carry out attacks against the United States and Europe.\nAlthough the intelligence community has not yet detected specific plotting against the US homeland, ISIL has  global  aspirations.  And  as  President  Obama  has made clear, ISIL’s leaders have threatened America and our allies. If left unchecked, ISIL will directly threaten our homeland and our allies.\n”\n\f"

The Sīrah is a witness to our Prophet’s (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) raiding of the kuffār. He would kill their men and enslave their children and women. The raids of the beloved Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) convey this to  us.  Ask  the  tribes  of  Banī  al-Mustaliq,  Banī Quraydhah, and Hawāzin about this.\nIbn ‘Awn said, “I wrote to Nāfi’, so he wrote back to me saying, ‘The Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam)  raided  Banī  al-Mustaliq  while  they  were not  expecting  it  and  while  their  cattle  were  out drinking water. So he killed their fighters, enslaved their children, and gained Juwayriyah. Ibn ‘Umar told  me  this.  And  he  was  part  of  that  army’” [Reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim].\nAfter  the  Battle  of  the Trench,  Banī  Quraydhah yielded  to  the  judgment  of  Sa’d  Ibn  Mu’ādh (radiyallāhu ‘anh). So Sa’d said, “I rule that their fighters be killed and their families be enslaved.” So Allah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said,  “You  have  indeed  judged  in  their  affair  by the ruling of Allah” [Reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim].\nThe  number  of  Jews  killed  in  the  battles  of Khaybar  reached  93  men  [Maghāzī  al-Wāqidī]. Their  women  and  children  were  enslaved,  and Safiyyah Bint Huyayy Ibn Akhtab – the Mother of  the  Believers  (radiyallāhu  ‘anhā)  –  fell  into captivity. Allah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) set her free and married her [Reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim].\nAnd  during  the  expedition  of  Hunayn,  Allah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) enslaved from Hawāzin until the amount of slaves reached six thousand [At-Tabaqāt al-Kubrā – Ibn Sa’d].\nThe scholars of Sīrah mentioned that the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) took four slave-girls as  concubines,  two  of  them  being  Māriyah  alQibtiyyah  and  Rayhānah  an-Nadriyyah  [Zād  alMa’ād].\nThe Sahābah and their followers in goodness treaded upon the path of the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) after him. Therefore, we almost cannot find a companion who didn’t practice saby. ‘Alī Ibn Abī Tālib (radiyallāhu ‘anh) had nineteen slave-girls. Ibn ‘Uyaynah reported that ‘Amr Ibn Dīnār said, “’Alī Ibn Abī Tālib wrote in his will, ‘As to what follows: If something happens to me during this battle, then my slave-girls whom I copulate with are nineteen in number. Some of them bore me children, some of them are pregnant, and some of them are childless’” [Musannaf ‘Abdir-Razzāq].\nAbū Sa’īd al-Khudrī (radiyallāhu ‘anh) said, “I had a slave-girl with whom I used to practice withdrawal. She  bore  me  the  most  beloved  of  people  to  me” [Musannaf ‘Abdir-Razzāq].\nAfter  all  this  and  after  the  sun  of  the  Khilāfah radiated once again, and the winds of victory and consolidation  blew,  and  the  Islamic  State,  by  the grace  of  its  Lord  alone,  brought  out  the  Islamic punishments and rulings of the Sharī’ah from the darkness of books and papers, and we truly lived them after they were buried for centuries… After all this, the ramblers dare to extend their tongues with false rumors and accusations so as to disfigure the great shar’ī ruling and pure prophetic Sunnah titled “saby”? After all this, saby becomes fornication and tasarrī (taking a slave-girl as a concubine) becomes rape? If only we’d heard these falsehoods from the kuffār who are ignorant of our religion. Instead we hear  it  from  those  associated  with  our  Ummah, those whose names are Muhammad, Ibrāhīm, and ‘Alī! So I say in astonishment: Are our people awake or asleep? But what really alarmed me was that some of the Islamic State supporters (may Allah forgive them) rushed to defend the Islamic State – may its honor  persist  and  may  Allah  expand  its  territory –  after  the  kāfir  media  touched  upon  the  State’s capture  of  the  Yazīdī  women.  So  the  supporters started denying the matter as if the soldiers of the Khilāfah had committed a mistake or evil.\nThus, after the matter transcended its limits and the barking of the charlatans – the wicked scholars – rose upon the pulpits of deviance, it became necessary to face their declarations with a declaration, but one \ndabiq\n\fcompletely and decreed it would be so. {And fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion is completely for Allah. And if they cease – then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do} [Al-Anfāl: 39]. {It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over  all  religions,  even  if  the  mushrikīn  despise such} [At-Tawbah: 33]. {And sufficient is Allah as a witness} [Al-Fath: 28].\nhimself testified. {[Iblīs] said, “My Lord, because You  have  put  me  in  error,  I  will  surely  make [disobedience] attractive to them on earth, and I will mislead them all except, among them, Your sincere  servants.”  [Allah]  said,  “This  is  a  path [of  return]  to  Me  [that  is]  straight.  Indeed,  My servants – no authority will you have over them, except  those  who  follow  you  of  the  deviators”} [Al-Hijr: 39-42].\nAnd despite their weakness and the weakness of their  master,  Shaytān,  they  plotted  for  his  sake. And  so  they  became  the  object  of  the  firm  plot of the best and swiftest of plotters, without them realizing it. {And they plotted, but Allah plotted. And  Allah  is  the  best  of  plotters}  [Āl  ‘Imrān: 54]. {Then did they feel secure from the plot of Allah?  But  no  one  feels  secure  from  the  plot  of Allah except those people in loss} [Al-A’rāf: 99]. {And when We give the people a taste of mercy after  adversity  has  touched  them,  at  once  they plot  against  Our  verses.  Say,  “Allah  is  swifter  in plot.” Indeed, Our messengers record that which you plot} [Yūnus: 21]. {And I will give them time. Indeed, my plot is firm} [Al-A’rāf: 183]. {Or do they  intend  a  plot?  But  those  who  disbelieve  – they are the object of a plot} [At-Tūr: 42].\nAnd Allah weakened their plots and led them to failure,  misguidance,  and  severe  error.  {Rather, their  [own]  plot  has  been  made  attractive  to those who disbelieve, and they have been averted from the way. And whomever Allah leaves astray – there will be for him no guide} [Ar-Ra’d: 33]. {But they who plot evil deeds will have a severe punishment,  and  the  plotting  of  those  –  it  will perish} [Fātir: 10]. {And Allah does not guide the plot of betrayers} [Yūsuf: 52]. {But the plot of the disbelievers is not except in error} [Ghāfir: 25].\nAnd  the  outcome  of  their  plots  is  the  exact opposite  of  what  they  desire.  They  only  plotted against  themselves,  their  worldly  life,  and  their hereafter,  bringing  about  their  debasement  and self-destruction.  {And  they  plotted  a  plot,  and We plotted a plot, while they perceived not. Then look how was the outcome of their plot – that We destroyed them and their people, all. So those are \ndabiq\nThe crusader John Kerry and the IranianRāfidī Mohammad Javad Zarif\nBut  due  to  the  deviance  and  arrogance  of  the enemies  of  Allah,  they  plot  against  His  religion and  His  allies.  Their  plots  almost  cause  the mountains to collapse out of shock that the kuffār dare to oppose the Lord of the heavens and the earth. {And they had plotted their plot, but with Allah is their plot [recorded], even if their plot had been [sufficient] to do away with the mountains} [Ibrāhīm: 46].\nAnd yet their plot is inherently weak, as it is part of the weak plot of Shaytān. {Those who believe fight in  the  cause  of  Allah,  and  those  who  disbelieve fight in the cause of tāghūt. So fight against the allies of Shaytān. Indeed, the plot of Shaytān has ever been weak} [An-Nisā: 76].\nAnd this weakness is due to the power of sincerity –  the  core  of  tawhīd  –  granted  by  Allah  to  the slaves  He  has  chosen,  as  the  accursed  Shaytān \n\f"

The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt Him. And there is not a thing except that it celebrates His praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting.  Indeed,  He  is  ever  Forbearing  and  Forgiving” (Al-Isra 42-44).\nHe c also said, “Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, ‘Come both of you, willingly or by compulsion.’ They said, ‘We have come willingly’” (Fussilat 11). He c also said, “Had there been within the heavens and earth gods besides Allah, they both would have been ruined. So exalted is Allah, Lord of the Throne, above what they describe” (Al-Anbiya 22).\nIn these various verses, Allah c teaches His slaves that the universe He created manifests recognition of His lordship and worship of Him alone by exalting His  praise  and  prostrating  to  Him  solely.  This  submission only to Him is behind the uniformity in the creation and what it contains of laws decreed by Him. If the creation had taken a god alongside its creator, obeying Allah and obeying a false god, loving Allah and loving a false god, and fearing Allah and fearing a false god, order would collapse within the universe.Allah c also created man and instilled in him the fitrah,  a  disposition  to  recognize  His  lordship  and worship  Him  alone.  Allah  c  said,  “So  direct  your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of Allah.  That  is  the  correct  religion,  but  most  of  the people do not know” (Ar-Rum 30).\nHe  c  made  this  fitrah  a  proof  against  mankind, saying, “And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam – from their loins – their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], ‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said, ‘Yes, we have testified’ – lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, ‘Indeed, we were of this unaware.’ Or [lest] you say, ‘It was only that our fathers associated [others in worship] with Allah before, and we were but descendants after them. Then would You destroy us for what the falsifiers have done?’” (Al-A’raf 172173).\nSigmund Freud, one of the engineers of Western decadence\nfilthiness,  between  decency  and  obscenity,  between mercy and cruelty, between justice and tyranny, between  truth  and  falsehood,  and  between  right  and wrong. In this regards, the Prophet g  said, “Every child is born upon the fitrah. His parents then make him a Jew or a Christian, just as you breed camels. Do you see any camels with their body parts mutilated until you yourselves mutilate them?” Abu Hurayrah  said, “Read if you wish, ‘…the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people; no change should there be in the creation of Allah…’” (Muslim). In this regards,  Allah  c  said,  “[The  polytheists]  supplicate none but a rebellious Satan, whom Allah has cursed for he had said, ‘I will surely take a prescribed portion from among Your servants. And I will mislead them, and I will arouse in them [sinful] desires, and I will command them so they will slit the ears of cattle, and I will command them so they will change the creation of Allah.’ And whoever takes Satan as an ally instead of Allah has certainly incurred a clear loss” (An-Nisa 117-119).\nThus, because the fitrah stands in the face of Satan as he attempts to deviate mankind from monotheism and purity to paganism and obscenity, he strives to obliterate this fitrah, as described by Allah c in the \nSo this fitrah is what causes man to distinguish between monotheism and polytheism. It also aids him in  generally  distinguishing  between  pureness  and \n\fof Islam? “Verily those who committed riddah, going back after the guidance had become clear to them, it is Satan who tempted them” (Muhammad 25). “And whoever  of  you  commits  riddah  from  his  religion, then dies as a disbeliever, then his deeds are void in this life and the next, and such are the companions of the Fire, forever therein” (Al-Baqarah 217).\nRemember that Allah did not order you to adhere to any group except that of the single Muslim nation, and rather forbade you to divide by making and joining other groups, as He c said, “Verily a single nation is your nation, and I am your Lord, so worship Me” (Al-Anbiya 92), “And do not be of the pagans, those who  divided  their  religion  and  became  sects,  each party delighted with itself” (Ar-Rum 32), “And hold tightly to the rope of Allah and do not separate” (Al ‘Imran 103), and, “He has called you ‘Muslims’” (AlHajj 78). That one nation is the group following the Quran and the Sunnah, with allegiance to one leader, the Caliph of the Muslims. Referring to when there shall appear “callers to the gates of Hell,” who are “of our skin and our language” and whose followers will be thrown into the Fire, our Prophet g commanded that we “adhere to the group of the Muslims and their leader” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim); yes, the single group of the Muslims and their single leader, around whom they unite and fulfill Allah’s command, “O you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those of authority amongst you” (An-Nisa 59).\nDo you not see the many so-called “imams” and “scholars” calling to alliances against Islam with the disbelievers, to maintaining the Muslim nation’s separation by imaginary borders, and to rejecting the reestablishment  of  the  Caliphate,  which  many  of  the earlier scholars called “the most important of obligations?!” Are these imams not “of our skin and our language,” yet call to what would inevitably lead to our doom? Indeed, they are callers to the gates of Hell, so beware and do not be fooled by them.\nSo reject these calls to disunity and come together. Live the life of Islam, for which you have already left the path of falsehood, and do not die the death of  Jahiliyyah,  a  time  in  which  there  was  no  united Muslim nation having pledged allegiance to a single imam and thus having no obedience to a rightful authority. Indeed, the Prophet g said, “Whoever dies unbound by a bay’ah (pledge of allegiance) has died a jahili death” (Muslim). And he said, “Whoever dislikes something in his leader, let him be patient. For whoever leaves the obedience of lawful authority, even \nBeware of dying as an apostate\na hand span (and dies), has died the death of Jahiliyyah” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nAt the onset of Ramadan in 1435, the mujahidin, who were engaging fierce battles against the Crusaders, their allies, and their puppets in Iraq and the Levant, reached a level where all conditions required to announce the Caliphate were met. So with great joy, the lost obligation was revived and the Muslim world could once again be united, by Allah’s grace, around a single imam, Ibrahim Ibn ‘Awwad al-Badri .\nRegardless of where you are, know that pledging allegiance is an obligation upon you, as is listening to your leader, the Caliph, and obeying his command. Allah’s Messenger g said, “The Muslim must listen and obey in what he loves and what he hates, as long as he is not commanded with a sin. If he is commanded with a sin, there is neither listening nor obeying (in that sin)” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nRush to perform hijrah (emigration) to the land of Islam, where the Shari’ah is in full application. Hijrah is a sign of both one’s love for unity and his adherence to the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger g. This was reiterated as a direct order from Amirul-Muminin, who said, “O Muslims everywhere, whoever is capable of performing hijrah to the Islamic State, then let him do so, because hijrah to the land of Islam is obligatory” (A Message to the Mujahidin and the Muslim Ummah).\nBut  if  you  are  unable  to  do  so,  then  know  that \n\f"

The author of the piece r did not suffice with seeking knowledge and training, but instead led the battle against Āl Salūl until he achieved shahādah for Allah’s sake. May Allah accept him, reward him, and bless him.]\nI am pleased to present my advice to the mujāhidīn in particular, and the Muslims in general through “Sawtul-Jihād” magazine.\nThe first piece of advice – following my advice to fear Allah and be mindful of Him – is to listen to and obey those whom Allah has given authority over the affairs of the mujāhidīn.\nThe Ummah today has been afflicted by the treacherous, apostate rulers and leaders who have even violated the rights \nof Allah in addition to the rights of His creation. And it is known that the authority of these rulers is invalid, and that it is obligatory to oppose them and wage war against them. But what is meant by listening and obeying here is in reference to those whom Allah has given authority over the affairs of jihād [and now, the Khilāfah]. This is a very important and very serious matter, which the Wise legislator has urged. And His Messenger g has made disobedience of one’s leader similar to disobedience of the Prophet g. Listening and obeying is from unity, cooperation, and strength,  in  contrast  with  quarrelling,  disunity,  and  disagreement.\nQuarrelling  and  disagreement  in  jihād  is  considered  a means of failure and defeat. {And do not dispute and [thus] lose courage and [then] your strength would depart; and be patient. Indeed, Allah is with the patient} [Al-Anfāl: 46].\nHe who studies history and Sīrah sees that disobeying the \n99\nADVICE TO THE MUJĀHIDĪN: LISTEN AND OBEY\n\fSince the de-“Islamization” of the nationalist “Islamic” sahwāt began – those factions having loyalty towards the Arab and Turkish tawāghīt – not a month passes without a declaration of nationalism and democracy being released by the allies of al-Qā’idah in Shām. The tawāghīt are ordered by the crusaders to pressure the sahwāt into announcing more and more concessions for continued military and non-military aid to reach them as well as for them to gain international political support and air cover from the crusaders.\nThe concessions will not end, and thus their apostasy becomes more and more blatant for none to doubt, not even the most deviant Murji’.1 It’s reached the point that even some within the Jawlānī front realized its allies were too shameless for the Jawlānī front to continue to openly support.2 And so former alliances were scaled back, downplayed, or ignored, reaching the point that the Jawlānī front publically coordinated a handover of their frontline posts to the Shāmiyyah Front, an open ally of the American crusaders and Turkish tawāghīt. It was not a mere withdrawal brought about by nonexistent military pressure but a coordinated handover by the Jawlānī front leadership documented in photos released by their close ally. This “withdrawal” was meant to present an image to the Jawlānī front “muhājirīn” that their leadership does not cooperate with the agents of America. \n1 Although the reality of the nationalist factions was always known by the leadership of the jihād claimants, they used the claims of the Murji’ah to treat the apostate and hypocritical factions as Muslims and to justify their alliance with them against the Islamic State. See Dābiq, issue 8, “Irjā’: The Most Dangerous Bid’ah,” pages 39-56. See also Dābiq, issue 10, “Interview with Abū Samīr al-Urdunī,” pages 70-76.2 See in this issue, “In the Words of the Enemy.”\nBut  does  a  “jihād”  group  hand  over  its  posts  to  crusader agents backed by crusader jets to fight against Muslims?\nIn any event, over the last couple of months three major declarations were released by the nationalist allies of al-Qā’idah in Shām. All three declarations reek of nationalism and democracy.\nOn “15 September 2015,” a declaration was released by the “Syrian revolutionary factions” in which they said:\n“The  representatives  of  the  Syrian  revolutionary  fighting factions  have  met  together  and  discussed  the  presidential statement  by  the  UN  Security  Council  issued  on  August 17, 2015, as well as the plan proposed by the UN envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura. The meeting factions have acknowledged that the statement by the UN Security Council could provide an enabling environment for starting an objective political negotiation and trust-building among all parties. The meeting factions have reached a consensus on the following:”\n“1. We welcome the call to start a political process that leads to a political transition according to the Geneva Communiqué that stipulates establishing a transitional governing body that starts functioning as soon as an agreement on a solution is reached, and thus, performing all executive authorities, including those of the President of the Republic.”\n“2.  We  emphasize  the  precondition  of  the  departure  of Bashar al-Assad and all the pillars of his regime, and that none of them would have a place or a role in the new Syria or the transitional phase.”\n1111\nTHE ALLIES OF AL-QĀ‘IDAH IN SHĀM: THE END\n\f"

Depending upon Allah alone for success, Abū Muhārib with his companion embarked on a  long  and  strenuous  journey  that  totaled  approximately two months and involved trekking the mountain ranges of Europe and its marshy farmlands, sneaking across borders, and being detained by the authorities of various nations on at least two occasions. The journey required a great amount of patience and a high degree of security precautions, two things for which Abū Muhārib was well known.2\nThrough  their  persistence  and  perseverance,  Allah  granted  them  safe  deliverance  into  Shām  in  the  latter  part  of “2012.” Upon arrival, Abū Muhārib wasted no time and immediately placed his hand with the Jamā’ah, joining the Islamic State while it was operating under the name “Jabhat an-Nusrah,” prior to al-Jawlānī’s treachery. He was not deceived by the presence of hundreds of groups, or their numerous flags bearing their hypocritical logos and names. It would be through this very manner of foresight and decisiveness that Allah would grant Abū Muhārib steadfastness throughout the many trials which the Islamic State would encounter, including al-Jawlānī’s betrayal and nullification of his bay’ah to Amīrul-Mu’minīn Abu Bakr al-Baghdādī (hafidhahullāh). Abū Muhārib was among the very first to declare his disavowal of al-Jawlānī and would say regarding him, “He’s just going to be another Shaykh Sharīf,” referring to former head of the Islamic Courts Union of Somalia – Sharif Sheikh Ahmed – who committed blatant apostasy by entering into the parliaments of shirk and supporting the United States and African crusader nations in the war against Islam and the Muslims.\nIt was Abū Muhārib’s sincerity, ambition, and enthusiasm to work and tire himself for Allah’s sake that granted him prominence, as he grew to be loved and respected by many. He participated in the conquest of the Taftanāz airbase near Idlib and the 17th Division base near ar-Raqqah. He also partook in the operation in Salqīn near Idlib – where Abū Mu’āwiyah al-Misrī3 was martyred – as well as in many other battlefronts. He also participated in the fighting against the sahwāt of Shām and was injured within the first week of the Sahwah, sustaining a gunshot wound to his back during the battle to retake Huraytān.\nHis harshness towards the kuffar was manifested through deeds that enraged all the nations, religions, and factions of kufr, the entire world bearing witness to this. {That is be-\n2   Editor’s Note: Perhaps we release the story of his long hijrah in a future issue. 3   To read about Abū Mu’āwiyah al-Misrī and his best friend Abū Qudāmah al-Misrī (may Allah accept them both), see Dābiq, issue 7, “Among the Believers are Men,” pages 46-49. \ncause people are not afflicted by thirst or fatigue or hunger in the cause of Allah, nor do they tread on any ground that enrages the disbelievers, nor do they afflict the enemy with anything except that is registered for them as a righteous deed} [At-Tawbah: 120].\nA  side  of  Abū  Muhārib  that  wasn’t  witnessed  except  by those who knew him was his mercy, kindness, and generosity towards the believers, his protective jealousy for Islam and its people, and his affection towards the orphans. Of the deeds that attest to his kindness and generosity is that after receiving a sabiyyah (concubine) as a gift he did not hesitate to give her away – likewise as a gift – to an unmarried injured brother. And from the incidents that attest to his protective jealousy for Islam and its people is that after engaging in a debate with a Madkhalī (a pro-Saudi “Salafī”) in one of the “masājid” in the lands of kufr, the Madkhalī remarked regarding the abuses of the spiteful Jews against our sisters in Palestine that the women “deserved it.” Abū Muhārib had to be restrained from hitting this Madkhalī by other worshippers at the “masjid.” A brother who witnessed the incident recalled, “Abū Muhārib began to weep loudly. I watched him in his prayer weeping in sujūd as if he had lost a loved one.”\nAnd amongst the deeds that attest to his affection towards the orphans is that following the martyrdom of Bilāl al-Barjāwī, Abū Muhārib would frequently visit his orphaned son, taking him to the masājid and entertaining him with trips out to the park and the zoo. He would also teach Qur’ān to other sons of shuhadā’. {Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those with him are forceful against the kuffār, merciful  among  themselves.  You  see  them  bowing  and prostrating, seeking bounty from Allah and [His] pleasure. Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. That is their description in the Tawrāh. And their description in the Injīl is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers – so that Allah may enrage by them the kuffār. Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward} [Al-Fath: 29].\nOn Thursday, the 29th of Muharram, 1437, Abū Muhārib finally achieved shahādah for the cause of Allah, which he had sought for so long, as the car he was in was targeted in a strike by an unmanned drone in the city of ar-Raqqah, destroying the car and killing him instantly. May Allah accept our  brother  among  the  shuhadā’,  envelop  him  with  His mercy, and enter him into the highest levels of al-Firdaws.\n\fnor is she to dye her hair or apply kohl” [Reported by Abū Dāwūd and an-Nasā’ī from Umm Salamah].\nA woman came to the Messenger of Allah  and said, “O Messenger  of  Allah,  my  daughter’s  husband  passed  away and she complains of pain in her eye. Should I apply kohl to her?” The Messenger of Allah  said, “No,” two or three times  [Reported  by  al-Bukhārī  and  Muslim  from  Umm Salamah].\nIbn ‘Abbās  said, “He would forbid the one whose husband  passed  away  from  using  perfume  and  adornment” [Musannaf  Ibn  Abī  Shaybah].\nAs for the use of dyes in clothing, then those “that are not intended for adornment – like the color black or what is dyed  to  make  something  look  less  appealing  or  to  cover up  blemishes  –  are  not  prohibited”  [Zād  al-Ma’ād  –  Ibnul-Qayyim]. Ibnul-Mundhir r (died 319AH) also said that both Mālik and ash-Shāfi’ī considered it permissible for the mourning widow to wear black “because it is not an adornment and it is the clothing of grief” [Naylul-Awtār – Ash-Shawkānī]. And Allah knows best.\nAdditionally,  the  mourning  widow  must  complete  her ‘iddah in the house in which she lived when her husband died, whether it is his property or a rental. The sister of Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī  went to the Messenger of Allah  to ask him for permission to return to her family from Banī Khudrah, explaining that her husband went out searching for some runaway slaves, but was killed by them when he found them. She said, “I asked Allah’s Messenger  that I return to my family, as my husband left me no home and no spending money.” The Messenger of Allah  approved, but when she left, he called for her and said, “What did you ask?” She repeated the story about her husband to him. He said, “Stay in your house in which you received the news of your husband’s death until the appointed time is reached.” She said, “So I counted my ‘iddah therein for four months and ten days.” She continued, “Then when ‘Uthmān asked me about that [during his khilāfah], I informed him of the matter. So he adhered to it and ruled accordingly” [Reported in the four Sunan and declared sahīh by at-Tirmidhī, Ibn Hibbān, and al-Hākim].\nAt-Tirmidhī r said, “This hadīth is hasan sahīh and most of the scholars from the Sahābah and others acted thereon. They did not allow the woman in her ‘iddah to move from her husband’s house until her ‘iddah ended. This is the opinion of Sufyān ath-Thawrī, ash-Shāfi’ī, Ahmad, and Ishāq.”\nSo this hadīth proves that the mourning widow must stay in the home in which she resided with her husband. This is the opinion of most scholars. ‘Uthmān Ibn ‘Affān – the Rightly-Guided Khalīfah – also ruled according to this in \nthe presence of the Muhājirīn and the Ansār. It was also the opinion of the second Rightly-Guided Khalīfah ‘Umar and his son, as well as Ibn Mas’ūd and others from the Sahābah, may Allah be pleased with all of them.\nAs such, it is harām for the mourning widow to move from her home to another except with a lawful excuse, as was explained by Ibn Qudāmah, who said, “If she fears demolition of the house, drowning therein, an approaching enemy, or something along these lines, or the owner of the house wishes to move her elsewhere, such as him lending the house then changing his mind, or its lease has ended, or he wrongfully expels her from the house or refuses to renew the lease, or he demands more than its going price, or she cannot afford it except from her own wealth, then she is allowed to move, as such situations are excusable and she is not required to pay for housing [from her own wealth], but her only obligation is that of residing there, not in obtaining the place itself. If she is unable to reside there [for reasons mentioned earlier], the obligation falls” [Al-Mughnī].\nAnd while the mourning widow spends her ‘iddah residing at her husband’s home, if she has any needs to attend to, then she can do so during the day, as night is a time that causes suspicions to arise. But, if she can find someone to run errands and take care of other needs for her, then the best place for her is her home. When she does go out for a need, she has to be back by maghrib (sunset). Lastly, she can’t sleep anywhere except at her home.\nIbn ‘Umar  said, “It is not right that she should spend a single night, during the ‘iddah of either death or divorce, except in her home” [Musannaf ‘Abdir-Razzāq].\nAnd while Ibn ‘Umar’s daughter  was in her ‘iddah after the passing away of her husband, she would visit her family during the day and speak with them; but as night fell, he would order her to return to her house [Musannaf ‘Abdir-Razzāq].\nLikewise, some women from Hamdān who were informed of their husbands passing away told Ibn Mas’ūd h, “We are feeling very lonely.” So he said to them, “Gather with one another during the day, then each woman should return to her home at night” [Musannaf ‘Abdir-Razzāq]. Of course, such gatherings should not become the norm, in adherence to the āyah, {And abide in your houses} [Al-Ahzāb: 33]. These gatherings should also be free of gossip, backbiting, and other sins. And the mourning widow must observe the rulings of ihdād therein. These occasional gatherings ought to serve a purpose such as worship, learning the religion, or keeping family ties.\nThus,  the  mourning  widow  should  remember  that  the Muslimāt – widows or not – do not leave their homes ex-\n\f"

        "@value": "The Rāfidah and the Jews\nWho Was Ibn Saba’?\nThe Jew Ibn Saba’, like Paul, hated Islam and desired to deviate the Muslims and corrupt their religion by innovating deviant concepts including the godhood, lordship, and second coming of ‘Alī Ibn Abī Tālib h. At the same time, he strived to create strife amongst the Muslim ranks, inciting against the Righteous Khalīfah ‘Uthmān h until ‘Uthmān was killed. The killing of ‘Uthmān led to the deaths of more Muslims and the eventual emergence of the Khawārij, who assassinated ‘Alī h, who Ibn Saba’ had once claimed was Allah!\nAbout him, Ibn Taymiyyah r said, “The first to innovate Rafd was a heretical hypocrite named ‘Abdullāh Ibn Saba’. He wanted thereby to corrupt the religion of the Muslims like Paul – the author of the letters read by the Christians – innovated for the Christians heresies by which he corrupted their religion. Paul was a Jew who hypocritically faked Christianity with the intent to corrupt it. Ibn Saba’ was also a Jew intending the same. He strived to spread falsehood aiming to corrupt the religion, but was unable to do so. However,  some  discord  and  strife  occurred  amongst  the Muslims, strife in which ‘Uthmān h was killed. Thereafter the fitnah transpired” [Majmū’ al-Fatāwā].\nAt-Tabarī r said in his tārīkh, “Ibn Saba’ adopted Islam during the khilāfah of ‘Uthmān. He then toured the Muslims’ lands, trying to deviate them. He started with al-Hijāz, then al-Basrah, then al-Kūfah, then ash-Shām. He did not succeed in launching his plot amongst the people of Shām. They eventually expelled him. He then went to Egypt and called its people. Amongst what he said to them was, ‘How strange are a people who claim that ‘Īsā will return but deny that  Muhammad  will  return,  whereas  Allah   said,  {Indeed,  He  who  imposed  upon  you  the  Qur’ān  will  bring you back to a returning place} [Al-Qasas: 85].2 Therefore, 2   The scholars of tafsīr say that the verse was a promise to the Prophet  that he would once again return to Makkah after being forced out from it.\nThe Tābi’ī ash-Sha’bī r (died 104AH) said, “I warn you against the followers of deviant desires. And the worst of them are the Rāfidah, as they are the Jews of this Ummah. Some of them are Jews who fake Islam to spread their deviance, just as Paul of the Jews faked Christianity to spread his deviance, hoping the Jews would become victorious. The Rāfidah hate Islam just as the Jews hate Christianity. They did not enter Islam longing for Allah or fearing Him, rather out of spite for the people of Islam and so as to  inflict  harm  upon  them.  Their  prayers  do  no  exceed their ears. Indeed, ‘Alī h burned them alive and banished them  to  other  lands.  Amongst  them  was  ‘Abdullāh  Ibn Saba’, a Jew from the Jews of Sanaa, who was banished to Sābāt.”\nHe r also said, “Indeed, the calamity of the Rāfidah is the same as the calamity of the Jews. The Jews say that only a person from the lineage of Dāwūd is suited for kingship. The Rāfidah say that only a person from the lineage of ‘Alī is suited for imāmah. The Jews say that there is no jihād until the Messiah comes forth and a sword descends from the heavens. The Rāfidah say there is no jihād until the Mahdī comes forth and a caller calls out from the heavens saying, ‘Follow him.’ The Jews distorted the Tawrāh. The Rāfidah did the same, distorting the Qur’ān. The Jews are not truthful when they say salām to the believers, rather they say, ‘May sām be upon you.’ And sām means death. The Rāfidah are the same. The Jews consider the wealth of all people to be halāl, as Allah described them in the Qur’ān as saying, {“There is no blame upon us concerning the illiterate [meaning the Arabs]”} [Āl ‘Imrān: 75]. The Rāfidah are the same, as they consider the wealth of all Muslims to be halāl. The Jews consider the blood of all Muslims to be halāl. The Rāfidah  are  the  same.  The  Jews  consider  the  cheating  of people to be halāl. The Rāfidah are the same. The Jews hate Jibrīl and say he is their enemy from amongst the angels. The Rāfidah are the same, as some of them claim that Jibrīl mistakenly descended with revelation upon Muhammad  and abandoned ‘Alī h.”1\nThis is a reality of which there is no doubt. The Jews and the Rāfidah are two sides of the same coin. The religion of Rafd (“Shiism”) was nothing but a plot by a Jew – Ibn Saba’ – following the footsteps of his Jewish predecessor Paul, who had corrupted the pure religion of the Messiah , leaving the Christians upon the Pauline deviance and heresies of the cross, original sin, incarnation, atonement, the lordship, divine sonhood, and godhead of the Messiah, and antinomianism (abandonment of the Law of Mūsā ).\n1   The various statements of ash-Sha’bī were reported by al-Khallāl in “As-Sunnah,”  al-Lālikā’ī  in  “Sharh  Usūl  al-I’tiqād,”  Ibn Taymiyyah  in “Minhāj  as-Sunnah,”  and  others.\nThe Rāfidah of Iran dedicate a memorial  to  dead  Iranian  Jews\n\f“ISIS poses a major threat to the U.S. and to U.S. interests abroad, and that threat is growing every day. The nature and significance of the threat flow from the fact that ISIS is – all at the same time – a terrorist group, a state and a revolutionary political movement. We have never faced an adversary like it.”\n“As a terrorist group, ISIS poses a threat to the homeland. That threat is largely indirect and involves ISIS’s ability to radicalize  young  Americans  to  conduct  attacks  here.  The FBI has over 900 open investigations into homegrown extremists, the vast majority radicalized by ISIS, and a large number  of  those  investigations  relate  to  individuals  who may be plotting here…”\n“[T]he potential exists for the quantity of … [homegrown] attacks to be large. The number of ISIS followers dwarfs the number of followers that al-Qaeda ever had. Over time, the indirect threat, if not significantly degraded, will become a direct one – that is, ISIS will have the ability to plan and direct attacks on the homeland from the group’s safe havens in Iraq and Syria, just like it did in Paris.”\n“Such attacks are deeply concerning because they carry the potential to be much more sophisticated and complex – and therefore more dangerous – than homegrown attacks, again,  just  like  in  Paris  recently,  or  London  in  2005  or even 9/11. And in news that should get everyone’s attention, ISIS has shown an interest in weapons of mass destruction.”\n“The attacks in Paris were the first manifestation of an effort by ISIS to put together an attack capability in Europe – an effort it began less than a year ago. The head of the U.K.’s domestic security agency recently warned that ISIS is now planning mass-casualty attacks in Britain. His concerns are well-founded. We will not be far behind.”\n“As a state, ISIS poses a threat to regional stability – a threat to the very territorial integrity of the current nation-states, a threat to inflame the entire region in sectarian war…”\n“As a revolutionary political movement, ISIS is gaining affiliates among extremist groups around the world. They are signing up for what ISIS desires as its objective: a global caliphate where day-to-day life is governed by extreme religious views. In the mind of ISIS, its global caliphate would extend to the U.S.”\n“When they join ISIS, these affiliates evolve from focusing on local issues to focusing on establishing an extension of the caliphate. And their targets evolve from local to international ones. This is the story of the bombing of the Russian airline by an ISIS group in the Egyptian Sinai.”\n“ISIS  has  gained  affiliates  faster  than  al-Qaeda  ever  did. From none a year ago, there are now militant groups that have sworn allegiance to ISIS in nearly 20 countries. They have conducted attacks that have killed Americans, and they carry the potential to grab large amounts of territory…”\nMorell ended his article saying:\n“Mr. President, the downing of the Russian airliner and the attacks in Paris make it crystal clear that our ISIS strategy is not working.”\nYes, the crusader strategy is not working because the Islamic State is here to stay. It is a state that inflicts just terror against its infidel, pagan, and apostate enemies. And it will continue to expand until its banner flutters over Constantinople and Rome. Until then, let the crusaders get used to the sound of explosion and the image of carnage in their very own homelands.\nSan  Bernardino  was  not  the  first, and by Allah’s permission it will not be  the  last\n\f"

He titled the piece: “I Am the Nude Warner.” Although he criticizes the factions in general, his major criticisms focused  on  “Ahrār  ash-Shām.”  Below  are  excerpts  from  his lengthy article:\n“They trick the people and say, ‘A project for the Ummah.’1 They then interpret this whenever they need as a project for Syria alone, encompassing only its land and revolutionaries … This playing on words is an attempt to beautify the  proposals  of  the  kuffār  and  apostates.  The  sammā’īn [the avid listeners to the kuffār] do this so as to offer the kuffār’s proposals through themselves as Islamic proposals. They beautify the proposals and offer them as if the proposals were their own, when the reality is they are nothing but the messengers of the apostates, and in the best case, they are parrots repeating the proposals of the hypocrites and apostates who use these sammā’īn as a part of the war against Islam … The projects of kufr would never penetrate us except through the sammā’īn, not through the ranks of apostate secularists, the atheist liberals, and their parties…”\n“I will mention some of their traits in this era … but it isn’t necessarily the case that every faction of them has all these traits:”\n“1) They beautify and propagate the principles of the kuffār including nationalism, human rights, and minority rights.  2) They flatter the apostate groups and claim that the mujāhidīn oppress them. 3) They ask that the mujāhidīn and apostates refer to them for arbitration, as if the two sides are equal. 4) They announce their acceptance of the kuffār as leaders for the lands. They cooperate with them, welcome them, and follow their orders. 5) They safeguard and sanctify the borders that the crusaders and descendants of pigs fabricated. 6) They implicitly and explicitly slander the mujāhidīn. They ally with every debased person and apostate party, granting them refuge out of fear that the hands of the mujāhidīn might reach them. 7) They accuse the peo1 Editor’s Note: This is the official slogan of the “Islamic Front” led by “Ahrār ash-Shām.”\n5151\nIN THE WORDS OF THE ENEMY\nple of īmān with extremism and lack of goodness. They give verdicts that it is prohibited to perform jihād with the mujāhidīn. 8) They describe the conceding defeatists as moderates. 9) They declare their loyalty to international law. 10) They ally with the enemies of jihād and those who obtain financial  aid  from  the  people  of  kufr  and  aggression.  11) They seek the support and aid of the kuffār and apostates. 12) They turn a blind eye towards the crimes of the apostates  and  the  kuffār,  whereas  they  dig  for  the  mistakes  of the  good  mujāhidīn.  13)  They  have  blind  eyes,  deaf  ears, and mute tongues towards the kāfir and apostate enemies, whereas they have sharp tongues against the people of īmān and jihād. 14) They throw bad labels at the mujāhidīn. They call them the other face of the Khawārij state and a party of deviance and terror, whereas they are more worthy of the description of deviance and farther from the truth and truthfulness. 15) They declare their barā’ah from Salafī Jihadism. 16)  They  describe  the  mujāhidīn  as  Khawārij,  extremists, and  corrupters.  They  wag  their  tails  in  front  of  the  apostates. 17) They call the tawāghīt ‘wulāt umūr’ [‘the people of authority’]. But this is a lie, misguidance, and falsehood. 18) They prohibit that jihād spreads to all the Muslims and interpret the Ummah to be Syria alone, the Syrian land, the Syrian country! 19) If a kāfir or tāghūt dies, they rush to offer condolences and shed tears over him. They support them in their wars that are not jihād for Allah’s sake. 20) They call the mujāhidīn ‘takfīriyyīn’ because the mujāhidīn pronounce takfīr upon the crusaders, the Jews, the zanādiqah, and the apostates. 21) They welcome cooperation with the kāfir and apostate states. 22) They follow and call for strict regionalism, as if they hold Sykes-Picot to be holy. 23) They call for a state of justice, law, and freedom, because they are embarrassed of Islam.2 24) They strive to guarantee safety for 2 Editor’s Note: He refers to a document released on 18 Rajab 1435 (“17 May 2014”) known as the “Revolutionary Pact of Honor” signed by the “Islamic Front,” “Alwiyat al-Furqān,” “Jaysh al-Mujāhidīn,” “Faylaq ashShām,” and “Al-Ittihād al-Islāmī li Ajnād ash-Shām,” and later endorsed by “Jaysh al-Yarmūk,” all allies of the Jawlānī front. When announced, \n\fAbū  Junaydah,  whose  parents  are  from  Morocco,  grew up in the crusader country of Germany. Like most youth from migrant families, he was somewhat distant from his religion despite his father and mother both then being religious Muslims. And although life in dārul-kufr led many Muslim youth to abandon the daily prayers, Abū Junaydah was an exception. No matter what he faced in life, he would never forget salāh.\nWhen  he  was  a  child,  his  father  made  him  memorize some of the Qur’ān and go with him to the masjid. When he grew older, he appreciated this discipline as due to it, he had learned much of the book of Allah.\nAnd so Allah guides whomever He wills and He showed His mercy towards Abū Junaydah, guiding him to serious practice at the age of eighteen. He began to learn his religion on his own effort and distance himself from all bad influences. He also married early to protect himself from the traps of zinā. Shortly after, Allah bestowed him with a daughter, whom he named Junaydah.\nSaddened by the events in Shām and the crimes committed against Ahlus-Sunnah, he resolved to perform hijrah there to partake in the jihād.\nIn “2013,” he travelled to Shām and joined the faction called “Junūd ash-Shām,” led by the deviant liar Muslim ash-Shīshānī. Upon arrival, Abū Junaydah was very happy to have arrived to the lands of jihād, but he quickly found out that not every “mujāhid” and not every “jihādī” faction is on the sound manhaj. He and the other mujāhidīn were forbidden from pronouncing takfīr upon the tāghūt Erdogan and the other tawāghīt of Turkey for reasons of “maslahah.” Similarly, they were forbidden from pronouncing takfīr upon the “Free Syrian Army” (FSA). He witnessed how he himself as well as the Islamic State were strongly criticized for this. There were also many situations in which the law of Allah was violated by the local factions; the people weren’t being judged by the Sharī’ah. In one of these cases, for example, a local person insulted Allah (ta’ālā) and did not receive punishment for his crime.\nWhile he was with Junūd ash-Shām, he was joined by his best friend Abū Luqmān al-Almānī and Abū Junaydah’s \n5555\nAMONGST THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN\ncousin Abū Hafs al-Almānī in order to wage jihād against the tawāghīt everywhere and their allies. But Abū Luqmān and Abū Hafs did not stay long with Junūd ash-Shām, as they  quickly  recognized  the  corrupt  and  deviant  manhaj of  the  faction  and  understood  that  they  should  join  the Jamā’ah. Thus they both gave bay’ah to Amīrul-Mu’minīn Abū Bakr al-Husaynī al-Baghdādī (hafidhahullāh), joining the Islamic State.\nOn the day of the Sahwah treachery, Abū Luqmān and Abū Hafs were captured by the FSA and imprisoned with hundreds of other muhājirīn. But they deceived their captors into releasing them. This led them to meet Abū Junaydah again, who had abandoned Junūd ash-Shām for the Jawlānī front shortly before the Sahwah. He began to work in the Jawlānī front’s media department.\nBecause of Abū Sulaymān the Australian’s lies, Abū Junaydah had some misconceptions about the Islamic State, but his heart was longing to join the Jamā’ah, to be on its side while the whole world had assembled against it militarily, politically, economically, and even in the media realm. He also began catching many contradictions in the claims of Abū  Sulaymān  the  Australian  and  his  Sahwah  comrades against the Islamic State. In addition to this, Abū Hafs – who was stuck in Halab after his release from the early Sahwah prisons – would regularly advise Abū Junaydah to join the Islamic State.\nAnd Allah guides whomever He wills. Abū Junaydah listened to the speeches of the senile and deviant Dhawāhirī and those of the former war minister of the Islamic State, Shaykh Abū Hamzah al-Muhājir r. He listened to their \n\f"

Indeed, Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful} [Al-Ahzāb:  24].”\nHe then mentions some āyāt about the Battle of Uhud in order to draw comparisons between the reason for the breakdown in the Muslim ranks during the Battle of Uhud, and the reason for the breakdown in the Muslim ranks during the course of the Mongol invasion. He says, “Allah said, {Indeed, those of you who turned back on the day the two armies met, it was Shaytān who caused them to slip because of some [blame] they had earned. But Allah has already forgiven them. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing} [Āl ‘Imrān: 155]. Allah c also said, {And Allah had certainly fulfilled His promise to you when you were killing the enemy by His permission until [the time] when you lost courage and fell to disputing about the order [given by the Prophet] and disobeyed after He had shown you that which you love. Among you are some who desire this world, and among you are some who desire the Hereafter. Then he turned you back from them [defeated] that He might test you. And He has already forgiven you, and Allah is the possessor of bounty for the believers} [Āl ‘Imrān: 152]. Allah also said, {Why [is it that] when a [single] disaster struck you [on the day of Uhud], although you had struck \n[the enemy in the battle of Badr] with one twice as great, you said, ‘From where is this?’ Say, ‘It is from yourselves.’ Indeed, Allah is over all things competent} [Āl ‘Imrān: 165]. [During the course of the battle,] the Shaytān shouted to the people, ‘Muhammad has been killed.’ So among them were those who were shaken and fled, and among them were those who stood firm and fought. So Allah said, {Muhammad is not but a messenger. [Other] messengers have passed on before him. So if he were to die or be killed, would you turn back on your heels [to unbelief]? And he who turns back on his heels will never harm Allah at all; but Allah  will  reward  the  grateful}  [Āl  ‘Imrān:  144].  And this was similar to the condition of the Muslims when they broke down last year.”\nHe then mentioned that the defeat of the Muslims in his times was due to sins, bad intentions, boasting, conceitedness, etc., and then said, “So it was out of Allah’s wisdom and His mercy upon the believers that He afflicted them with the trials He had afflicted them with, so that Allah may purify the believers and they may return to their Lord in repentance … Just as Allah’s support for the Muslims on the day of Badr was a mercy and a blessing and their defeat on the day  of  Uhud  was  a  blessing  and  a  mercy  upon  the believers, for indeed the Prophet g said, ‘Allah does not decree anything for the believer except that it is good. And this is not for anyone except the believer. If he receives good and is thankful to Allah, it is good for him, and if he is afflicted with hardship and is patient, it is good for him.’”\nShaykhul-Islām’s words above are just as applicable to the Ummah today.

He met a man in prison who was  originally  Muslim  but  hated  the  religion and everything related to the religion, to the point  that  this  man  prevented  his  wife  from wearing  hijāb  and  would  prevent  his  brother back  home  from  learning  Arabic.  In  prison, this man met the brother Abū Basīr and stayed with him for 2-3 months. After this period, he would pray all the prayers during their proper time, pray qiyāmul-layl every night, and recite the Qu’rān daily. He ordered his wife to wear hijāb and ordered her to sell the house that he had  purchased  with  a  usurious  loan  so  as  to get out of harām. This story is a story from the dozens  of  unexaggerated  stories.  Those  who met the brother Abū Basīr will weep over his shahādah.

He would recite Qur’ān much. The  best  dhikr  is  the  recitation  of  His  words (subhānah)  –  the  words  He  revealed  to  His Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam),  as  in the  hadīth,  “You  do  not  return  to  Allah  with something  better  than  what  left  from  Him” [Sahīh: Reported by al-Hākim].\nHIS FOLLOWING OF THE EVIDENCE\n{Follow, [O mankind], what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other than Him any allies.

We  spent  months  trying  to  find  a way into Europe, and by Allah’s strength, we succeeded in finally making our way to Belgium. We were then able to obtain weapons and set up a safe house while we planned to carry out opera-\ntions against the crusaders. All of this was facilitated for us by Allah. There is no might nor power except by Him.\nDĀBIQ: How did the kāfir media get a hold of your picture as a soldier in jihād? \nABŪ ‘UMAR: A  brother  had  taken  video  footage of some of us before a battle, but his camera got lost and was later sold by a murtadd to a Western journalist.

        "@value": "nor is she to dye her hair or apply kohl” [Reported by Abū Dāwūd and an-Nasā’ī from Umm Salamah].\nA woman came to the Messenger of Allah  and said, “O Messenger  of  Allah,  my  daughter’s  husband  passed  away and she complains of pain in her eye. Should I apply kohl to her?” The Messenger of Allah  said, “No,” two or three times  [Reported  by  al-Bukhārī  and  Muslim  from  Umm Salamah].\nIbn ‘Abbās  said, “He would forbid the one whose husband  passed  away  from  using  perfume  and  adornment” [Musannaf  Ibn  Abī  Shaybah].\nAs for the use of dyes in clothing, then those “that are not intended for adornment – like the color black or what is dyed  to  make  something  look  less  appealing  or  to  cover up  blemishes  –  are  not  prohibited”  [Zād  al-Ma’ād  –  Ibnul-Qayyim]. Ibnul-Mundhir r (died 319AH) also said that both Mālik and ash-Shāfi’ī considered it permissible for the mourning widow to wear black “because it is not an adornment and it is the clothing of grief” [Naylul-Awtār – Ash-Shawkānī]. And Allah knows best.\nAdditionally,  the  mourning  widow  must  complete  her ‘iddah in the house in which she lived when her husband died, whether it is his property or a rental. The sister of Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī  went to the Messenger of Allah  to ask him for permission to return to her family from Banī Khudrah, explaining that her husband went out searching for some runaway slaves, but was killed by them when he found them. She said, “I asked Allah’s Messenger  that I return to my family, as my husband left me no home and no spending money.” The Messenger of Allah  approved, but when she left, he called for her and said, “What did you ask?” She repeated the story about her husband to him. He said, “Stay in your house in which you received the news of your husband’s death until the appointed time is reached.” She said, “So I counted my ‘iddah therein for four months and ten days.” She continued, “Then when ‘Uthmān asked me about that [during his khilāfah], I informed him of the matter. So he adhered to it and ruled accordingly” [Reported in the four Sunan and declared sahīh by at-Tirmidhī, Ibn Hibbān, and al-Hākim].\nAt-Tirmidhī r said, “This hadīth is hasan sahīh and most of the scholars from the Sahābah and others acted thereon. They did not allow the woman in her ‘iddah to move from her husband’s house until her ‘iddah ended. This is the opinion of Sufyān ath-Thawrī, ash-Shāfi’ī, Ahmad, and Ishāq.”\nSo this hadīth proves that the mourning widow must stay in the home in which she resided with her husband. This is the opinion of most scholars. ‘Uthmān Ibn ‘Affān – the Rightly-Guided Khalīfah – also ruled according to this in \nthe presence of the Muhājirīn and the Ansār. It was also the opinion of the second Rightly-Guided Khalīfah ‘Umar and his son, as well as Ibn Mas’ūd and others from the Sahābah, may Allah be pleased with all of them.\nAs such, it is harām for the mourning widow to move from her home to another except with a lawful excuse, as was explained by Ibn Qudāmah, who said, “If she fears demolition of the house, drowning therein, an approaching enemy, or something along these lines, or the owner of the house wishes to move her elsewhere, such as him lending the house then changing his mind, or its lease has ended, or he wrongfully expels her from the house or refuses to renew the lease, or he demands more than its going price, or she cannot afford it except from her own wealth, then she is allowed to move, as such situations are excusable and she is not required to pay for housing [from her own wealth], but her only obligation is that of residing there, not in obtaining the place itself. If she is unable to reside there [for reasons mentioned earlier], the obligation falls” [Al-Mughnī].\nAnd while the mourning widow spends her ‘iddah residing at her husband’s home, if she has any needs to attend to, then she can do so during the day, as night is a time that causes suspicions to arise. But, if she can find someone to run errands and take care of other needs for her, then the best place for her is her home. When she does go out for a need, she has to be back by maghrib (sunset). Lastly, she can’t sleep anywhere except at her home.\nIbn ‘Umar  said, “It is not right that she should spend a single night, during the ‘iddah of either death or divorce, except in her home” [Musannaf ‘Abdir-Razzāq].\nAnd while Ibn ‘Umar’s daughter  was in her ‘iddah after the passing away of her husband, she would visit her family during the day and speak with them; but as night fell, he would order her to return to her house [Musannaf ‘Abdir-Razzāq].\nLikewise, some women from Hamdān who were informed of their husbands passing away told Ibn Mas’ūd h, “We are feeling very lonely.” So he said to them, “Gather with one another during the day, then each woman should return to her home at night” [Musannaf ‘Abdir-Razzāq]. Of course, such gatherings should not become the norm, in adherence to the āyah, {And abide in your houses} [Al-Ahzāb: 33]. These gatherings should also be free of gossip, backbiting, and other sins. And the mourning widow must observe the rulings of ihdād therein. These occasional gatherings ought to serve a purpose such as worship, learning the religion, or keeping family ties.\nThus,  the  mourning  widow  should  remember  that  the Muslimāt – widows or not – do not leave their homes ex-\n\fevery  individual  from  your  Ummah  is,  {So  fight  in  the cause  of  Allah;  you  are  not  held  responsible  except  for yourself}.’ And for this reason, it is incumbent on every believer to wage jihād, even if he has to do so alone. And in that regard is the statement of the Prophet , ‘By Allah, I will surely fight them even if I’m alone’ [Reported by al-Bukhārī from al-Miswar and Marwān], and also the statement of Abū Bakr when the apostasy occurred, ‘And if my right hand were to oppose me, I would wage jihād against it with my left hand.’’”\nThis statement of al-Qurtubī, along with those of other mufassirīn, highlights the magnitude of what the believers have been burdened with. The matter of believing in Allah and then striving to raise high His kalimah – lā ilāha illallāh – is so significant that if one had no choice but to march forth and fight by himself to achieve this, he would have to do so. As such, Allah  reminds His Messenger  and the believers that each individual is only responsible for himself. He should not look around and base his decision to make hijrah and wage jihād for the cause of Allah on what other people are doing. Nor should he hesitate to strike the enemies of Allah  if it’s within his means to do so, even if he were alone.\nOn the statement of Allah, {You are not held responsible except for yourself}, Ibn Kathīr mentions a report from Ibn Abī Hātim that al-Barā’ Ibn ‘Āzib h was asked if a man who encountered a hundred of the enemy and fought them was considered to be from those about whom Allah said, {And do not throw yourselves with your own hands into destruction} [Al-Baqarah: 195]. He replied, “Allah  said to His Prophet, {So fight in the cause of Allah; you are not held responsible except for yourself. And encourage the believers [to fight]}.”\nThus, the believer should be prepared to fight alone when necessary  and  to  incite  others  to  join  him  in  jihād.  He should  not  be  discouraged  by  a  lack  of  numbers  and should  understand  that  the  rewards  of  a  good  deed  are multiplied  when  one  faces  greater  difficulty  in  carrying them out, as is the case when one finds no one to support him in fighting the kuffār, yet courageously marches forward and terrorizes the enemies of Allah nonetheless.\nIn his tafsīr of the aforementioned āyah, al-Qurtubī then explains the statement of Allah {That perhaps Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve}, saying, “Allah restrained the might of the mushrikīn at Badr as-Sughrā (the  Minor  Badr)  and  they  went  back  on  what  they promised the Prophet  of war and fighting1  … Allah 1   The Minor Badr refers to an appointment for battle between the Prophet  and the mushrikīn of Quraysh two years after the decisive battle of Badr. The Prophet  and his companions camped at Badr for eight days waiting for the enemy to arrive. The mushrikīn halted their march towards Badr when they reached the area of Marr adh-Dhahrān, \n{And Allah is greater in might and stronger in punishment} [An-Nisā’: 84]\nalso sufficed the believers at al-Hudaybiyah of what the mushrikīn sought to carry out of treachery and opportunism. Thus, the believers sensed their plot and headed out, capturing them as prisoners, and this occurred as the envoys were going between them to negotiate a truce.2 This is  what  is  intended  by  His    statement,  {And  it  is  He who withheld their hands from you} [Al-Fath: 24] … And Allah  cast  terror  into  the  hearts  of  the  factions  [during al-Khandaq]  and  they  departed  without  any  killing  or fighting, as He   said, {And Allah spared the believers from having to fight}. Likewise, the Jews left their homes and their wealth [near al-Madīnah] without the Muslims battling  them.  So  all  this  is  might  that  Allah  restrained from afflicting the believers, in addition to a large number of Jews and Christians leaving off war and entering into the jizyah agreement in humiliation and submissively. Thus, Allah restrained their might from the believers.”\nThese words altogether carry a monumental lesson for the \nand decided to forego the battle and return to Makkah due to their fear.2   This refers to an incident that took place when the Prophet  was encamped  outside  Makkah  as  the  treaty  of  Hudaybiyah  was  being negotiated with Quraysh. The more zealous youth of Quraysh saw that their leaders wanted a treaty with the Prophet , so they sought to devise a plan that would ruin the negotiations. They decided to head out at night and stealthily move towards the Muslim encampment where they would take action and attempt to ignite a war. Around seventy or eighty of them went out and descended from Mount at-Tan’īm, attempting to sneak towards the Muslim camp, but were all captured by Muhammad Ibn Maslamah, the commander of the Muslim guard. The Prophet  later freed them all to ensure the successful negotiation of the treaty. In this regard, Allah  revealed the āyah, {And it is He who withheld their hands from you and your hands from them within the area of Makkah after He caused you to overcome them} [Al-Fath: 24].\n\f"

Jihād was legislated to make the people enter the religion, not to make them turn away from the religion or to distort its image.”1\nThis  type  of  rhetoric  is  typical  of  hizbiyyīn  – even  those  masquerading  as  supporters  of the  mujāhidīn  –  who  continue  to  live  under the  authority  of  the  murtadd  puppets,  and of  defeatist  Muslims  who  reside  in  the  lands of  kufr  under  the  authority  of  the  crusaders themselves, with no intention of making hijrah to those lands in which the word of Allah is the highest.  Such  people  have  had  their  religion diluted and, not surprisingly, are always amongst the  first  to  speak  out  in  any  case  where  the \n6 ARTICLE\nTHE LIAR ABŪ SAYYĀF\nmujāhidīn display their harshness towards the crusaders, attempting to disguise their criticism towards the mujāhidīn as concern for the image of Islam.\nIn burning the crusader pilot alive and burying him  under  a  pile  of  debris,  the  Islamic  State carried  out  a  just  form  of  retaliation  for  his involvement in the crusader bombing campaign which  continues  to  result  in  the  killing  of countless  Muslims  who,  as  a  result  of  these airstrikes,  are  burned  alive  and  buried  under mountains of debris. This is not to even mention _____________1   Abū Sayyāf ash-Shalabī exposed the full extent of his evil when displaying his remorse for the murtadd pilot in the face of the mujāhidīn. He also fabricated stories about the negotiations regarding the prisoners by claiming to be involved in these negotiations, whereas the representative of the Jordanian tāghūt from the beginning was ‘Āsim Tāhir al-Barqāwī (AKA Abū Muhammad al-Maqdisī,  whose  campaign  of  lies  carries  on).  Furthermore,  ash-Shalabī shamelessly lied by claiming that the murtadd Baathist ‘Izzat ad-Dūrī and other murtadd Baathists were members of the Islamic State and involved in the negotiations! So, a shameless liar – ash-Shalabī – is taken as a “jihādī mentor”! One can only say to him, “If you have no shame, then do as you wish” [Sahīh al-Bukhārī].\n\fADVICE FOR THE LEADERS OF THE ISLAMIC STATE\nPraise be to Allah, and may blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah, and upon his family and those who support him. As for what follows…\nMy dear mujāhid brother, these are some pieces of advice that I’ve gathered from the mouths of men and the pages of books, although I do not claim to be a man of wisdom. I ask Allah to make you and me benefit from these pieces of advice. And Allah knows all intentions. [1]  Have  sincerity  towards  Allah,  for  it  will lead  to  salvation  in  the  worldly  life  and  the Hereafter. Allah’s Messenger (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “Allah has guaranteed the one who  performs  jihād  for  His  cause,  having  left his home for no reason other than to perform jihād for His cause and to affirm the truth of His words, that He would enter him into Jannah or return him back home with all the rewards he has attained or the ghanīmah he has acquired.”\nLet  the  goal  of  your  deed  be  that  the  word of  Allah  becomes  the  highest,  for  Abū  Mūsa said,  “Allah’s  Messenger  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa sallam) was asked about a man who fights out of bravery, out of zeal, or out of riyā’ (showing off), which of these is fighting for Allah’s cause? So  Allah’s  Messenger  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa sallam) said, ‘Whoever fights so that the word of  Allah  is  the  highest  is  fighting  for  Allah’s cause.’” [2] Be just and sincere towards your subjects, for  “No  man  is  appointed  to  lead  ten  people except that he will be brought forth in shackles on the Day of Judgment, and will either be set free on account of his justice or destroyed as a result of his oppression.” Likewise, “Any leader who takes charge of the affairs of the Muslims and  then  doesn’t  strive  for  them  and  advise them,  will  not  enter  Jannah  with  them.”  And likewise, “Allah does not give one of His slaves leadership,  who  then  dies  having  cheated  his subjects,  except  that  Allah  will  make  Jannah prohibited for him.”\n10 ARTICLE10 ARTICLE\n[3] Seek consultation and hold discussions, for discussion is the partner of consultation. One should sit in a gathering to exchange ideas, then each  person  comments  on  the  opinions  put forth by the others, or puts forth a new opinion, and  at  the  end  of  the  gathering  the  correct opinion  will  become  clear.  Allah  (ta’ālā)  said, {And consult them concerning the matter} [Āl ‘Imrān: 159]. Allah has directed His Prophet to consult those under him despite the Prophet’s prudent intellect. So what about you?\nAnd  as  was  reported,  “One  who  seeks consultation will have no regret, and one who prays  istikhārah  will  not  go  wrong.”  And  it’s been  said,  “He  who  relies  exclusively  on  his intellect will go astray, and he who is content with his own opinion will slip up, and he who consults  intelligent  men  will  take  the  correct path, and he who seeks the help of a man with insight will attain what is hoped for.”\nSo  let  every  leader  have  a  true  consultative council beginning with the general leader and ending with the detachment commanders. But do not consult a person who has a certain need that he is seeking to fulfill, nor a person whom you sense desires to be consulted, nor a person who doesn’t think his opinions through, for it’s been said, “Leave your opinion until it ripens.” It was reported that ‘Alī said, “The opinion of an elder is better than the view of a young man,” meaning  with  regards  to  battle.  And  don’t consult  anyone  unless  he’s  alone,  meaning that you should consult him in private, for this ensures more secrecy and is a greater deterrent to  anyone  who  might  otherwise  disclose  the issue.\nIt is true! “Consultation and discussion are two doors to mercy, and two keys to blessings. No opinion  that’s  been  reached  with  the  help  of these two things will go wrong.”\n[4]  Beware  of  only  consulting  a  person  who always  agrees  with  your  opinion,  and  beware of  bad  company.  Get  accustomed  to  being \n\f"

This  is  from  the  mutual “pragmatism” between the American administration  and the  Sahwah Coalition  containing  the  Jawlānī front. “Do not rule by the Sharī’ah so that  we  strike  your  enemies.”  “Halt operations  against  the  crusaders  or else we will bombard you.” It is the politics of the carrot and stick.\ntheir  brothers \nThis  might  be  the  beginning  of  the implementation of proposals made by crusader think tanks, some of which were quoted in the last issue of Dābiq, in the section titled “In the Words of the Enemy.” The matter might have depended  on  the  crusaders’  killing of leaders  in  al-Qā’idah  so  that the  organization  submits  fearfully alongside the Tālibān emirate to American politics. Now just as the Tālibān do not pose a threat towards the safety and security of the crusader homeland, al-Qā’idah no longer poses a threat. This became the case after Dhawāhirī adopted new policies opposing the policies of the mujāhid Shaykh Usāmah Ibn Lādin r. So Dhawāhirī made the crusader lands secure, the tawāghīt secure, the post-“Arab  Spring”  tawāghīt  secure, the  Ikhwānī  tawāghīt  secure,  the \nin \narmies  of  apostasy  secure,  and  the Rāfidī mobs and savages secure [As in the Jawlānī interview with AlJazeera and  as  in  “General  Guidelines  for Jihādī Action” by Dhawāhirī].\nthe \nRather  the  matter  surpassed  even this  to  the  point  that  the  “clearcut  maslahah  (interest)”  was in abandoning implementation of  the  Sharī’ah  and  its  laws!  A “pragmatic” policy, or so the crusaders claim. The New York Times also said on “9 June 2015” in an article titled “Al Qaeda Tries a New Tactic to Keep Power: Sharing It,” “After they routed the army in southern Yemen, fighters from Al Qaeda stormed into the city of  Al  Mukalla,  seizing  government buildings,  releasing  jihadists  from prison  and stealing  millions  of dollars from the central bank. Then they surprised  everyone.  Instead of  raising  their  flags  and  imposing Islamic law, they passed control to a civilian council and gave it a budget to pay salaries, import fuel and hire teams  to  clean  up  garbage.  The fighters receded into the background, maintaining  only  a  single  police station to arbitrate disputes…”\n“[The]  branches  [of  Al  Qaeda]  in \nYemen and Syria are now increasingly making  common  cause  with  local groups on the battlefield…” \n“Al  Qaeda’s  branches  in  Syria  and Yemen  have  taken  a  different  route [from  the  Islamic  State],  building ties with local groups and refraining from the strict application of Shariah, the  legal  code  of  Islam,  when  faced with  local  resistance,  according  to residents  of  areas  where  Al  Qaeda holds  sway.  When  Al  Qaeda  took over  Al  Mukalla  in  April,  it  seized government  buildings  and  used trucks  to  cart  off  more  than  $120 million from the central bank … But it  soon  passed  control  to  a  civilian council,  giving  it  a  budget  of  more than  $4  million  to  provide  services, an  arrangement  that  made  sense  to local  officials  seeking  to  serve  their people during wartime. ‘We are not Qaeda stooges,’ said Abdul-Hakeem bin Mahfood, the council’s secretary general,  in  a  telephone  interview. ‘We formed the council to avoid the destruction  of  the  city.’  While  the council  pays  salaries  and  distributes fuel,  Al  Qaeda  maintains  a  police station  to  settle  disputes,  residents said. It has so far made no effort to ban smoking or regulate how women \ndabiq\n\fInterview with Abū Samīr al-Urdunī\nDābiq: What information do you have about the Sahwah plot and the role of the Jawlānī front in it?\nAbū Samīr: Jawlānī visited me in the last days of December  2013  and  informed  me  that  he  had been  in  a  meeting  with  the  “Islamic  Front”  and its  battalions  including  “Liwā’  at-Tawhīd”  and also  some  of  the  battalions  that  belong  to  the Free Syrian Army. He informed me that they had decided  to  fight  the  Islamic  State.  I  said  to  him, “Why were you invited to this meeting?” He said, “For the issue to be proposed and discussed with me, because I am one of the sides in the arena and close to the Islamic State.” I said to him, “What was your response?” He said, “I told them I would cover the fronts against the regime.” I said, “Then that is your role!” He said to me, “How can you say I have a role to play?” So I said to him, “You are going to cover  some  of  the  battlefronts  that  these  factions now hold in order for them to withdraw and then gather in larger numbers against the Islamic State.” This  is  really  what  happened  afterwards  and  that was approximately 10 days after this meeting with Jawlānī on 3 January 2014.1\nIn  fact,  I  even  heard  Ahmad  Zakkūr,  one  of  the leaders  of  “Jabhat  an-Nusrah,”  calling  Jawlānī  on the  walkie-talkie  when  he  had  disappeared  from sight  after  the  fighting  between  the  Islamic  State and  the  factions  including  the  Free  Syrian  Army had begun. Zakkūr said to him, “We have to help our brothers from the factions present in the arena and  stop  the  oppression  of  the  Islamic  State  and fight against it.”\nThis is in addition to other events I myself witnessed. When  for  example,  some  of  the  leadership  of “Jabhat  an-Nusrah”  supported  the  Free  Syrian Army with weapons and helped them in fighting against  the  Islamic  State  in  some  regions,  as  was the case of Hammawdah and Abū Dharr at-Tūnusī in the western part of Halab. [Hammawdah is the Jawlānī front’s top leader of that region].\n1 Editor’s Note: Jawlānī had foreknowledge of the plot and kept it hidden from the Islamic State. Rather he took part in the planning and execution of the plot, a plot which almost destroyed the mission of jihād in Shām and by which the pure blood of the muhājirīn and ansār was poured. Then some dare to claim that his front did not partake in the Sahwah!\nThe  same  thing  in  Idlib,  in  that  Abū  Sulaymān the  Australian  prevented  the  soldiers  of  “Jabhat an-Nusrah”  from  helping  the  Islamic  State  when the Free Syrian Army planned to attack the State’s training  camp  there  while  it  was  possible  for them to help the Islamic State. So I sent for Abū Sulaymān the Australian and said to him, “You are able to place detachments to prevent the Free Syrian Army’s advance towards the training camp.” I was surprised the next day that the Free Syrian Army had entered the training camp after surrounding it and cutting off reinforcement lines, and had fought the  soldiers  of  the  Islamic  State  inside.  This  was the  beginning  of  my  suspicion  that  there  was  an internal  plot  between  the  Free  Syrian  Army  and “Jabhat an-Nusrah.”\nDābiq: When did you decide to distance yourself from the events that were occurring?\nAbū Samīr: After my examination and following of the events, I felt that there was a plot being carried out against the Islamic State with the participation of “Jabhat an-Nusrah.” So I decided to keep myself distant  and  move  to  the  south.  On  my  way,  I gathered much evidence for this conclusion. From it is that I met Abū ‘Abbās ad-Darīr, who was the leader of “Jabhat an-Nusrah” for the region of arRaqqah. I met him in the area of Albūkamāl and asked  him  about  the  reason  for  his  fighting  the Islamic State in ar-Raqqah. He mentioned to me the whole story of how he and Ahrār ash-Shām had agreed with many of the battalions including those of Abū ‘Īsā ar-Raqqah (Liwā’ Thuwwār ar-Raqqah) \nAbū Sulaymān the Australian,an ally of the FSA\ndabiq\n\f"

These operations are merely a selection of the numerous operations that the Islamic State has conducted on various fronts across many regions over the course of the last two months.\nWilāyat  al-Khayr  -  On  Wednesday  the  25th  of  DhulQa’dah, the soldiers of the Khilāfah carried out an assault on  the  forward  defense  position  for  the  missile  battalion base  at  the  Dayr  az-Zawr  military  airbase  and  succeeded in taking control of the position. Two istishhādī operations were  then  carried  out  by  our  brothers  Abū  Ayman  ashShāmī and Abul-Khansā’ al-Himsī using a tank and a BMP rigged with explosives. They targeted two groups of Nusayrī soldiers inside the battalion base, and their attacks were followed by an assault in which the mujāhidīn succeeded in taking complete control of the base and capturing a large quantity  of  ghanīmah.  One  month  later,  the  mujāhidīn would score another major victory in their ongoing efforts to capture the Dayr az-Zawr airbase. In a string of blessed operations, the soldiers of the Khilāfah, by Allah’s grace, succeeded in capturing a number of strategic points in the \nAchieved  shahadah  during the operation that led to the capture of the missile battalion base in al-Khayr\nA Nusayrī soldier shortly before he’s killed\n25\nA SELECTION OF MILITARY OPERATIONS\nvicinity  of  the  airbase,  including  the  Abul-Walīd  farms, Buyūt ad-Dughaym, Dashmat Hamad, and the Zanūbiyā factory next to the entrance to the airbase. This occurred after several days of continuous clashes during the course of which several istishhādī operations were carried out. The soldiers of the Khilāfah continue to besiege the airbase, anticipating its pending liberation, bi idhnillāh.\nWilāyat al-Barakah - On Wednesday the 1st of Dhul-Hijjah, our brother Abū ‘Amr al-Barakah succeeded in breaching PKK security checkpoints in the city of al-Barakah and attacked the murtaddīn’s public relations headquarters located on the outskirts of the Mushayrifah neighborhood. He detonated his explosive vehicle, destroying the headquarters,  killing  nearly  30  murtaddīn,  and  wounding  several others. May Allah accept him amongst the shuhadā’.\nBengal - On Monday the 14th of Dhul-Hijjah, a security cell comprised of the Khilāfah’s soldiers in Bangladesh targeted and killed the Italian crusader Cesare Tavella, following him on one of the streets of the city of Dhaka and shooting him with a silencer. Just five days later, they struck again, targeting Kunio Hoshi, a citizen of Japan, one of the member nations  of  the  crusader  coalition.  He  was  closely  tracked and eliminated in the city of Rangpur using a firearm. Just three weeks later, on the 10th of Muharram, the mujāhidīn detonated a number of IEDs on the Dālān temple in the city of Dhaka as the Rāfidah were conducting their shirkī rituals, killing and wounding nearly 100 of them. Eleven days later, the mujāhidīn assaulted a checkpoint in Dhaka, killing one policeman and wounding another.\nWilāyat  ‘Adan  Abyan  -  On  Tuesday  the  22nd  of  DhulHijjah,  four  istishhādī  operations  targeted  a  gathering  of Saudi, Emirati, and Yemeni officers and pounded the Yemeni government’s headquarters. The first was carried out by our brother Abū Sa’d al-‘Adanī, who detonated his explosive truck at the Palace Hotel, which served as the government’s headquarters.  He  was  followed  by  the  second  istishhādī, Abū  Muhammad  as-Sahlī,  who  detonated  his  explosive Hummer at the same location, killing the murtadd soldiers present there. The third istishhādī attack was carried out by our brother Aws al-‘Adanī targeting the Saudi and Emirati forces’ central operations base. He detonated his explosive \n\f"

Shaykh ‘Abdul-Karīm al-Humayd (may Allah keep him  firm  and  release  him  from  imprisonment) wrote  an  excellent  treatise  titled  “Al-Mashāyikh al-Judud  wa  Da’watuhum  ilal  Mubāhalah”  (The New Mashāyikh and Calling Them to Mubāhalah) in which he clarified the proofs for the matter and called the so-called “Committee of Elder Scholars” as well as Salmān al-‘Awdah and Nāsir al-‘Umar to a mubāhalah, after they repeatedly labelled the mujāhidīn “khawārij” and invited the Palestinians to participate in the shirkī religion of democracy by voting for Hamas! The following discussion on mubāhalah is mostly taken from his treatise.\nThe main proof for the legality of mubāhalah is the verses: {Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created Him from dust; then He said to him, “Be,” and he was. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters. Then whoever argues with you about it after knowledge has come to you – say, “Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women,  ourselves  and  yourselves,  then  supplicate earnestly and invoke the curse of Allah upon the liars”} [Āl ‘Imrān: 59-61].\nThese  verses  were  revealed  with  regards  to  a christian  delegation  from  Najrān  that  came  to the Prophet (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and debated him on Islam. When mubāhalah was proposed, the christian delegation backed out.\nAllah ‘azza wa jall also said, {Say, “Whoever is in error – let ar-Rahmān lengthen for him an extension [in time] until, when they see that which they were promised – either punishment or the Hour.” They will come to know who is worst in position \nand weaker in soldiers”} [Maryam: 75].\nIbn  Kathīr  (rahimahullāh)  said  –  commenting  on the verse, “Allah ta’ālā says, {Say}, O Muhammad to these mushrikīn who associate others with their Lord, who claim that they are upon the  truth and that you are upon falsehood. \n{Whoever is in error}, meaning from amongst us and amongst you. {Let ar-Rahmān lengthen for him an extension} meaning, that Allah leaves him in his condition,  until  he  meets  his  Lord  and  his  term elapses.  {Either  punishment}  afflicts  him,  {or  the Hour} comes to him suddenly. {They will come to know} then, {who is worst in position and weaker in soldiers}, meaning in contrast to their claim of good position and assembly.”\n“Mujāhid said regarding His words: {Let ar-Rahmān lengthen  for  him  an  extension},  ‘Let  Allah  leave him in his tyranny.’ This is what Abu Ja’far Ibn Jarīr at-Tabarī (rahimahullāh) ascertained.”\n“This  is  the  mubāhalah  for  the  mushrikīn  who claim  that  they  are  upon  guidance  with  regards to  their  religion,  as  Allah  ta’ālā  also  mentioned the mubāhalah for the jews in His words,  {Say, “O you who are jews, if you claim that you are allies of Allah, excluding the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful”} [Al-Jumu’ah: 6], meaning supplicate for death to befall the one upon falsehood amongst us or amongst you; if you claim that you are upon truth, then du’ā’ cannot harm you. But they retreated from this invitation” [Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr].\nIbn ‘Abbās, Ibn Mas’ūd, ash-Sha’bī, al-Awzā’ī, Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibnul-Qayyim, Ibn Hajar,  Muhammad  Ibn  ‘Abdil-Wahhāb,  and \ndabiq\fthe enemy’s WorDs\n“\nI come to the floor this morning with great  sorrow  and  great  concern  and even deep alarm about the events that are transpiring rapidly in Iraq.

This threat was received with typical American indifference.  \n7) Upon receiving the threat and prior to  the  execution,  Obama  scurried  to prevent knowledge of the affair from reaching his citizenry. His administration immediately ordered a number of online  social  networks  to  shut  down all  Islamic  State  media  accounts,  including accounts of Islamic State supporters.\n8) In his speech on “August 20, 2014,” Obama  completely  avoided  mention of  Steven  Sotloff,  again  showing  his “people”  that the number one interest of the American government is the sanctity of Israel and its allies, which include the Zionist Peshmerga forces. These  are  more  important  than  the lives of his citizenry.\nAnd  with  Allah’s  permission,  Obama will  continue  to  follow  in  the  footsteps of his predecessor, Bush, only to become the worst heir for the worst testator,  and  ultimately  bring  about the complete collapse of the modern American empire.\nAnd all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all creation.\nJames WrigHtfoLey\n\farticLe\nthe soldiers and the commanders to be of different colors, languages, and lands: the Najdī, the Jordanian, the Tunisian, the Egyptian, the Somali, the Turk, the Albanian, the Chechen, the Indonesian, the Russian, the European, the American and so on. They left their families and their lands to renew the state of the muwahhidīn in Shām, and they had never known each other until they arrived in Shām! I have no doubt that this state, which  has  gathered  the  bulk  of  the  muhājirīn in Shām and has become the largest collection of muhājirīn in the world, is a marvel of history that  has  only  come  about  to  pave  the  way  for al-Malhamah  al-Kubrā  (the  grand  battle  prior to the Hour). And Allah knows best. The Islamic State has become a reality that everyone can \nsee. Even the apostates cannot ignore its threat, let  alone  the  cross  worshippers  and  the  Jews. Yet those who are falsely associated with jihād turn away from the Islamic State, even publicly declaring their enmity against it in bizarre competition  with  the  crusaders  and  the  apostates. Subhānallāh, what great importance the Islamic State has! And what a tremendous favor it is from Allah to guide one to the Islamic State and grant  him  companionship  with  its  muhājirīn, those  who  plunge  into  the  malāhim  (the  great battles prior to the Hour)! For a man is upon the religion of his close friends, and he does not love a  people  except  that  he  will  be  gathered  with them  on  the  Day  of  Resurrection,  whether  he likes it or not.\nparT 2:\ntHose WHo Break offfrom tHeir triBes\nIbn Mas’ūd (radiyallāhu ‘anh) said that the Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  said,  “Verily  Islam began  as  something  strange,  and  it  will  return  to being  something  strange  as  it  first  began,  so  glad tidings to the strangers.” Someone asked, “Who are the strangers?” He said, “Those who break off from their tribes” [reported by Imām Ahmad, ad-Dārimī, and Ibn Mājah, with a sahīh isnād].\nImām  Abū  Mus’ab  az-Zarqāwī  said,  “Allah  has  described these strangers with a number of characteristics, among them being that they are nuzzā’ of the people, or nuzzā’ from the tribes. The word nuzzā’ is the plural of nazī’ and nāzi’, which refers to a stranger who breaks off from his family and tribe [meaning  he  departs  and  distances  himself  from  them], and the nazā’i’ of the camels are the outsiders. AlHarawī (rahimahullāh) said, ‘By this he [the Prophet] is referring to the muhājirīn who’ve abandoned their homelands and migrated to Allah ta’ālā’” [al-Qābidūna ‘alal-Jamr].\n\f"

        "@value": "The Ruling on Riddah\nThe ruling of the person who commits riddah is \nthat he is killed, unless he repents before he is apprehended. Allah’s Messenger g sent Mu’ādh Ibn Jabal h to Yemen to assist Abū Mūsā al-Ash’arī h with ruling the people according to the Sharī’ah. When he arrived at the court assembly, he found there a man bound in chains. He asked Abū Mūsā, “Who is this?” He replied, “He was a Jew who accepted Islam and then became a Jew again. Sit.” Mu’ādh said, “I will not sit until he is killed. Such is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger! Such is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger! Such is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger!” So Abū Mūsā gave the order and he was killed [Reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]. His repeated statement, that “such is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger,” is a clear evidence that the ruling of one who leaves Islam after he is apprehended is that he is killed.\nAs for repenting before being caught, then Allah said, {Say, “O My slaves, those who have transgressed against  themselves,  do  not  despair  of  the  mercy  of Allah. Verily, Allah forgives all sins. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. And repent to your Lord and surrender to Him before the punishment reaches you; then  you  will  not  be  helped”}  [Az-Zumar:  53-54]. Likewise,  and  specifically  about  the  apostate,  Allah \nThe punishment for apostasy\nsaid, {How would Allah guide a people who disbelieved  after  they  believed,  having  testified  that  the Messenger is true, and clear evidences reached them, and  Allah  does  not  guide  tyrannical  people.  Those, their reward is that the curse of Allah, the angels, and all of mankind is upon them, abiding therein forever. The torment does not lessen for them, nor are they given respite, except those who repent thereafter and correct themselves, for verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful} [Āl ‘Imrān: 87-89]. It should then be no surprise  that  Amīrul-Mu’minīn  Abū  Bakr  al-Baghdādī (hafidhahullāh)  declared  that  any  of  the  apostates from the sahwāt or otherwise who repent to Allah and surrender themselves to the Islamic State will be guaranteed amnesty, even if they had killed a million mujāhidīn. But those who are caught before they repent, then there is no amnesty for them and theirs shall be a painful – and fatal – punishment.\nHistorical Examples\nDuring  the  life  and  mission  of  the  Prophet  g, \nthe issue of riddah arose on a few occasions. The most famous case was that of the ‘Uklī–‘Uranī apostates. Some men from the tribes of ‘Ukl and ‘Uraynah came to al-Madīnah, entered upon the Prophet g, and announced their Islam. They then said to him, “O  Prophet  of  Allah! We  are  a  people  of  livestock, \n\fthe pro-democracy “Islamist” parties who refer legislation to several dozen or  several  hundred  elected  officials (“legislators”) and between the pagan Hindus who direct worship to countless idols. Yet, out of Allah’s mercy, He did  not  impose  upon  our  Ummah such a difficult act of atonement for shirk  as  He  did  for  Banī  Isrā’īl,  but instead only requires that those who fall into shirk abandon the act of shirk they committed and repent sincerely.Furthermore, by stating that only a  few  of  the  hypocrites  would  obey Him if He were to command them to kill themselves or to perform hijrah, Allah  is  exposing  the  nature  of  the hypocrites who merely pay lip service to the religion without actually having obedience to their Lord. As such, if  they  were  to  be  faced  with  commands that entail a tremendous level of difficulty and sacrifice, they would make  excuses  for  themselves  rather than follow the clear revelation. This reinforces the point that the true slave of Allah is one who neither questions the  wisdom  in  His  commands  nor hesitates to carry them out, regardless of how difficult they may appear. It’s important to note that many of those who  claim  to  follow  Allah  and  His Messenger find it difficult to perform deeds – whether hijrah or otherwise –  purely  out  of  obedience  to  Allah and His Messenger. They claim that they must know the wisdom related to the deed – and undoubtedly there is wisdom in all Allah’s decrees – but if they can’t see it, or if they believe that  this  wisdom  no  longer  applies to the modern era or to their society, they neglect the deed, discourage and mock those who perform it, and even wage  war  against  the  Book  of  Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, all the while still claiming to be Muslims!Those who do this are of varying levels. There are those who are more blatant  in  this  regard  and  have  no shame in declaring that the Sharī’ah is  “barbaric,”  or  is  inapplicable  in our  times,  and  there  are  those  who are  more  discreet,  including  many \nwho reside in the lands of kufr, refuse to perform hijrah, and make all manner of excuses in order to avoid such a lofty obligation. This, however,  is  not  surprising  when one considers that the sacrifice and difficulty entailed in making hijrah is so great that Allah c mentioned it  in  the  above  āyah  alongside the order to kill oneself! Even the Prophets p were not exempt from the  difficulty  involved  in  making hijrah, including the best of mankind g, who made hijrah to a city whose  population  included  some treacherous  Jews  and  hypocrites and  was  surrounded  by  hostile Bedouin  tribes  after  first  leaving the protection of his own tribe and relatives, facing an assassination attempt, and seeking shelter in a cave for a number of days. Performing hijrah is often a serious test of one’s īmān and tawakkul, and as such, it requires a believer to prepare himself by ensuring that he is ready to carry out the commands of Allah with nothing more than a simple order,  even  if  he  doesn’t  understand  the  whole  wisdom  behind it. Allah c says, {But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not} [Al-Baqarah: 216].\nnarration \nAlso,  one  can  take  from  the aforementioned of Thābit  Ibn  Qays  that  a  believer must  demonstrate  confidence  in his  willingness  to  obey  Allah  and His  Messenger  in  the  most  difficult  of  circumstances  and  not second-guess  himself,  even  when facing  a  hypothetical  scenario. Doing so does not constitute tazkiyat (self-promotion) when accompanied with a correct intention, such as for the purpose of  displaying  honor  and  strength in front of the kuffār, as was done by Thābit h in front of the Jew, or for the purpose of inciting oneself towards the obedience of Allah \nan-nafs \nand His Messenger, and this is of even greater significance, for in the aforementioned āyāt, Allah c says, {And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger – those will be with the ones  upon  whom  Allah  has  bestowed favor} [An-Nisā’: 69], and in  the  āyāt  preceding  this,  Allah c says, {And We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by permission  of  Allah}  [An-Nisā’: 64]. So the believer must be conscious of his level of obedience to Allah and His Messenger, and incite  himself  in  that  regard.\nConcerning  the  words  of  Allah,  {But  if  they  had  done  what they were instructed, it would have been better for them and a firmer position [for them in faith]} [AnNisā’: 66], at-Tabarī mentions that as-Suddī  explained  “a  firmer  position” to mean “a stronger tasdīq (affirmation  of  the  truth).”  This is appropriate, for indeed one can affirm the truth of Islam with his words, but if this is not backed by lofty deeds such as hijrah then it is often  merely  lip  service,  as  mentioned earlier concerning the hypocrites. As such, Allah is teaching us  that  by  performing  the  deeds we’ve been instructed to do – particularly the difficult ones that require  a  greater  level  of  obedience and  sacrifice  –  the  Muslim  lends more strength to his claim that he is a believer. As a result, Allah c grants him two tremendous favors, as  mentioned  in  the  two  subsequent āyāt: {And then We would have given them from Us a great reward. And We would have guided  them  to  a  straight  path}  [AnNisā’:  67-68].\nMay  Allah  make  us \nfrom among those who do not shy away from  performing  difficult  deeds that  bring  us  guidance  and  adherence to the straight path in the Dunyā  followed  by  tremendous rewards  in  the  Hereafter.\n191\f"

These 11 are the following:\n1) The Sariyyah of Sāhil al-Bahr: This occurred in the Ramadān of the first year after the Hijrah. It was  the  first  expedition  dispatched  in  Islam.  The Prophet    appointed  Hamzah    as  its  leader and  sent  him  with  30  men  from  the  Muhājirīn. They went out to face a trade caravan belonging to Quraysh that had come from Shām. They reached Sīf Al-Bahr, an area on the coast of the Red Sea, facing  the  kuffar  and  preparing  rows  for  battle. Majdī Ibn ‘Amr al-Juhanī who was an ally of both sides, came between the two sides and as a result they did not fight.\n2) The Sariyyah of ‘Umayr Ibn ‘Adī al-Khitmī: This occurred in the Ramadān of the second year after the Hijrah. The Prophet  dispatched this expedition to  kill  ‘Asmā’  Bint  Marwān,  a  woman  who  used to insult Islam and incite against the Prophet . ‘Umayr Ibn ‘Adīy al-Khitmī came to her house at night and placed his sword on her chest, applying pressure until he had carried it through to her back.\n3)  The  Sariyyah  of  Zayd  Ibn  Hārithah:  In  the Ramadān  of  the  sixth  year  after  the  Hijrah,  the Prophet    dispatched  an  expedition  for  Banū Fazārah in a region of al-Qurā Valley. The reason was that men from Banū Fazārah had intercepted a trade caravan belonging to the Muslims and looted it. Zayd Ibn Hārithah left for them while heading a troop of the Prophet’s companions. They reached them in the morning and surrounded them and took Umm Qirfah Fātimah Bint Rabī’ah al-Fazāriyyah. She  was  an  old  woman  venerated  and  obeyed  by her people. She had prepared 40 cavaliers from her sons and her son’s sons to kill the Prophet . The noble companion Zayd Ibn Hārithah killed them all including Umm Qirfah.\n4) The Sariyyah of ‘Abdullāh Ibn ‘Atīk: This occurred in the Ramadān of the sixth year after the Hijrah. The tribes of al-‘Aws and Khazraj used to compete in  their  defense  of  the  Prophet  .  So  when  the ‘Aws killed Ka’b Ibn al-Ashraf, who used to cause the  Prophet    harm,  the  Khazraj  searched  for someone who was similar to him in opposition to the Messenger of Allah  . They found their target in Abū Rāfi’ Salām Ibn Abī Haqīq an-Nadrī. He was the one who gathered the parties on the day of the Khandaq (Trench) and prepared the Ghatafān tribe to fight the Messenger of Allah . He would also disparage Allah’s Messenger  in the various gatherings. The Khazraj from the Sahābah sought permission from the Prophet  to kill Abū Rāfi’. He gave them permission so they sent five of their members  with  ‘Abdullah  Ibn  ‘Atīk  leading  them. The sariyyah raided the house of Abū Rāfi’, killed him, and returned.\n5) The Sariyyah of Ghālib al-Laythī: In the Ramadān of the seventh year after the Hijrah, the Prophet  sent this detachment to Banū ‘Uwāl and to Banū ‘Abd Ibn Tha’labah, two tribes from the Bedouins of Najd. The men of the two tribes used to conduct raids  on  the  outskirts  of  al-Madīnah  whilst  the Muslims  were  pre-occupied  with  their  battles against Quraysh and the Jews. Under the leadership of Ghālib al-Laythī, 130 fighters from the Muslims marched towards them. They attacked them at the time of Fajr and killed everyone who stood against them.  The  remaining  fled.  They  seized  livestock and sheep from them which they took back to alMadīnah.\n6)  The  Sariyyah  of  Abū  Qatādah  as-Salamī:  This occurred in the Ramadān of the eighth year after the Hijrah. This was at the time that the Prophet  contemplated attacking Makkah. He sent Abū Qatādah  as-Salamī  with  8  others  to  Batn  Idam (a valley north of Makkah). This was in order to trick Quraysh with regards to the true goal of the Muslims, and make them think that the Muslims were  targeting  that  area  and  not  Makkah.  The sariyyah reached the target without facing anything and so departed, joining up with the Muslim army.\n7)  The  Sariyyah  of  Khālid  Ibn  al-Walīd:  This \ndabiq\n\fFSA  secularists  join  hands  with  the  atheist PKK to fight the Islamic State\nThe  next  few  months  would  see  the  crusaders focusing  three  quarters  of  the  airstrikes  in  Iraq and  Shām  on  the  city  of  ‘Ayn  al-Islām  alone in  an  attempt  to  dislodge  the  mujāhidīn  –  all this  in  support  of  the  “fearsome”  PKK  fighters. Despite  the  obvious  incompetence  of  the  PKK in facing the Islamic State, the crusader coalition continued  to  provide  them  with  close  air  cover in their clashes against the mujāhidīn. The PKK would claim that they were advancing against the Islamic State, when the reality was that they and their FSA allies would simply move into any given area after the crusaders had already bombed the Islamic State positions there, leaving the area up for grabs. The PKK and their allies weren’t fighting for territory, they were simply hiding and waiting it out, letting the crusaders do the work and then walking in and reaping the “fruits” when it was all over. These cowardly tactics are the reason that they and their FSA allies – Jamāl Ma’rūf4, Abū ‘Īsā ar-Raqqah5,  and  ‘Abdul-Jabbār  al-‘Akīdī6  –  were recently  able  to  advance  on  the  towns  of  Sulūk and Tall Abyad in Wilāyat ar-Raqqah.7 4 An FSA leader and former ally of the Jawlānī front.5 The former leader of the Jawlānī front in ar-Raqqah up until three months into the Sahwah. He was disowned by the Jawlānī front because they were supposedly no longer able to make contact with him – not because of his kufr – and yet everyday they claim to make contact with Dhawāhirī’s al-Qā’idah all the way in Khurāsān!6 A former leader in the so-called “Liwā’ at-Tawhid.”7 PKK advances have been coupled with ethnic cleansing carried out against Arabs and Turkmen for the sake of establishing a purely Kurdish “American Kurdistan.” The secularist Kurds’ hatred of Arabs in particular leads them to hate Islam by extension and even sympathize with the Jews and their Jewish state! Despite this fact, the statement released by the Sahwāt condemning the PKK does not make takfir of them, nor does it denounce \nCrusader airstrikes on ‘Ayn al-Islam turned the city into rubble\nYet  being  the  incompetent  proxies  that  they are,  the  PKK  –  shortly  afterwards  –  found themselves flanked by Islamic State soldiers who infiltrated  their  territory  and  entered  ‘Ayn  alIslām once more, with further gains being made by the mujāhidīn thereafter in the southern and western  countryside.  This  is  in  addition  to  the Khilāfah’s offensive in Wilāyat al-Barakah where the mujāhidīn advanced on the city of al-Barakah \ntheir hatred of Islam and the Sharī’ah. Rather, it focuses exclusively on a nationalist issue, denouncing their oppression of Syrian Arabs and Turkmen, and declaring that they do not approve of dividing “the Syrian nation.”\ndabiq\n\f"

        "@value": "eat him” [Al-Badr at-Tāli’]. It is not surprising then to hear that when Ismā’īl defeated the emir of Merv, he dismembered him – dispatching his limbs across Persia – and covered his skull with gold and gems to use it as a chalice at social events.\nIsmā’īl’s  claim  was  that  he  received  instructions  from  the awaited “Mahdī,” becoming “Allah’s representative on earth” to usher in a new state and sponsor the 12 imāms considered “infallible”  by  the  Rāfidah.  Due  to  his  Sūfī  background,  he claimed to receive “ilhām ghaybī,” a kind of “gnostic inspiration,” resulting in his followers ascribing a divine status to him, even considering him “Allah’s spirit incarnate” – we seek refuge with Allah from such blatant kufr!\nWith the full support of the Qizilbāsh1 Rāfidī militia, Ismā’īl killed  scores  of  Muslims,  especially  targeting  any  scholars teaching  the  Sunnah.  He  massacred  thousands  upon  thousands and burned all the books of Ahlus-Sunnah, not even sparing  their  copies  of  the  Qur’ān.  Originally  hosting  an overwhelming  Sunni-majority  population,  Persia,  eastern Iraq, and Khurāsān were once bustling with knowledge conveyed by the likes of linguists Sībawayh and al-Azharī; hadīth masters al-Bukhārī and Muslim; mufassirīn at-Tabarī and alBaghawī;  and  fuqahā’  al-Marwazī  and  Ibnul-Mundhir.  But once controlled by the Safawiyyah, these lands became virtually void of scholarship.\nAn  age  of  darkness  quickly  spread  over  the  once  enlightened Persia. Ismā’īl and his descendants worked to forcefully convert the Sunni majority to the Rāfidī religion. The same took place in other Sunni majority lands, including Azerbaijan. Arab Rāfidī “scholars” from Lebanon, Bahrain, and Iraq were imported to teach their deviant tenets. The most famous of them – and one of the first to arrive – was ‘Alī Ibn al-Husayn al-Karakī (died 940AH), who was given the position of “Shaykhul-Islām” and put in charge of an official agency established to oversee the conversion of Ahlus-Sunnah. It was alKarakī who issued the fatāwā allowing Ithnā-‘Ashrī Rāfidah to use military force to establish their rule, thus “substantiating” Ismā’īl’s claims and justifying all of his abuses. Many Sunnis left Persia, but those who stayed were persecuted, having to decide to either apostatize or face death. Regarding this process and his cruelty to Ahlus-Sunnah, Ismā’īl said, “This matter concerns me not, as Allah and the infallible imāms are with me, so I fear no one. If any of my subjects voice any objection, I shall unsheathe my sword and leave none alive.”\nThe  adhān  was  altered  to  reflect  Rāfidī  “fiqh,”  adding  the phrase “ashhadu anna ‘alīyyan walīyullāh” (“I testify that ‘Alī is the walī of Allah”). Imāms were ordered to curse Abū Bakr as-Siddīq, ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattāb, and ‘Uthmān Ibn ‘Affān  during every Jumu’ah sermon.\n1   These were Turkic militias organized by Ismā’īl’s father and known as the Qizilbāsh (Turkish for “Redheads”) because of their crimson crowns of twelve gores each, representing their allegiance to the Twelver sect.\nSunni  graveyards  were  desecrated  and  their  masājid  destroyed. Tomé Pires, a crusader and Portuguese ambassador to China, who traveled through Persia during 916 and 917AH, witnessed this, saying, “He [Ismā’īl] renovates our churches yet destroys the masājid of Muslims who follow the Sunnah” [Summa  Oriental].\nIn imitation of Ibn Buwayh, a Rāfidī leader of the fourth century, Ismā’īl revived public observance of al-Husayn’s death, the rituals of which were described by Ibn Kathīr, who said, “Orders were given [by Ibn Buwayh] for the markets to close, for women to wear hair-woven sackcloths, and to go out with their faces and hair uncovered, as they slapped their faces and wailed  for  al-Husayn  Ibn  ‘Alī  Ibn  Abī  Tālib.  Ahlus-Sunnah were unable to prevent this due to the number of Shī’ah and their dominance, as the ruler was on the side of the Shī’ah” [Al-Bidāyah  wan-Nihāyah].\nFestivities marking the assassination of ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattāb r were also established during this time. This practice was supported  by  Muhammad  Bāqir  al-Majlisī  (died  1111AH), regarded as one of the most important Safawī palace “scholars” also given the title “Shaykhul-Islām” by the “shāh.” On celebrating  ‘Umar’s  death,  he  said,  “What  is  known  among Shī’ah in the major cities and lands of our present time is that it [the assassination of ‘Umar] was on the 9th of Rabī’ al-Awwal, and it is a day of celebration” [Bihār al-Anwār]. He then mentioned a fabricated report as evidence that this was the day of ‘Umar’s death (which was actually on the 26th of DhulHijjah) and that it is to be considered the greatest ‘īd for the supporters  of  Ahlul-Bayt!\nLike  present-day  Rāfidah,  the  Safawiyyah  were  known  for their allegiance to crusaders. Ismā’īl – then in control of Hormuz – allied with the crusader Portuguese between 921 and 927AH  to  assist  them  in  their  conquest  of  al-Bahrayn  and al-Qatīf in the eastern Arabian Peninsula, directly defying one of the Prophet’s final command’s to expel the mushrikīn from \nA  Rāfidī  shrine  in  Iran  dedicated  to  Abū Lu‘lu‘ah  al-Majūsī,  the  killer  of ‘Umar  h\n\fBengal – On the 7th of Safar, Islamic State security units carried out an operation in the vicinity of Dinajpur where the Italian crusader named Piero Parolari, who was working as a missionary in the area, was shot several times using a silenced pistol, leaving him critically wounded. This followed an operation conducted two weeks earlier on the 25th of Muharram that targeted one of the heads of kufr from the Bahā’ī sect in Dhaka known as Rūhul-Amīn who works as the director of the Bahā’ī center in the region of Rangpur. He was targeted with silenced pistols, leaving him critically wounded. Also in Rangpur, in the vicinity of Kūnyā, the murtadd Rahmat ‘Alī, a leading member of the ruling Awami League, was returning home on the 27th of Muharram when he was successfully apprehended and killed. In addition to targeting individuals, the soldiers of the Khilāfah in Bengal have also carried out attacks on the murtaddīn’s temples of shirk. On the 14th of Safar, they targeted a Rāfidī temple funded and overseen by the Iranian embassy. The attack took place in Bogra District and resulted in a number of mushrikīn being killed and injured after being hit by automatic weapons fire. Just one month later, our istishhādī brother, Abul-Fidā’ al-Banghālī, entered into a temple of the Qadiyānī murtaddīn in the area of Bagmara in Rajshahi District armed with an explosive belt. He detonated his explosive belt in their midst, injuring 30 of them. May Allah accept him among the shuhadā’. Two weeks later, the soldiers of the Khilāfah eliminated the murtadd known as Samir Uddin – who had become a Christian and was working as a missionary – by stabbing him with a knife in the district of Jhenaidah.\nWilāyat Hadramawt – On the 8th of Safar, the soldiers of the Khilāfah launched a major surprise assault on Yemeni barracks west of Hadramawt. The operation began with an assault on the Shubām, Sirr, and al-Qārrah barracks on the road between the regions of Say’ūn and al-Qutun after first cutting off their supply routes. The mujāhidīn succeeded in capturing the barracks and also targeted support divisions with explosive devices. They also destroyed four military vehicles killing all the soldiers inside, with the Yemeni army then dispatching another force to regain control of the situation. The new force was then targeted by an istishhādī operation carried out by our brother Battār al-‘Adanī. He detonated his explosive vehicle in their midst, killing and wounding dozens of them. May Allah accept him among the shuhadā’. Meanwhile, the soldiers of the Khilāfah succeeded in hitting a helicopter after targeting it with heavy machine guns, and the bulk of these operations led to at least 50 murtaddīn being killed.\nTunisia – On the 12th of Safar, our istishhādī brother Abū ‘Abdillāh at-Tūnusī rushed towards a bus carrying members of the presidential guard on Muhammad al-Khāmis Street in the center of the Tunisian capital. When he reached his target  he  detonated  his  explosive  belt,  killing  nearly  20 \nThe  Qādiyānī  temple  attacked  by the  mujāhidīn  of  Bengal\nThe  remnants  of  the  bus  that  was carrying Tunisian presidential guards\nThe  dead  murtaddīn  killed  by  Abū ‘Abdillāh  at-Tūnusī  (may  Allah  accept  him)\n\f"

        "@value": "A pagan church in Finland\nleft not knowing what to believe in, but I always had faith in the Creator and that He should be worshiped alone.\nI first heard about Islam when we were doing religious  studies  at  school.  We  covered  a  number  of different religions, including Islam. In the very first class, the teacher – who wasn’t even a Muslim – recited the shahadah in Arabic and then explained to us  that  this  was  the  Islamic  testimony  of  faith. We learned about the five pillars of Islam on a very basic level, but some things were portrayed in a manner that seemed nonsensical to me. For example, we were told that during the fasting month of Ramadan, Muslims don’t eat and drink all day but they stay up all night eating and partying. My next encounter with Islam was when I got married. My husband was brought up in a Muslim family but he wasn’t practicing at all. We had children together but got divorced a few years afterwards. At that point, I really wanted to learn about Islam, and because of the blessed events of September 11th,  I  would  always  see  Islam  mocked  in  the  media,  but  I  was  still  curious  and  wanted  to  find  out more about this religion. At the same time, I had a neighbor who had introduced me to Islam a few years earlier. So she let me borrow a copy of the Quran that was translated into my own language. The translation wasn’t so good, but she was good at explaining, so if I didn’t understand anything she would clarify it for me. What struck me most as I was reading the Quran were the verses about Hellfire and the punishment in the Hereafter.\nNot long afterwards, I knew that this religion really was the truth. I started learning to pray on my own because I thought I had to learn everything before  becoming  Muslim.  I  have  to  admit  though,  I \nwas scared and nervous because I didn’t understand a lot of things. I would think to myself, “How would my parents react if I were to become a Muslim? How would my colleagues react?” It felt like a big ordeal even though I knew in my heart that I had to do this. So when I was coming back from work one day and I saw my neighbor on the bus, I asked her, “Would you  like  to  teach  me  how  to  pray?”  She  replied  by asking, “Do you want to become a Muslim?” At that moment, I felt myself thinking, “Yes, I do.” So I said, “Yes,” and both her and her husband began crying. I pronounced the shahadah in their home and they began teaching me how to pray. It was a wonderful feeling.  After  continuously  searching  for  the  truth, finding it was just such a relief. I felt so much peace.I can’t say that things were easy after becoming a Muslim, but it did bring pleasure to my heart nonetheless. Things weren’t easy with my parents. At first, they didn’t react much, but one year later when I remarried, they began having a problem with it. When I started wearing hijab, they would make things difficult.  They  would  argue,  “Even  Muslims  that  were raised Muslim don’t wear it, so why do you?” They were not happy, and it was funny how their Christianity came out more than ever at that point. Before that, they wouldn’t speak about Christianity at all, but suddenly they were mentioning it more frequently, saying things like, “This is the religion of our forefathers.” All of this was to try to bring me back to their religion. I felt the same with my colleagues, who would ask me why I had made this decision. This was the case because I was the only Muslim they would see regularly.I lived in the capital, and although there were Muslims  there,  it  wasn’t  the  same  as  in  other  European countries;  the  Muslim  community  was  very  small. \n\fThe remnants of aNusayri \n \nplane\n \nThemuahdn\nj\ni\ni\n i\n \nnKhayr \nW\nilayah\nJazair Wilayah – On the 8th of Rajab,  six  soldiers  of  the  murtadd Algerian  army  were  killed  and  another nine were wounded when the soldiers of the Caliphate detonated an explosive device as the murtaddin passed by on the Mount Wahsh road in the area of Qusantinah. Less than a week later, the soldiers of the Caliphate  detonated  several  explosive  devices  on  Algerian  soldiers as  they  were  sweeping  the  area  of Qurush in Jijel in the northeastern region of Jazair.\nNinawa Wilayah – On the 9th of  Rajab,  six  American  helicopters backed by two warplanes attempted to carry out a special forces raid at dhuhr in the area of Sabuniyyah on the road between Mosul and Tal’afar.  The  soldiers  of  the  Caliphate succeeded, by Allah’s grace, in foiling the operation after targeting the warplanes  using  antiaircraft  guns, driving  the  Crusaders  away  in  defeat.\nKhayr Wilayah – On the 11th of Rajab, the soldiers of the Caliphate,  by  Allah’s  grace,  succeeded  in completely  capturing  the  remaining Nusayri positions in the industrial  neighborhood  in  the  city  of Khayr after attacking it from several points using various types of weapons. They killed several murtaddin, with the rest fleeing in terror, and \nthe battle moved to the outskirts of the  neighborhood  of  Tahtuh.  The mujahidin  likewise  captured  several  weapons  and  various  types  of ammo as ghanimah. Less than two weeks later, they launched a surprise attack on Nusayri locations and fortifications  separating  between  the industrial  neighborhood  and  the neighborhood of Tahtuh. This came after one of the mujahidin created openings in the Nusayri line of defense using a bulldozer, paving the way  for  Islamic  State  infantrymen to stealthily advance and carry out a  surprise  attack.  They  succeeded in  capturing  several  points  where the murtaddin were entrenched after they fled in defeat. During the course of the same week, they carried out attacks on several Nusayri army locations in the neighborhood of Tahtuh and succeeded in capturing  them.\nBengal – On the 15th of Rajab, the soldiers of the Islamic State assassinated a university professor in the  city  of  Rajshahi  for  calling  to atheism. On the 22nd of Rajab, the soldiers of the Caliphate targeted a Hindu mushrik in the city of Tangail  who  was  known  for  insulting the  Prophet  Muhammad  g  and killed him by stabbing him with a knife. On the 29th of Sha’ban, the soldiers  of  the  Khilafah  succeeded \nin  assassinating  Sunil  Gomes,  one of the Christian heads of disbelief. He was killed in the village of Bonpara in Northwest Bangladesh. On the 2nd of Ramadan, the soldiers of the Caliphate carried out a security operation in which they succeeded in killing a Hindu priest known as Ananta  Gopal  Ganguli  in  the  district of Jhenaidah in Western Bangladesh.  On  the  5th  of  Ramadan, the soldiers of the Caliphate assassinated a Hindu mushrik by stabbing him  with  knives.  On  the  27th  of Ramadan, five inghimasi soldiers of the Caliphate carried out an attack on the Artisan Restaurant, which is frequented  by  Crusader  foreigners of varying nationalities, in the city of  Dhaka.  The  mujahidin  held  a number of hostages as they engaged in a gun battle with apostate Bengali police, and succeeded in killing and injuring dozens of disbelievers before  attaining  shahadah.\nSomalia – On the 17th of Rajab,  the  soldiers  of  the  Caliphate detonated an explosive device on a military  vehicle  belonging  to  African  Crusader  forces  in  the  area  of Taridish in the city of Mogadishu, with the blast destroying part of the vehicle.

The Sharī’ah of these people necessitates preferring ‘Uqbah  Ibn  Abī  Mu’ayt  and  Abū  Jahl  to  Bilāl the  Ethiopian  and  Salmān  the  Persian.  Third, it  opposes  the  bond  between  the  believers. Rasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alahyi  wa  sallam)  said, ‘The  believer  to  the  believer  is  like  a  building, each  part  holding  up  the  other’  [Reported  by al-Bukhārī and Muslim on the authority of Abū Mūsā al-Ash’arī]. He (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) also  said,  ‘The  example  of  the  believers  with regards to their love, mercy, and sympathy is like that of a single body, if a limb feels pain, the rest of  the  body  responds  to  it  with  sleeplessness and fever’ [Reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim on  the  authority  of  an-Nu’mān  Ibn  Bashīr].  … Fourth, it is based upon the da’wah to jāhiliyyah and  partisanship.  Allah  (ta’ālā)  said,  {When those who disbelieved had put into their hearts hamiyyah – the hamiyyah of Jāhiliyyah} [Al-Fath: 26].  Rasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam) said, ‘Whoever calls to ‘asabiyyah (factionalism) is not one of us’ [Reported by Abū Dāwūd on the authority of Jubayr Ibn Mut’im]” [Adhillah ‘AlalMu’minīn A’izzah ‘Alal-Kāfirīn].\nAmīrul-Mu’minīn  Abū ‘Umar  al-Baghdādī (rahimahullāh)  also  said,  “Sadly,  some  of  the fledglings of secularism spread the occupation’s lie, formulated a basis for it, argued in favor of it, and raised the banner of blindness in the name of  nationalism  and  patriotism,  both  of  which are exactly what the Magian state constitution entails.  They  made  the  resources  of  Iraq  – especially  the  water  and  oil  –  the  property  of those who possess Iraqi citizenship! So what if Rasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  were to migrate to our lands? Indeed, he (sallallāhu ‘alayhi  wa  sallam)  migrated  to  a  land  other than his and settled in a home other than his. \n8 ARTICLE\nSo  are  those  resources  halāl  for  him  and  his Companions  in  accordance  with  the  doctrine of  these  people?  No.  As  for  him  (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and the muhājirīn after him having authority and leadership, then for that to occur would necessitate facing the harshest of opposition from these people! How not, when these people are those who said, ‘Iraq is for all the  Iraqis  and  its  resources  are  the  property of all the Iraqis.’ Yes, for all of the Iraqis, even if they are from the Yazīdī devil worshippers or Sabian  Mandaeans.  All  of  them  according  to them  have  equal  rights  whether  he  is  a  Sunnī Muslim or Rāfidī Magian! It does not concern him whether this Iraqi worships our Glorious Lord or a rebellious devil. His right will be protected! O muwahhidīn, our creed is that a Muslim is our brother  even  if  he  is  a  Filipino  Asian  and  that the devil worshipper is our enemy even if he is definitely Iraqi” [Fa’ammaz-Zabadu Fayadhhabu Jufā’ā].\nOn “25 December 2014,” the Shāmiyyah Front was  announced  in  Aleppo.  It  consists  of  the “Islamic”  Front,  the  Army  of  “Mujāhidīn,”  the “Nūr ad-Dīn Zinkī” Movement, “Fastaqim Kamā Umirt,” the Authenticity and Development Front, and most recently, the Hazm Movement. Most of these factions are members of the nationalist Syrian Revolutionary Command Council. All these factions receive supposedly “unconditional” aid from either the Gulf regimes, the CIA, the Syrian National Coalition, or the Free Syrian Army (FSA) Supreme Military Council while “not belonging” to  any  of  them.  In  “February  2015,”  the  new front  agreed  with  the  Kurdish  Autonomous Democratic  Administration  and  the  People’s Protection  Units  (YPG)  –  the  armed  branch  of the Democratic Union Party (PYD), which is the Syrian  branch  of  the  Kurdistan  Workers’  Party (PKK)  –  to  implement  the  Sharī’ah  in  ‘Afrīn! How  exactly  the  nationalist  “Islamists”  plan  to implement  the  “Sharī’ah”  alongside  Marxist and  democratic  secularists  is  unfathomable. One question to ask them is whether or not the crusader planes backing the PKK in ‘Ayn al-Islām will aid in the implementation of the “Sharī’ah”…\n\fpeople  concerning  them.  They  all  counseled him  to  accept  prayer  from  them  and  leave zakāh up to them. So he said, ‘By Allah, if they were to withhold a short rope that they used to give Rasūlullāh (sallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam), I would wage jihād against them.’ If not for what Abū  Bakr  had  done,  the  people  would  have practiced ilhād (heresy) concerning zakāh until Resurrection Day” [Tārīkh Dimashq].\n‘Umar (radiyallāhu ‘anh) said, “By Allah, a day or night of Abū Bakr’s (radiyallāhu ‘anh) is better than ‘Umar and the family of ‘Umar since they were born … As for the day then it was the day that  Rasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam) passed away and those who apostatized from the  Arabs  apostatized  and  said,  ‘We  will  pray but not give zakāh nor collect it. So I came to him never neglecting to advise him. I said, ‘O Khalīfah  of  Rasūlullāh,  attract  the  people  and be soft with them, for it is as if they’ve been deserted.’  So  he  said,  ‘I  had  hoped  for  your support and you came with your forsaking? Are you severe in Jāhiliyyah and cowardly in Islam? With what may I attract them? With contrived poetry  or  fabricated  sorcery?  That  can  never be!  The  Prophet  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam) passed away, the revelation has ceased, and the religion has been completed. Shall it decrease while I am still alive! By Allah, I will wage jihād \nABŪ BAKR AS-SIDDĪQ’S MONUMENTAL STANCE\nagainst them as long as my hand can still hold the sword, even if they only withhold from me a short rope!’ So I saw him to be wiser and firmer than me in this. He disciplined the people over matters, making their hardships easier for me to  deal  with  when  I  was  given  authority  over them. This was his day” [Musnad al-Fārūq – Ibn Kathīr; Jāmi’ al-Usūl – Ibnul-Athīr].\n(sallallāhu \n‘alayhi  wa \nAbū  Hurayrah  (radiyallāhu  ‘anh)  said,  “When Rasūlullāh sallam) passed away, Abū Bakr was appointed khalīfah after  him,  and  the  Arabs  apostatized,  ‘Umar (radiyallāhu ‘anh) said, ‘How can you fight the people  when  Rasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa sallam)  has  said,  ‘I  was  ordered  to  fight  the people until they say, ‘There is no god but Allah.’ So whoever says it, then his wealth and blood is saved from me except by its due right, and their judgment is for Allah.’’ Abū Bakr said, ‘By Allah, I  will  fight  those  who  differentiate  between prayer  and  zakāh,  for  zakāh  is  from  the  right due upon wealth. By Allah, if they were to resist giving me a short rope that they used to give to  Rasūlullāh  (sallallāhu  ‘alayhi  wa  sallam),  I would fight them over their resistance to giving it.’ ‘Umar (radiyallāhu ‘anh) said, ‘By Allah, as soon  as  I  saw  that  Allah  opened  Abū  Bakr’s heart (radiyallāhu ‘anh) towards war, I knew it to be the truth’” [Al-Bukhārī and Muslim].\ndabiq\n\f"

He  also  wrote  a  few  articles  on the crusades of the era fought by the West against the Muslims.\nAll  preparations  for  the  raids  in  Paris and Brussels started with him and his older brother Ibrāhīm. These two brothers gathered the weapons and the explosives. After the  blessed  raid  in  Paris,  he  saw  another dream, which motivated him to carry out an istishhādī operation. He narrated, “The second  dream  was  three  months  ago.  It was a vision that took place from fajr until dhuhr. I arose to a high place, as if I was in space, surrounded by stars; but the sky was like the blue of night.” He then heard a voice in the dream telling him that he was created only to worship Allah and ordering him to fight for His cause and make His word supreme. He then woke up.\nAbū Walīd then narrated a third dream: “I  had  a  vision  that  also  took  place  from fajr until dhuhr, but ended at night. I saw myself on a boat along with Abū Sulaymān and another brother. Each of us had a Turkish soldier as a hostage. I had a pistol and Abū Sulaymān had a belt. I told him to give me his belt, as I would feel better having it. So he gave me the belt and I gave him my pistol. I then quickly advanced with the Turkish hostage in order to close in on other soldiers, two of whom were in front of us. I detonated my belt, killing the soldiers. My head then descended to the ground. One of the brothers working on the operation and Shaykh al-‘Adnānī took my head and said, ‘Check to see if he is smiling or not.’ I then saw my soul and those of the three soldiers. All of a sudden, the soldiers’ souls burned and vanished and, suddenly, the banner of Islam  –  represented  in  the  dream  by  the flag of the Islamic State – came out of the earth  and  was  shining  brightly.  My  soul then became full of light.” He then heard a voice in the dream telling him that he had achieved  deliverance.  Abū  Walīd  continued,  “I  prostrated  quickly  and  repeatedly pronounced  the  takbīr.  I  then  awoke  to find my heart beating fast, and I was taking quick breaths.”\nNajm al-‘Ashrāwī (Abū Idrīs al-Baljīkī)\nBrussels Airport Istishhādī\nHe was a unique man, possessing excellent manners, always in the service of his brothers, and very intelligent. His hijrah began in “2013,” when he heard the cry of Muslims in Shām. He joined Majlis Shūrā al-Mujāhidīn led by Abul-Athīr al‘Absī (may Allah accept him) and, when the traitor al-Jawlānī betrayed the Islamic State, he was one of the first, along with the rest of his group, to pledge allegiance to Amīrul-Mu’minīn Abū Bakr al-Baghdādī.\nHe participated in several battles against the Nusayrī regime before the FSA apostates started to fight the mujāhidīn. Proving  himself  steadfast  during  the  sahwah  in  Shām,  he fought them until the order came to withdraw to ar-Raqqah. He continued to participate in raids until he suffered a bullet wound to his leg in a raid against Jabhat al-Jawlānī in alKhayr.\nAfter healing for several months, he began to train in order to realize his dream of returning to Europe to avenge the Muslims of Iraq and Shām for the constant bombing by crusader warplanes. Upon completing his training, he traveled the long road to France to execute his operation. It was Abū Idrīs who prepared the explosives for the two raids in Paris and Brussels.\nMuhammad Bilqā’id (Abū ‘Abdil-‘Azīz al-Jazā’irī)Defended the Mujāhidīn During a Police Raid\nBefore returning to France, Abū ‘Abdil-‘Azīz participated in several raids against the Nusayrī regime. The most prominent of these battles were those of Kuwayris Airbase and the 17th Division. During his campaigning, he suffered an injury to his leg while fighting the sahwāt in Dimashq. He also took part in the conquest of ar-Ramādī, where a bullet struck his head.He was a man full of wisdom, the commander of a group of  inghimāsī  troops.  Liked  by  all  of  the  brothers,  he  was known for his fasting, his praying throughout the night, and his constant reading of the Qur’ān. When he heard that Abū Idrīs wanted to return to Europe to execute an istishhādī operation, he immediately decided to accompany him and assist him in his mission.\nWhile in Belgium, and during the final stages of preparation for the raid in Brussels, kāfir police stormed his apartment. Though he had the ability to escape with his team, he decided to make this his final stand and to ensure his brothers a  safe  exit.  He  exchanged  fire  with  the  Belgian  and  French forces  for  several  hours,  injuring  a  number  of  them,  as  his brothers took off into the forest.\n7\fThe Ruling on Riddah\nThe ruling of the person who commits riddah is \nthat he is killed, unless he repents before he is apprehended. Allah’s Messenger g sent Mu’ādh Ibn Jabal h to Yemen to assist Abū Mūsā al-Ash’arī h with ruling the people according to the Sharī’ah. When he arrived at the court assembly, he found there a man bound in chains. He asked Abū Mūsā, “Who is this?” He replied, “He was a Jew who accepted Islam and then became a Jew again. Sit.” Mu’ādh said, “I will not sit until he is killed. Such is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger! Such is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger! Such is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger!” So Abū Mūsā gave the order and he was killed [Reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]. His repeated statement, that “such is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger,” is a clear evidence that the ruling of one who leaves Islam after he is apprehended is that he is killed.\nAs for repenting before being caught, then Allah said, {Say, “O My slaves, those who have transgressed against  themselves,  do  not  despair  of  the  mercy  of Allah. Verily, Allah forgives all sins. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. And repent to your Lord and surrender to Him before the punishment reaches you; then  you  will  not  be  helped”}  [Az-Zumar:  53-54]. Likewise,  and  specifically  about  the  apostate,  Allah \nThe punishment for apostasy\nsaid, {How would Allah guide a people who disbelieved  after  they  believed,  having  testified  that  the Messenger is true, and clear evidences reached them, and  Allah  does  not  guide  tyrannical  people.  Those, their reward is that the curse of Allah, the angels, and all of mankind is upon them, abiding therein forever. The torment does not lessen for them, nor are they given respite, except those who repent thereafter and correct themselves, for verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful} [Āl ‘Imrān: 87-89]. It should then be no surprise  that  Amīrul-Mu’minīn  Abū  Bakr  al-Baghdādī (hafidhahullāh)  declared  that  any  of  the  apostates from the sahwāt or otherwise who repent to Allah and surrender themselves to the Islamic State will be guaranteed amnesty, even if they had killed a million mujāhidīn. But those who are caught before they repent, then there is no amnesty for them and theirs shall be a painful – and fatal – punishment.\nHistorical Examples\nDuring  the  life  and  mission  of  the  Prophet  g, \nthe issue of riddah arose on a few occasions. The most famous case was that of the ‘Uklī–‘Uranī apostates. Some men from the tribes of ‘Ukl and ‘Uraynah came to al-Madīnah, entered upon the Prophet g, and announced their Islam. They then said to him, “O  Prophet  of  Allah! We  are  a  people  of  livestock, \n\f"

Such sacrifices mirror the hardship and difficulty faced by so many Muslims who have embarked upon the path to make hijrah to the lands of jihād. Many were forced to make a choice to either leave behind their comfort and luxury, their families  and  friends,  their  wives  and children,  and  their  wealth  and  businesses,  or  to  abandon  jihād  for  the cause of Allah. Allah  said, {Say, “If your  fathers,  your  sons,  your  brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which  you  have  obtained,  commerce wherein  you  fear  decline,  and  dwellings  with  which  you  are  pleased  are more  beloved  to  you  than  Allah  and His Messenger and jihād in His cause, then  wait  until  Allah  executes  His command. And Allah does not guide the  defiantly  disobedient  people”} [At-Tawbah:  24].  As  such,  Syed  Rizwan Farook and his wife chose Allah  and the Hereafter over the Dunyā, just as the Sahābah did so before them.\nFor  those  who  wonder  how  anyone could possibly leave their children behind in order to fight and be killed for \nthe sake of Allah, we remind them of Allah’s  promise  to  care  for  those  left behind by the believers. Allah  said, {Indeed,  those  who  have  said,  “Our Lord is Allah” and then remained on a right course – the angels will descend upon them, saying, “Do not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings of Jannah, which you were promised. We  [angels]  were  your  allies  in  the worldly life and are so in the Hereafter”} [Fussilat: 30-31]. Imām Mujāhid, the  famous  mufassir  of  the  Tābi’īn, said that the meaning of {Do not fear and do not grieve} is, “Do not fear that which you are heading to of the affairs of  the  Hereafter,  and  do  not  grieve over  what  you’ve  left  behind  of  your Dunyā, including family and children, for  we  will  look  after  all  of  that  for you”  [At-Tabarī].\nThus, the believers who do trade with Allah will never lose, rather, they only stand to profit. {O you who have believed, shall I guide you to a transaction that will save you from a painful punishment? It is that you believe in Allah  and  His  Messenger  and  strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is best for you, if you should know. He will forgive for you  your  sins  and  admit  you  to  gardens  beneath  which  rivers  flow  and pleasant  dwellings  in  gardens  of  per-\npetual residence. That is the great attainment}  [As-Saff:  10-12].\nMay Allah accept the sacrifices of our noble brother Syed Rizwan Farook and his  blessed  wife,  accept  them  among the  shuhadā’,  and  use  their  deeds  as a means to awaken more Muslims in America,  Europe,  and  Australia.\nSyed and his wife did not hold back from  fulfilling  their  obligation  despite having a daughter to care for\nSyed Rizwan Farook after attaining shahādah (may Allah accept him)\nFOREWORD\n\fOn  the  21st  of  Rabī’  al-Awwal,  the tāghūt regime of Āl Sa’ūd, with the approval of their judges and the support of  their  scholastic  stooges,  executed dozens  of  great  men  whose  only  “offense” was preaching tawhīd and waging  jihād  in  the  path  of  Allah.  Most prominent  among  those  killed  were the scholars Abū Jandal al-Azdī (Fāris Āl Shuwayl az-Zahrānī), Hamd al-Humaydī,  and  ‘Abdul-‘Azīz  at-Tuwayli’ī, may Allah accept them all amongst the shuhadā’. Allah  said, {And do not say of those killed in the path of Allah, “They are dead.” Rather, they are alive but you do not perceive} [Al-Baqarah: 154].\nSince the establishment of their present state, the Saudi regime is well known to have committed more than one nullifier of Islam. The images and videos of  Saudi  “royals”  dancing,  prancing, and even kissing their crusader counterparts  as  these  “royals”  support  the crusaders  in  the  wars  against  Islam and Muslims are famous enough that no one can deny their show of mutual love,  and  Allah    said,  {You  do  not find any people believing in Allah and the  Last  Day  having  mutual  love  for whoever opposed Allah and His Messenger}  [Al-Mujādilah:  22].\nBut for one reason or another, many ignorant people often neglect to recognize the reality of the regime’s palace scholars,  which  is  that  these  scholars \nThe  martyred  shaykh,  Abū  Jandal al-Azdī  (may  Allah  accept  him)\nThe martyred shaykh, Hamd al-Humaydī (may Allah accept him)\nare  undoubtedly  murtaddīn.  Their apostasy is even grosser than any other, having studied the clear texts proving their collapse into kufr. They have sought to justify the apostasy of their masters with deception, embroidering their arguments with misquoted āyāt, ahādīth, and āthār from the Salaf. In the  severest  terms,  they  have  advised the  youth  to  reject  the  true  meaning of jihād and to replace it with national pride. The “hukm of Allah” to them is whatever the Saudi governmental ministries have deemed acceptable. Therefore, it must be understood that these scholars are not simply silent bystanders in the background.\nRather, the palace scholars of the Saudi  regime  –  from  their  “Grand  Muftī”  ‘Abdul-‘Azīz  Āl  ash-Shaykh  to  the minions  who  spread  deceitful  protāghūt propaganda atop the pulpits of their “kingdom” – are at the forefront \nof  this  effort  to  dissuade  Muslims from  jihād  and  from  upholding  the Sharī’ah, averting them from the path of Allah. Hiding behind claims of being  “Sunnī,”  “Hanbalī,”  “Salafī,”  and especially descendants and students of Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhāb, they are truly nothing more than slaves of tāghūt,  waging  war  against  the  mujāhidīn in order to maintain the status quo. It was Ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhāb r who mentioned  among  the  ten  greatest nullifiers  of  Islam,  “Eighth:  Backing the mushrikīn and aiding them against the  Muslims.  The  evidence  is  His   saying, {And whoever allies with them of you, then indeed he is of them. Verily Allah does not guide the tyrannical people}” [Ar-Rasā’il ash-Shakhsiyyah].\nWhen asked about the clear disparity between  the  Qur’ān-backed  creed  of Muhammad  Ibn  ‘Abdil-Wahhāb  and the  Saudi  regime’s  constant  coalition with  crusaders  against  Muslims,  palace  scholar  Hātim  al-‘Awnī  criticized Ibn  ‘Abdil-Wahhāb  and  considered this one of the reasons for a required revision of the texts written by the historic scholars of Najd.\nIn  their  “justification”  of  murdering mujāhidīn, the Saudis stated that the plans of some of these brothers were “to damage the nation’s economy and harm  the  Kingdom’s  status  [and]  its relations  and  interests  with  brotherly and  friendly  countries,”  specifically mentioning  “by  storming  the  U.S. Consulate  in  Jeddah.”  Such  attacks on the regime’s brothers-in-kufr were \n\f"

        "@value": "Probably the most memorable day after September 11th for many muwahhidīn was the day the Islamic State was announced nine years ago in Iraq (Ramadān 1427). It was a state based upon tawhīd and jihād with a Qurashī imām. It was a foundation for the future khilāfah. Its leadership disbelieved in defeatist compromise and relied upon Allah alone, even if such entailed being fought by the entire camp of kufr and deviance.\nA few months later, the Iraqi Sahwah was launched. The Americans  provided  corrupt  tribes  and  partisan  factions with the incentive and aid for the newly formed Sahwah to wage a treacherous war against the Islamic State. The Islamic State then, in 1427-1428AH, began losing territory to these crusader-backed apostates. It was experiencing just some of the tests and tribulations that all truthful believers face, as in the hadīth, “The people who face the severest tribulations are the Prophets, then those most like them, then  those  most  like  them.  A  person  is  tested  with  tribulation to the extent of his religious practice. If his practice is strong, the tribulation he faces is stronger. And if his practice is weak, the tribulation he faces is in accordance with his religious practice” [Sahīh: Reported by at-Tirmidhī from Sa’d Ibn Abī Waqqās].\nDuring the tumult of this Sahwah conspiracy, a point came in which it appeared to the weak-hearted that the Islamic State would be a legend of the past, reminding us of the Battle of al-Ahzāb {when they came at you from above you and from below you, and when eyes turned upwards [in fear], and hearts reached the throats and you assumed about Allah various assumptions. There the believers were tested and shaken severely. And remember when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease said, “Allah and His \nMessenger did not promise us except delusion”} [Al-Ahzāb: 10-12]. This was what occurred throughout the events of the Sahwah in Iraq. The believers were shaken severely but remained firm, whereas the hypocrites came out and began to criticize the creed and methodology of the Islamic State.\nAnd despite these great tribulations; a man spoke out with a truthful tongue and sincere heart; we consider him such and Allah is his judge. He was the recently appointed Amīr of the Believers, Shaykh Abū ‘Umar al-Husaynī al-Baghdādī (may Allah accept him). He spoke his words holding good assumptions about Allah, being certain of Allah’s promise, and having no doubts that Allah would ever forsake them. He said in his famous speech “The Harvest of the Years by the State of the Muwahhidīn,” released six months after the declaration of the Islamic State in Iraq and during the dark waves of the Sahwah:\n“The Islamic State is bāqiyah (remaining). It is bāqiyah because it was built from the corpses of the shuhadā’ and it was watered with their blood, and by this the market of Jannah was convened. It is bāqiyah because the success granted by Allah in this jihād is clearer than the sun in the middle of the sky. It is bāqiyah because it was not soiled by harām income nor a distorted methodology. It is bāqiyah by the truthfulness of the leaders who sacrificed their blood and the truthfulness of the soldiers who raised it with their forearms; we consider them such, and Allah is their judge. It is bāqiyah because it united the mujāhidīn and is the refuge of the oppressed. It is bāqiyah because Islam has begun to rise  and  climb,  the  dark  cloud  has  begun  to  scatter,  and kufr has begun to be defeated and exposed. It is bāqiyah because it is the supplication of the oppressed, the tear of the bereaved, the cry of the prisoner, and the hope of the \n1717\nFROM THE PAGES OF HISTORY: BĀQIYAH\n\fIn the Name of Allah, the Lord of all things, who permitted marriage and prohibited fornication, created us from a single soul, created from that soul its mate, and dispersed from the two of them many men and women. May blessings and peace be upon the Prophet and Messenger who disciplined and taught his companions, and upon those who are guided by his Sunnah and follow him with excellence until the Day of Judgment. As for what follows:\nIndeed, when the Sharī’ah of our Lord was eliminated, the laws and rulings of the kuffār gained power in the lands of the Muslims, Islam was shamefully abandoned, and faces turned towards promiscuous Europe, the voice of falsehood rose and with it the voices of those hostile towards the people of the religion, and the cancer of those who legislate besides Allah c ate away at the Ummah’s body. They prohibited what He permitted, and permitted what He prohibited, and one of the most manifest things that they ruined and defamed in defense of women and their rights – as they claimed  –  was  polygyny.  They  utilized  their  podiums  to that end, including the podiums of the kufrī parliaments and the secular TV channels, and placed on these podiums howling dogs, fools who do not perceive nor know their foolishness. Their poisoned words crept into the hearts of women from the lands of the Muslims, to the point that we almost couldn’t find a single woman that is accepting of this issue, except for those whom Allah protected.\nAllah c said in His clear-cut revelation, {And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then mar-\nry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice]} [An-Nisā’: 3]. This is a verse as clear as the sun that does not require extensive explanation or interpretation. Therefore, O slaves of Allah, you may marry two, three, or four women, unless you fear that you will have shortcomings in your fairness towards them or will fail to fulfill their rights, in which case you suffice with one wife. Ibn Kathīr r said, “His statement {two or three or four} [An-Nisā’: 3] means marry any women  you  wish  apart  from  the  orphans.  If  one  of  you wishes he may marry two, and if he wishes, three, and if he wishes, four.”\nIndeed, Islam was not the first to introduce polygyny. Rather, it was present in the sharī’ah of those before us. Allah’s Messenger g said, “Sulaymān Ibn Dāwūd q said, ‘I will surely  have  intercourse  with  a  hundred  women  tonight, or ninety nine, and every one of them will give birth to a knight who will wage jihād for the cause of Allah…’” [Reported from Abū Hurayrah by al-Bukhārī].\nWhat’s  strange  is  that  the  Jews  and  the  Christians  taunt the Muslims with respect to polygyny, yet if they were to look into their own books they would’ve known that it was something present in their religions, for it is stated in their books that Ya’qūb n had two wives and two concubines, and that Dāwūd n had a number of wives and concubines, as mentioned in 2 Samuel [5: 13] and 1 Samuel [25: 42 – \n191919\nNOTHINGTWO, THREE, OR FOUR\n\f"

        "@value": "This month, Dābiq interviewed the Wālī of Khurāsān Shaykh  Hāfidh  Sa’īd  Khān  (hafidhahullāh)  and  asked him  several  questions  regarding  the  Wilāyah  and  the situation on the ground there. We present the interview below.\nDābiq: How is the situation in Wilāyat Khurāsān? Does the Islamic State have territory there with tamkīn (consolidation)? Are the visible aspects of tamkīn there similar to what is manifest in Shām and Iraq?\nThe Wālī: Alhamdulillāh, the situation in Khurāsān brings good  tidings,  by  Allah’s  permission.  We  have  achieved tamkīn in the Wilāyah, but not on the same level as Iraq and Shām in terms of the magnitude of territory on the ground. The lands of Khurāsān are very vast and include “Afghanistan,” western “Pakistan,” and other lands that the murtaddīn had taken over. We have conquered and gained consolidation in five “administrative regions” here, walhamdulillāh, and in terms of the visible aspects of tamkīn, we – by Allah’s grace – establish Allah’s law therein and implement the hudūd. We have established judicial courts in these regions, offices for hisbah, offices for zakāh, and others for education, da’wah and masājid, and public services. We set up a specific division for every shar’ī and administrative duty therein and appointed qualified and specialized officials based on the personnel available from amongst the muhājirīn and ansār in the Wilāyah.\nThe hisbah in Wilāyat Khurāsān leveling graves\nDābiq: What is the importance of Wilāyat Khurāsān to Islam and the Muslims? What are the difficulties the Wilāyah faces?\nThe Wālī: Wilāyat Khurāsān has great importance to Islam and the Muslims. It had once been under the authority of the Muslims, along with the regions surrounding it. Afterwards, the secularist and Rāfidī murtaddīn conquered some  of  these  regions,  and  the  cow-worshipping  Hindus and atheist Chinese conquered other nearby regions, as is the case in parts of Kashmir and Turkistan. So the Wilāyah, \nby Allah’s permission, is a gate to re-conquering all these regions until they are ruled once more by Allah’s law, and so the territory of the blessed Khilāfah is expanded.\nAlso, the people of Khurāsān in general love Islam and warfare, and because of this, the region has a dormant force for supporting tawhīd and jihād. Thus, as the reality of the Khilāfah becomes more clear to the people of Khurāsān, they will join the Wilāyah at a greater rate and strengthen its jihād against the enemies of Islam and the Muslims, including the kuffār, the murtaddīn, and those who ally with them inside and outside the region. As such, they will be a strong building block for the Khilāfah in this part of the world. And the coming generations will be raised upon the Book and the Sunnah from a young age. This is a tremendous grace that has reached this region by way of this khilāfah, which is upon the prophetic methodology, and by way of our imām and khalīfah, Abū Bakr al-Baghdādī al-Qurashī.\nAs for the difficulties, then they are nothing but the tāghūt enemies of Allah – including “Pakistan” on one side, and “Afghanistan”  on  the  other  –  standing  with  their  armies and intelligence agencies against Islam, its khilāfah, and the wilāyah that represents it and implements its methodology in the region. These two governments attempt to create  many  problems  in  order  to  obstruct  the  jihād  of  the Wilāyah and thereby hinder the establishment of Islam and its methodology in the region. They attempt to stop the expansion  of  the  Khilāfah.  Such  is  also  the  condition  of those organizations that these two governments produce, support, or take advantage of, and to whom they extend aid, and for whom they pave the way. This leads these organizations, such as the nationalist Taliban movement, to instigate various problems in order to wage war against the Khilāfah. But how impossible it is for all these organizations and others to extinguish the light of Allah! For this is a khilāfah that rose upon the prophetic methodology and upon the foundation of tawhīd, thus all these tawāghīt together will not be able to stand before its lions – the lions of tawhīd and ‘aqīdah. The tawāghīt succeeded against the “Islamic” organizations and movements that held flimsy creeds and deficient methodologies, whether they were “da’wah”-oriented or “jihād”-oriented. As for the Khilāfah, it is a thorn – rather, an axe! – in the necks of the kuffār and murtaddīn in this region, by Allah’s power and strength.\nDābiq: Does the nationalist Taliban movement have areas of consolidation in Khurāsān? And do they rule them by Allah’s law?\nThe  Wālī:  The  nationalist  Taliban  movement  only  has control  of  some  regions  of  “Afghanistan,”  nowhere  else. As for ruling them by Allah’s law, then it does not do that. Rather, they rule by tribal customs and judge affairs in accordance with the desires and traditions of the people, tra-\n\f"

We’ve never seen anything quite like that in one institution. Then they blend in ideology which will eventually lose*, we get that, and social media.

It is durable, you  can  exchange  it  for  goods,  and  it’s  worth as much or more today as it was thousands of years ago. Now that’s real money.\nIt’s  amazing  to  think  that  a  lump  of  gold  that may  have  been  used  for  trade  thousands  of years ago is still in circulation. It may have been melted down and be part of a bullion bar or it may be worn around someone’s neck, but it’s still around. Try that with a piece of paper.\nWHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT MONEY?\nLast month the Islamic State announced plans to mint their own range of gold dinars and silver dirhams in a move to separate themselves from dollar-linked fiat currencies and to establish their own money, a currency that has intrinsic value.\nAny  country  needs  its  own  currency  and  a move by the Islamic State to gold dinars would be a smart one in today’s turbulent markets. Financial website Quartz wrote, “The gold dinar taps into a deep history of Islamic coinage that stretches back almost to the time of Muhammad himself. The Islamic dinar appeared in 696 AD, when the Umayyad empire – based in Damascus – stretched from the Iberian peninsula to the Indus River in South Asia.”\nAnd the value of gold is soaring. In 2006, I possessed a 1 kg bar of gold that was worth, at the time, around $17,000. Sadly it wasn’t mine; a bullion  dealer  loaned  it  to  me  for  an  article. Staff from all over the building heard about it and would come to ogle over its beauty. Pure gold  makes  people  go  a  bit  strange  like  that. But if I’d had the money to buy it, that same bar would be worth over $60,000 today.\nAs they move to expand the Caliphate, it would \nTHE ISLAMIC STATE HAS ANNOUNCED THE MINTING OF NEW COINS\ndabiq\n\f"

The  brother  Tāriq  Ibn  at-Tāhir  alHarzī  –  otherwise  known  as  Abū ‘Umar  at-Tunusī  –  was  killed  in Wilāyat al-Barakah, completing a life of  jihād  and  many  years  of  service working  to  help  build  the  Islamic State  and  reestablish  the  Khilāfah. He had, throughout his jihād in both Irāq and Shām, a number of different titles and held a number of different positions.\nA veteran of many years in the Islamic State, the brother first made hijrah to Iraq in 2003. He became acquainted with some of the legends of the Iraqi jihād such as Abū Mus’ab az-Zarqāwī and  Abū  Hamzah  al-Muhājir  (may Allah accept them both). The former, as  the  jihād  progressed,  made  a request for the brother to come to alFallūjah. It was a call to which Abū ‘Umar  responded,  living  great  days in the city that stood defiantly in the \nface  of  the  American  transgression on  the  lands  of  the  Muslims. Time passed,  many  kuffār  were  sent  to Jahannam,  and  the  brother  was  hit by  a  crusader  airstrike  in  which  all those who were with him were killed. This time Allah  saved him and he emerged  relatively  unharmed.  He was  later  hit  by  a  second  airstrike, resulting in his leg being severed (he later  became  well  known  for  this physical attribute).\nThe  brother  was  imprisoned  twice in Iraq, the first time escaping with a fake document under the pretense that he was Iraqi and not a muhājir. The  Americans  were  enraged  upon discovering  the  true  identity  of  the man who had slipped through their inept  fingers.  The  second  time  was in 2008 after he was sentenced to 15 years. He and a group of his mujāhid brothers escaped during an operation by  the  Islamic  State  to  liberate  the Tājī  prison.  He  was  subsequently sent  to  land  of  Shām  and  was made  responsible  for  receiving  the istishhādiyyīn  and  appointed  the \namīr of the Atmah gateway. He was a brave leader during the war against the sahwah treachery and was famous for his saying, “Allah will never grant them  victory  over  us.  We  defeated them in Iraq, and we will also defeat them  in  Shām,  by  Allah’s  bounty alone.”\nAbū ‘Umar was known for practicing zuhd with respect to his clothes and his food, earning the love and respect of  many  after  reaching  the  blessed land  of  Shām.  After  relocating, he  settled  in  Wilāyat  al-Barakah, eventually  being  appointed  as  the amīr  of  the  wilāyah’s  artillery.  This beloved  brother  and  veteran  was killed  24  hours  after  his  brother Abuz-Zubayr ‘Alī al-Harzī was killed in  Mosul.  The  two  brothers,  both avid  boxers,  together  terrorized  the kuffār, leaving this world in the same way as each other.\nHe  was  a  thorn  in  the  sides  of  the disbelieving  crusaders  and  their  slaves from  amongst  the  apostates.

The  Taliban  released another written statement fabricated with a nationalist tone and dialect in the name of the deceased Mullā ‘Umar, congratulating  the  Ummah  on  Eid al-Fitr  and  supporting  the  national Afghan the apostate  regime!  Pressure  magnified even from Akhtar’s supporters in the Pakistani  and  Afghani  intelligence, until he and his accomplices admitted to Mullā ‘Umar’s death. The political office  of  the Taliban  “emirate”  then announced  that  Mullā  ‘Umar  had passed  away  specifically  on  “23 April 2013.” Thereafter Muhammad Tayyib Āghā – the head of the political office and formerly one of the closest men  to  Mullā  ‘Umar  –  announced his resignation and declared that he considers  the  concealment  of  Mullā ‘Umar’s  death  for  a  period  of  “two and  a  half  years”  to  be  a  “historical mistake.”  This  was  followed  by  a statement from Zabihullah Mujahid (official  spokesman  of  the  Taliban “emirate”), in which he admitted to their  covering  up  of  Mullā  ‘Umar’s death since “23 April 2013.”\nAccordingly, Mullā ‘Umar had passed away at least more than a year before the  announcement  of  the  Khilāfah and  very  shortly  after  the  Islamic State’s official expansion into Shām, that is assuming he hadn’t passed away years before… So what did al-Qā’idah and  its  partisans  do  in  response  to this hoax? Did they repent and join the ranks of the Khilāfah? No… AlQā’idah’s  supporters  from  amongst \nthose  claiming  “scholarship”  wrote treatises  to  justify  the  concealment of Mullā ‘Umar’s death, not quoting the Qur’ān and the Sunnah, but the books  of  history  about  the  khalaf (the  generations  after  the  Salaf) full  of  unverifiable  events  whose personalities  are  not  even  examples for  the  Ummah!  The  few  examples from  the  Salaf  they  quoted  and distorted  involved  concealment  of  a leader’s  death  only  for  a  short  time and  only  from  a  small  part  of  the Muslim army engaged in battle, not for  months  and  years  and  certainly not from the entire Ummah!\nThe  hizbī  (partisan)  “scholars”  then exaggerated  the  ruling  on  lying  for the  sake  of  war  and  reconciliation to  include  lying  open-endedly  to the  worldwide  Muslim  Ummah  in its  entirety  from  the  far  East  to  the distant West including all its scholars, leaders,  fighters,  and  men,  all  for the  sake  of  some  loosely-defined “maslahah.”  They  even  permitted speech to be fabricated in the name of  a  dead  man  only  to  prevent  the unification of the Ummah under the obligation  of  Khilāfah  and  to  bind it  through  chains  of  taqlīd  (blind following)  to  the  evil  of  hizbiyyah (partisanship)!  Worse  yet, these “scholars”  have  thereby  paved  the way for the masses to deny anything proclaimed  to  them,  as  this  deviant precedent and its flimsy justifications means anything could be an unending lie  to  the  entire  Ummah  for  the sake  of  hizbiyyah.  And  who  knows, perhaps some of the ignorant masses will come out and allege that Mullā ‘Umar  is  still  alive,  not  dead,  and then there will be a new “occultation” claim added to those of the Rāfidah and Bātiniyyah…\nThen  suddenly  Dhawāhirī  –  who disappeared  for  almost  a  year,  since “3 September 2014” – came out and pledged allegiance to the liar Akhtar Mansūr!  This  was  despite  Akhtar’s \nauthority  being  heavily  disputed by  large  divisions  of  the  Taliban, including  those  headed  by  Mullā ‘Umar’s  son  and  brother,  as  well as  those  parties  opposing  Akhtar’s plans for  national  reconciliation international  normalization. and Several  Taliban the “Quetta Shura” in which Akhtar was “elected,”  in  objection  to  Akhtar’s authority  and  the  legitimacy  of  his “shūrā.” Other leaders resigned from their positions – such as Muhammad Tayyib  Āghā,  ‘Azīz  ‘Abdur-Rahmān, and Nek Muhammad – in protest of the hoax or in rejection of Akhtar or in pursuit of leadership!\nleaders \nleft \nYet  Dhawāhirī  pledged  allegiance. The question that follows is, will his blind  sheep  in  the  various  branches of al-Qā’idah follow suit and pledge allegiance to the infamous liar? Will they  pledge  allegiance  to  someone who rejects the fundamentals of walā’ and  barā’  and  speaks  in  the  name of  a  dead  man?  Will  they  pledge allegiance to someone who officially dispatches  political  delegations  to Safawī  Iran  and  whose  “emirate” names the Iranian regime an “Islamic state” and calls the Rāfidī leaders and masses “Muslim brothers”!\nIf they would reflect over this hoax, this  bay’ah  to  this  con  artist,  and the  deterioration  of  their  different branches  who  have  waged  a  media and  military  campaign  against  the Islamic  State,  they  would  fear  it  to be from the many just results of the mubāhalah declared more than a year ago, but sadly most of them do not think  for  themselves,  and  instead allow their personal desires and that of their blind shepherds to lead them on.\nWe ask Allah to protect us from the evils of desire, taqlīd, irjā’, hizbiyyah, and the Dajjāl.\ndabiq\n\fthat from the nullifiers of Islam was “backing  and  aiding  the  mushrikīn against the Muslims.

It will take more than bombs from the West to defeat this menace.” In it he said:\n“In  Raqqa  …  people  were  taking notice  [of  “the  West’s  inaction”].

So fight against the allies of Shaytān.

The  Carnegie Endowment  wrote  on  “20  April  2015,”  “The Islamic  State  seeks  to  infiltrate  Jordan  in  many ways. Its most effective way of establishing itself is not by attacking across the border, but by coopting Jordanian  extremist  factions  and  exploiting  the simmering  social  discontent  among  Jordanian youth. To  counter  these  trends,  the  government has sought to exploit divisions between al-Qaeda and  the  Islamic  State,  releasing  some  clerics  [alMaqdisī and al-Filistīnī] aligned with the former group  and  allowing  them  a  degree  of  media visibility.”\nThis  policy  was  even  suggested  for  Afghanistan and  Pakistan,  as  the  Islamic  State’s  presence there threatened regional stability. The crusaders of War on the Rocks wrote on “13 April 2015,” “This much is clear, however: Mullah Omar still matters  –  especially  in  South  Asia,  where  two important  developments  are  playing  out.  Both are directly tied to stability, which is Washington’s chief  interest  in  the  region.  And  regardless  of his  fate,  Mullah  Omar  will  have  an  impact  on each  of  them.  Development  number  one  is  the deepening influence of the Islamic State in South Asia. … The second key trend is Kabul’s pursuit \ndabiq\nThe Carnegie Endowment - A major crusader think-tank\npragmatism.  The  group  has  been  collaborating with  a  wide  variety  of  local  forces  that  are  not pushed to fight under its umbrella. Instead, they fight  with  Nusra  as  allies  –  a  radical  departure from the Islamic State’s model, which does not tolerate collaboration unless absolutely necessary. This  approach  has  enabled  the  Nusra  Front  to widen its network of support quickly, including the addition of some Free Syrian Army brigades in Aleppo, Hama, and Daraa.”\nThis description of the Jawlānī front was mirrored in another piece written by the crusaders of Middle East Eye on “30 April 2015.” After describing the “pragmatism”  of  the  Jawlānī  front  (cooperation with  everyone  and  non-implementation  of  the hudūd),  the  author  said,  “Nusra  could  also benefit  from  US  airstrikes  against  IS.  The  US listed the Nusra Front a terrorist organisation in December  2012,  long  before  the  emergence  of IS, but since last year the US-led intervention in Syria and Iraq has largely focused on the aim of degrading and ‘ultimately destroying’ IS. While coalition  airstrikes  have  also  targeted  Nusra positions, the group is less of a priority for the US-led campaign.”\n\f"

Or are they the controllers [of them]?} [At-Tūr: 37].\nAbsolute  power,  knowledge,  and  ownership  are attributes unique to Allah (ta’ālā). This has always been  the  faith  of  Muslims  since  the  father  of mankind  –  Ādam  (‘alayhis-salām)  –  treaded  the Earth  and  will  continue  to  be  so  until  the  last believer  passes  away  shortly  before  the  Hour. Only Allāh (ta’ālā) knows the minutest details of everything, controls all events, and possesses every atomic particle. Even the pagans of the Jāhiliyyah in the Arabian Peninsula did not doubt that Allah alone  possessed  absolute  power,  knowledge,  and ownership,  but  they  committed  shirk  in  many ways  including  attributing  partial  knowledge  of the unseen to soothsayers, assigning shares of their crops  and  livestock  to  idols,  and  claiming  their idols held some influence to intercede for them. As for claiming their idols, soothsayers, and kings had absolute or near-absolute power, knowledge, \nand ownership, then this was too much for even the corrupted fitrah of the jāhiliyyīn to tolerate.\nSadly, this shirkī attitude (both minor and major) entered the hearts and minds of many supposedly “Islamic”  leaders,  scholars,  and  callers  –  in imitation of the Arab nationalists before them – as  they  began  to  describe  the  enemies  of  Islam with  attributes  bordering  rubūbiyyah  (Allah’s lordship).  To  them,  the  kuffār  had  the  nearabsolute knowledge, power, and ownership to plot and execute any grand conspiracy of their desire. It is almost as if they attribute to them the ability to create with the word “be”! Their evil became most apparent in issues related to jihād. If one desired to perform jihād, these leaders would warn that jihād now was a conspiracy to kill off the sincere Muslim youth and thereby leave the Muslims’ lands to the secularists. If one wanted to join a jihād jamā’ah, they  would  warn  that  it  was  the  creation  of  the kuffār so as to aid in achieving kāfir interests. If jihād  operations  –  like  those  of  September  11th – were carried out against the kuffār, they would claim  these  operations  were  conspiracies  by  the kuffār to justify their aggression against Muslims. If  a  mujāhid  leader  achieved  shahādah,  they would say that the kuffār used him up and needed \nThe blessed raid on the Twin Towersin New York\ndabiq\n\fthe  crusaders!  He  did  not  wage  jihād  for  Allah’s cause to rid the Muslims’ lands of manmade laws and  pagan  domes  and  thereby  establish  a  shar’ī khilāfah.  Rather  he  fought  merely  to  unify  the “Arab” lands alone under a nationalist “caliphate” that he would rule over, but under the direction of his new crusader masters.\nDuring the various battles he and his sons led in the “Arab Revolt,” their soldiers were accompanied and  supported  by  British  crusaders  including Colonel  Cyril  Wilson,  Colonel  Pierce  C.  Joyce, Lieutenant  Colonel  Stewart  Francis  Newcombe, Herbert Garland, and Captain T.E. Lawrence (the so-called “Lawrence of Arabia”), French crusaders including  Colonel  Edouard  Bremond,  Captain Rosario  Pisanim,  Claude  Prost,  and  Laurent Depui,  and  French  apostates  including  Captain Muhammad  Ould  Ali  Raho.  The  British  would even  intervene  with  their  navy  and  air  force  in battles to give al-Husayn and his sons the upper hand against their rivals. Al-Husayn and his sons meticulously obeyed the orders dictated to them by  the  British  crusaders  so  as  to  guarantee  their backing.  The  British  eventually  appointed  them as kings over Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Hijāz. The current  tāghūt  of  Jordan  is  a  descendent  of  this same family.\nBlack  was  chosen  to  represent  the  ‘Abbāsī  state, white  to  represent  the  Umawī  state,  green  to represent the ‘Ubaydī (“Fātimī”) state, and red to represent  the  late  “Sharīf”2  leadership  of  Hijāz. In  this  symbolism,  he  mixed  between  Islamic khulafā’,  apostate  Ismā’īliyyah,  and  apostate agents.  He  needed  to  give  his  Arab  followers something  symbolic,  historical,  material,  and uniquely  “Arabian”  for  them  to  rally  around. This jāhilī banner became the flag of the so-called “Arab Revolt” he engineered. The flag was initially manufactured in Egypt by the British Military to be raised by their allies.\nSykes’s allies from amongst the Arab nationalists used  a  line  of  poetry  written  by  Safī  ad-Dīn  alHillī  –  who  died  in  750AH  –  to  endorse  these jāhilī symbols. Al-Hillī said, “Our deeds are white, our battles are black, our fields are green, and our swords are red.” No doubt, his line of poetry was written hundreds of years before the “Arab Revolt.”\nSykes, together with his peers and leaders, devised a  plan  to  further  divide  the  broken  Muslims’ lands  into  nationalist  states.  The  Muslims’  lands had  been  polluted  by  pagan  domes  (for  grave worship)  and  plagued  by  manmade  laws  at  the hands of Ottoman rulers, especially in the last two centuries before the eventual collapse of Ottoman reign.  This  fragile  condition  coupled  with  the policy of turkification – which promoted Turkish nationalism and degraded the Arabic language – aided Sykes and his allies in promoting the “Arab Revolt.”\nThe  British  began  negotiating  with alHusayn  Ibn  ‘Alī3    (the  “Sharīf”  of  Hijāz  –  died 1350AH/1931CE)  to  rebel  and  declare  an independent  Arab  nationalist  state.  Al-Husyan Ibn  ‘Alī  revolted  against  his  former  Ottoman masters and declared himself, with the permission of  the  British,  “Sultan  of  the  Arab  Lands”  and “Caliph” over a nationalist “caliphate” erected by 2 The  word  literarily  means  “the  noble.”  The  leaders  of  Hijāz  (Makkah,  al-Madīnah,  and surrounding regions) since 597AH/1200CE up until 1344AH/1925CE all descended from Qatādah Ibn Idrīs al-Hasanī (died 618AH) and were referred to by the title “sharīf” because of their Hasanī lineage. Because of the later generations’ apostasy through shirk and walā’ to the apostates and the crusaders, they are not deserving of this praiseworthy title.\n3 Because the names are similar, it should be noted that everywhere the name al-Husayn Ibn ‘Alī is used here, then it is referring to this crusader agent and not to the noble son of ‘Alī Ibn Abī Tālib (radiyallāhu ‘anh).\n“Sharīf” al-Husayn - The first in a line of Arab tawāghīt used and discarded by the crusaders\ndabiq\n\f"

We announce that this sectarian mission aims at dividing the Ummah, weakening its forces, taking its riches, and occupying the Muslims’ sanctuaries in  Makkah  al-Mukarramah  and  al-Madīnah  alMunawwarah. This is a matter that we will never allow to happen, whatever the circumstances may be. Thus we have prepared two thousand fighters from the heroes of Faylaq ash-Shām to be under the command of the Servant of the Noble Haramayn, King  Salmān  Ibn  ‘Abdil-Azīz  Āl  Sa’ūd,  so  that they defend the lands of the Noble Haramayn and defeat the enemies of the Ummah from amongst the tails and arms of Iran in the brotherly land of Yemen. We do this to support the truth and out of loyalty to the one who stood by and supported the struggle of the Syrian people. And we indeed stand up  in  defense  of  the  Muslims’  holy  sanctuaries through our humble contribution of two thousand fighters  from  the  best  of  the  sons  of  Shām.  We appeal to the countries from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to rush to stand in the face  of  this  Safawī  plan  and  to  strive  to  stop  all those who allowed themselves to transgress against our sanctities and holy sanctuaries. Indeed Iran’s insolence and that of its tails will not be deterred except  with  resolve2,  and  it  will  not  be  stopped except by the language of resolve, and this is what we  are  now  doing  with  all  strength  and  resolve, asking Allah (ta’ālā) for victory and steadfastness.”\n“{And  Our  word  has  already  preceded  for  Our servants,  the  messengers,  [That]  indeed,  they would be those given victory And [that] indeed, Our  soldiers  will  be  those  who  overcome}  [AsSāffāt: 171-173].”\n“And our last call is that all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the creation.”\n“Faylaq ash-Shām”“25 Rajab 1436 / 14 May 2015”This ends their statement of deviance.\n2 Editor’s Note: This and all subsequent usage of the word is in reference to the “Storm of Resolve” announced by Āl Salūl.\nIt  is  important  to  note  that  when  the  apostates (the Tawāghīt and the Rāfidah) fight each other, it is not permissible for the Muslim to support one party  of  apostates  against  the  other  by  fighting under  the  leadership  of  one  party  or  fighting in  its  defense.  Allah  (ta’ālā)  said,  {Those  who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve  fight  in  the  cause  of  tāghūt.  So  fight against  the  allies  of  Shaytān}  [An-Nisā’:  76]. So  it  is  not  permissible  for  the  Muslim  to  fight against Āl Salūl under the leadership of the Rāfidī Houthis nor is it permissible to fight against the Rāfidī Houthis under the leadership of Āl Salūl. If he does fight under the leadership of the tāghūt in defense of his kufrī regime, he apostatizes from Islam.  Therefore,  the  Muslim  should  know  that the obligation upon him when the apostates wage war  against  each  other  is  to  declare  his  barā’ah from  both  apostate  parties  and  –  if  he  is  able  – to perform jihād against both of them for Allah’s sake.\nAs  to  the  cause  behind  this  deviant  declaration being  released,  then  it  is  the  addiction  of  these factions  to  tāghūt  aid.  Initially,  the  tawāghīt trap  them  with  supposedly  “innocent”  and “unconditional”  aid  before  they  slide  down  a slippery slope of concessions ending with blatant apostasy.\nAnd  so,  will  the  jihād  claimants  of  the  Jawlānī front  wage  “jihād”  against  their  allies,  the shameless slaves of Āl Salūl? Or are there endless excuses  prepared  for  each  blatant  statement  of apostasy made by them? Āl Salūl have now openly occupied  parts  of  Idlib,  Halab,  and  Shām  in general through this “legion,” Zahrān ‘Allūsh, and their  brothers  from  the  “Islamic”  Front.  Worst yet, the factions of “Jaysh al-Fath” are referred to as  “Ahlus-Sunnah”  and  the  “truthful  mujāhidīn” by al-Jawlānī in his most recent speech!\nMay  Allah  expose  the  hypocritical  and  apostate allies of “al-Qā’idah” in Shām3. \n3 It is hizbiyyah and irjā’ that allowed the Syrian “al-Qā’idah” to support these apostate factions against the muhājirīn and ansār. See “The Hizbiyyīn and the Grayzone” on pages 62-66 of issue #7 and “The Irjā’ of the Jihād Claimants” on pages 52-56 of issue #8 to read about the deviance of these jihād claimants and how it led them upon this dark path.\ndabiq\n\f"

        "@value": "the people divided their religion among them into sects – each faction, in what it has, rejoicing} [Al-Mu’minūn: 53]. They are also divided about their dunyā and they consider this good. So he  came with unity regarding the religion with Allah’s statement, {He has ordained for you  of  religion  what  He  enjoined  upon  Nūh  and  that which We have revealed to you, and what We enjoined upon  Ibrāhīm  and  Mūsā  and  ‘Īsā  –  to  establish  the religion  and  not  be  divided  therein}  [Ash-Shūrā:  13]. Allah  also said, {Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become sects – you have nothing to do with them}  [Al-An’ām:  159].  He  also  prohibited  us  from being like them with Allah’s statement, {And do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them. And those will have a great punishment} [Āl ‘Imrān: 105]. He also prohibited us from dividing about the dunyā with Allah’s statement, {And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do  not  become  divided}  [Āl  ‘Imrān:  103].  The  third of these matters is that they considered disobeying the person in authority and refusing to yield to him a virtue. They considered hearing and obeying him humiliation and  disgrace.  Allah’s  Messenger    opposed  them  and ordered his companions to be patient with the injustices of the rulers2. He ordered them to hear and obey them and give them sincere advice. He was severe about this, expressed it, and repeated it. These three matters he  gathered together in the hadīth reported by al-Bukhārī and  Muslim,  ‘Allah  is  pleased  with  three  matters  for you, that you worship Him and not associate anything with Him in worship, that you hold to the rope of Allah together  and  not  divide,  and  that  you  sincerely  advise those whom Allah gives authority over you.’ No calamity occurred  in  the  people’s  religion  and  dunyā  except  by violation  of  these  three  principles  or  some  of  them” [Masā’il al-Jāhiliyyah].\nHe    also  said,  “From  the  most  amazing  things  and greatest  signs  showing  the  power  of  Allah    are  six principles  that  He    made  very  clear  more  so  than what  the  doubtful  people  think.  Thereafter,  many  of the  ‘intelligent’  people  of  the  world  and  ‘wise’  men  of mankind erred about these principles, except for a very few.  …  The  second  principle  [after  the  obligation  of tawhīd  and  prohibition  of  shirk]  is  that  Allah  ordered with unity regarding the religion and prohibited division within it. Allah clarified this with clear and conclusive evidence that the laymen can understand. He prohibited us from being like those who divided before us and thus were  destroyed.  He  also  mentioned  that  He  ordered the  Messengers  with  unity  regarding  the  religion  and 2 He refers to Muslim rulers who rule by the Sharī’ah but commit injustices, not rulers who apostatize by legislating, executing, or judging by manmade laws, nor rulers who have walā’ to the crusaders against the Muslims.\nprohibited  them  from  division  within  it.  What  makes this  clearer  is  what  the  Sunnah  came  with  of  amazing teachings in this regards. Then the matter changed until division  over  the  fundamentals  and  branches  of  the religion  became  ‘knowledge’  and  ‘fiqh  of  the  religion’! And  then  no  one  called  to  the  obligation  to  unite regarding the religion except for a ‘zindīq’ or ‘madman’! The third principle is that the fulfillment of unity is by hearing and obeying he who has been granted authority over  us  even  if  he  might  be  an  Ethiopian  slave.  Allah clarified this prevalently and sufficiently through various kinds of shar’ī and qadarī evidences. It then became the fundamental  not  known  to  most  of  the  claimants  of knowledge. What then of acting in accordance with this matter!” [Six Great Beneficial Fundamentals].\nAnd  although  jamā’ah  is  from  the  most  obvious  of obligations with even the fitrah of many animals being inclined to it, the modern claimants of Islam argue that it is better for the Ummah to have religious and political pluralism!  They  prefer  that  Ahlus-Sunnah  tolerate  the various  sects  of  bid’ah  and  even  apostasy  who  claim to belong to the Muslim Ummah. They also wish that Ahlus-Sunnah  would  permit  the  existence  of  deviant, warring, and selfish political parties and militant factions on the liberated Muslim lands! They made taqlīd (blind following)  of  their  partisan,  evil  “scholars”  an  essential aspect of “religion.” And through this, they propagated the  “virtue”  of  division  and  denounced  the  “evil”  of jamā’ah  in  their  campaign  against  the  revived  body  of Islam, the Khilāfah. How wicked are the deviant parties and corrupt “scholars”!\nTherefore  know  –  may  Allah  have  mercy  upon  you  – that  the  major  basis  for  the  religions  of  the  Jāhiliyyah was taqlīd. After Imām Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhāb   mentioned  the  first  three  aspects  of  their  religion (shirk, religious division, and political disunity), he said, “The fourth matter is that their religion is based upon principles, the greatest of which is taqlīd. It is the major principle for all the kuffār, the first of them and last of them, as Allah  said, {And similarly, We did not send before you any warner into a city except that its affluent said, “Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are, in their footsteps, following”} [Az-Zukhruf: 23]. He  also said, {And when it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has revealed,” they say, “Rather, we will follow that upon which we found our fathers.” Even if Shaytān was inviting them to the punishment of Hellfire?} [Luqmān: 21]. So he  came to them with Allah’s statement, {Say, “I only advise you of one thing – that you stand for Allah, [seeking truth] in pairs and individually, and then give thought.” There is not in your companion any madness. \ndabiq\n\fonly begin his killings by killing Quraysh. He will not accept from them anything but war and he will not offer them anything but the sword.” An-Nu’mānī also reports that Ja’far as-Sādiq said, “When al-Qā’im from the family of the Prophet emerges, he will bring five hundred people from Quraysh and strike their necks. He will then bring five  hundred  more  and  strike  their  necks.  He  will  do so  six  times  [thereby  killing  three  thousand  men  from Quraysh].  He  will  kill  them  and  their  patrons.”  He also  reports  that  Ja’far  as-Sādiq2  said,  “When  al-Qā’im emerges,  nothing  will  be  between  him  and  both  the Arabs and Quraysh except the sword.”\nSo  the  Rāfidī  “Mahdī”  speaks  in  Hebrew,  rules  by  the Torah,  is  followed  by  the  Jews,  and  kills  the  Arabs especially Quraysh! Is this a description of the Mahdī or the  Dajjāl?  Consider  that  seventy  thousand  Jews  from Asbahān  (Isfahan  of  modern-day  Iran)  will  follow  the Dajjāl as in the hadīth reported by Muslim from Anas .\nAlso consider that the Dajjāl will emerge from the region of the Khawārij as in the hadīth reported by Ibn Mājah from Ibn ‘Umar . And also consider that those who deny  Qadar  are  from  the  followers  of  the  Dajjāl  as  in the hadīth reported by Abū Dāwūd from Hudhayfah . This is important for two reasons, the Rāfidah are from the  biggest  Khārijī  sects.  They  and  the  other  Khawārij have a common root in the Jew ‘Abdullāh Ibn Saba’, who partook  in  the  mutiny  against  the  righteous  Khalīfah ‘Uthman  .  For  this  reason,  some  of  the  scholars have also referred to the Khawārij as “Saba’iyyah.”3  In 2 Note that Muhammad al-Bāqir, Ja’far as-Sādiq, and al-Hasan al-‘Askarī  were not Rāfidah. They were from the family of the Prophet  just as ‘Alī, Fātimah, al-Hasan, and al-Husayn  were from the family of the Prophet . And just as the Rāfidah fabricated lies in the name of ‘Alī and his immediate family , they fabricated lies in the name of his noble descendants .3 The closeness of the Rāfidah to the other Khawārij is visible in the walā’ between Iran \n70,000 Jews from Asbahān will follow the Dajjāl\naddition,  the  Rāfidah  are  infamous  for  pronouncing takfīr  upon  the  majority  of  the  Ummah  including  the best of the Ummah – the Companions of the Prophet  – rejecting the authority of the khulafā’, even cooperating with  the  Crusaders  and  the Tatars  against  the  khulafā’ and their Muslim subjects. The Rāfidah have a history of  massacring  Muslims  who  refuse  Rāfidī  beliefs.  This became most manifest during the Safawī empire (“15011736CE”) and its war against Ahlus-Sunnah in Persia. Finally, the Rāfidah are one of the sects of Qadariyyah, as they deny that good and evil deeds are by Allah’s qadar.\nHence  the  apostate  Rāfidah  combined  between  major shirk (worship of the family of the Prophet ), denial of  the  Qur’ān  and  the  Sunnah  (as  they  claim  the Companions  fabricated the religious texts), takfīr of the Companions   and the Mothers of the Believers , and belief in the deviant innovations of the Khawārij and Qadariyyah. When reflecting upon this and the fact that the Jews await their so-called Messiah – as the Jews deny  the  messengership  of  Jesus  ,  who  will  return before the Hour – it is expected that the Rāfidah will ally blatantly with the Jews in the future in their war against Islam and the Muslims.4 \nWe  seek  refuge  with  Allah  for  Ahlus-Sunnah  from  the evil of the Dajjāl.\nand Oman. Oman is ruled solely and populated mostly by the Ibādiyyah. The Ibādiyyah are historically a deviant Khārijī sect; but over the last centuries they have mutated into an apostate Jahmī sect. Their tāghūt “sultan” legislates manmade laws and has walā’ to the Crusaders, the Arab and non-Arab tawāghīt including Āl Salūl, and the Rāfidah.4 Although it is not possible to know with certainty how exactly such will come about, it is interesting to note that 340 Jewish American rabbis recently wrote a letter addressed to the American congress in support of American-Iranian reconciliation, as reported by “I24News” (a Jewish news channel) on “18 August 2015” in an article titled “Hundreds of US Rabbis Voice Support for Iran Nuclear Deal.” The report adds that the Jewish Defense Forces Military Intelligence Directorate’s Research Department presented its stance to the political leadership of the Jewish state and “emphasized the possible benefits that could come of the deal.”\ndabiq\n\f"

Thereafter, one should not be surprised when he sees the various factions in Shām or elsewhere siding with the Sahwah, the tawāghīt, or the crusaders, against the Islamic State.\nAfghanistan\nThe Western agentAhmad Shah Massoud\nAbdul Rasul Sayyaf (former head of the “Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan,” now a member of the tāghūt parliament), Burhanuddin Rabbani (former head  of  the  “Islamic  Society  of  Afghanistan,”  died chairman  of  the  Afghan  High  Peace  Council),  and Ahmad  Shah  Massoud  (former  military  commander, died commander of the “United Islamic Front”), were all  former  leaders  of  the  major  factions  that  fought against the communist Russians and thereafter against the  communist  Afghans.  All  three  fought  alongside ‘Abdullāh ‘Azzām  and were formerly praised by him in  his  speeches  and  letters.  After  the  collapse  of  the communist  Afghan  regime,  they  together  along with  others  established  the  so-called  “Islamic  State of  Afghanistan”  in  “1992.”  This  “state”  would  later organize  the  “United  Islamic  Front  for  the  Salvation of Afghanistan” AKA the “Afghan Northern Alliance,” which fought on behalf of the crusaders and tawāghīt, this  becoming  most  manifest  after  the  blessed operations of September 11th.\n1  Note:  Some  of  the  individuals  and  factions  that  will  be  mentioned  never  fought  for Allah’s cause to begin with – similar to the condition of many of the factions in Shām – and yet some of the ignorant consider them “mujāhidīn” just because they fought against crusaders, communists, and other kuffār for nationalist reasons.\nTajikistan\nAbdullo Nuri (former head of the “Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan”) fought against the communists of Tajikstan. Amīr Khattāb of Chechnya  himself came to  Tajikistan  for  jihād  and  fought  alongside  various groups there, including those allied with Nuri. Nuri’s group later signed a peace treaty with the communist apostates. The party then became a major member of the tāghūt parliament, thereby apostatizing from Islam.\nLibya\nAbdelhakim  Belhadj  (Abū  ‘Abdillāh  as-Sādiq),  Abdel Wahab  Qaid  (Abū  Idrīs  al-Lībī),  Abdel-Hakim  alHasidi,  Sāmī  Mustafā  as-Sā’idī  (Abul-Mundhir  asSā’idī),  were  all  former  members  of  the  “Libyan Islamic  Fighting  Group”  whose  leadership  was  based in  Afghanistan  before  September  11th  and  whose fighters executed numerous operations in Libya against the tāghūt Gaddafi and his apostate regime. Many of these  leaders  had  once  accompanied  Shaykh  Usāmah Ibn Lādin  in Afghanistan. After the collapse of the Taliban  emirate,  the  leaders  of  the  “Libyan  Fighting Group”  were  captured  by  the  crusaders  and  later handed  over  to  and  released  by  the  crusader  puppet Gaddafi. These former jihād leaders would later join the tāghūt parliament and partake in the shirkī elections after fighting in the war against the tāghūt Gaddafi in “2011.”\nSomalia\nSharif Sheikh Ahmed was the chief commander of the Islamic  Courts  Union  in  “2006.”  During  this  time, he  fought  against  the  tāghūt  Transitional  Federal Government of the Republic of Somalia. After the fall of Mogadishu to the African crusaders and the Somali apostates,  he  fled,  only  to  return  to  Somalia,  run  in its  shirkī  elections,  and  become  its  tāghūt  president, \nThe murtadd Abdelhakim Belhadj\ndabiq\n\fin  which  several  Nusayrī  soldiers  were  killed,  with  the mujāhidīn capturing light, medium, and heavy weapons as ghanīmah.

The inghimāsiyyīn, by  Allah’s  grace,  succeeded  in  killing  everyone  inside the  base,  with  the  number  of  dead  reaching  50.  They then made their way towards another group of Sahwah murtaddīn inside the city, attacking them and detonating their explosive belts in their midst, killing and wounding dozens of them. Amongst those killed were a number of Sahwah leaders, including ‘Abdul-Karīm Ziyād al-Khatīb, Muhammad  Samīr  Haraybilah,  Husayn  Muhammad ‘Abdullāh  Hāfidh,  Yūnus  Sharīf,  Mamdūh  Mustafā ‘Abbās, and Husayn Farrūh.\nWilāyat  Baghdad  –  On  Thursday,  Shawwāl  28,  the soldiers of the Khilāfah detonated a car bomb in the midst of a gathering of Safawī soldiers and Rāfidī Mobilization fighters in one of their strongholds in Sadr City in the eastern  part  of  Baghdad,  killing  approximately  90  of them and wounding 200.\nWilāyat al-Anbār – On Thursday, Dhul-Qa’dah 12, in revenge  for  our  brother  Abū  Rādī  al-Ansārī,  the  amīr of  the  region  of  Jazīrat  al-Khālidiyyah  who  was  killed in  the  battles  in  the  region  of  al-Bū  ‘Īthah,  6  soldiers of the Khilāfah set out with four explosive vehicles and two  medium-caliber  machine  guns  towards  the  main operations base north of ar-Ramādī in the region of atTarrāh located near ath-Tharthār.

Do  not  allow  yourselves to be pawns in the hands of politicians so they can decide whether you live or die!\nAnd remember, it could very easily be you in my place tomorrow!\nI call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up  against  my  real  killers,  the  US  government, for  what  will  happen  to  me  is  only  a  result  of their complacency and criminality.\nMy message to my beloved parents is, save me some  dignity  and  do  not  accept  any  meager compensation for my death from the same people who effectively hit the last nail into my coffin with their recent aerial campaign in Iraq.\nI call on my brother John, who is a part of the US air force, to think about what he’s doing and how his work destroys the lives of many people including that of his own family.\nI call on you John, to think about whoever made the decision to bomb Iraq recently and kill those people,  whoever  they  might  have  been.  Think John. Who is it they really killed? And did they think about me, or you, or our family and how that decision is going to affect us?\nI died on that day John. When your colleagues dropped  those  bombs,  they  signed  my  death certificate!\nI wish I had more time. I wish I could have the hope  of  freedom  and  seeing  my  family  once again. Unfortunately, that boat has sailed.\nNow all I can say is that I wish I were from some other country whose government actually cares about its citizens.\nI guess all in all, I just wish I wasn’t American.\ndabiq\f"
