Allah  \uf063 said,  \u201cRemember  the  blessing  of  Allah  upon  you and His covenant which He made with you, when you  said,  \u2018We  hear  and  we  obey\u2019\u201d  (Al-Maidah  7). \u2018Ubadah Ibn as-Samit \uf068 said, \u201cWe gave bay\u2019ah to the Prophet \uf067, pledging to listen and obey in times of delight and dislike, and in times of hardship and ease, and to do so selflessly; and to not dispute the command of those in authority unless we see blatant kufr, concerning which we have proof from Allah\u201d (Reported  by  al-Bukhari  and  Muslim).  Another narration has \u201cpledging to listen and obey in times of liveliness and laziness.\u201d Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 also said, \u201cListen and obey, even if a slave is appointed over you, leading you with the Book of Allah\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Ummul-Husayn). Ibn Hajar said, concerning the ahadith in this chapter, \u201cThe command  for  obedience  is  regarding  every  emir, whether or not he is the Khalifah\u201d (Fath al-Bari).\nThe  Prophet  \uf067  said,  \u201cI  command  you  with five  things  with  which  Allah  commanded  me:  the Jama\u2019ah, listening, obeying, hijrah, and jihad\u201d (Reported by Ahmad and at-Tirmidhi from al-Harith al-Ash\u2019ari).\nI  would  like  to  stress  here  the  matter  of  being truthful when listening and obeying as well as being serious when following Allah\u2019s orders in times of dislike and hardship, for obedience in that which a person likes is a simple matter, by Allah\u2019s help. The thing we warn of the most is disobedience regarding warfare, as we have seen its consequences more than once, and it has always been a cause for many woes.An example of this is the story of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 with the army of the Sahabah at Uhud. He specified the position of each troop unit, placing the archers in a location from where they could watch their brothers\u2019 backs and defend them from any enemy attempt to encircle them or any potential advance on them. He said to the archers with complete  clarity,  \u201cWatch  our  backs.  If  you  see  us being killed, do not come to support us, and if you see us retrieving ghanimah, do not come to partake in doing so with us.\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from Ibn \u2018Abbas)  But  the  archers  did  not  heed  the  order  of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067, so the outcome was a retreat for the Muslims and a great massacre, all because of a segment of the army disobeyed the sincere order of their commander and his warning to them.\n20Article\nThis shows that military disobedience has a quick result, and any soldier\u2019s lone ijtihad [personal judgment] that opposes the ijtihad of the emir \u2013 even if it apparently seems good and right \u2013 is a big mistake, opening a great door for evil. Instead, the soldier worships Allah by obeying his emir, as long as he does not order him with a shar\u2019i disobedience.As for ijtihad regarding military action, then such is the sole right of the emir, and it is not appropriate for anyone to go against him except by way of giving advice. It is as the precept goes, \u201cThe leader\u2019s opinion, that which concerns his responsibility as leader, is not negated by the opinion of individual Muslims\u201d (Ibn Muflih: Kitab al-Furu\u2019).\nLook, O slave of Allah, at the blessing found in listening and obeying in times of hardship and difficulty. An example of this is when Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 gave orders to the wounded Muslims at Uhud to fight, despite their pains and wounds, when he knew that Abu Sufyan sought to return to finish off those who remained of the Muslim army. The Muslims responded in obedience to Allah and His Messenger [and thus, Abu Sufyan\u2019s plot failed]. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cThose who responded to Allah and the Messenger after injury had struck them, for those who did good among them and feared Allah is a great reward\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 172).\nSuch was their exact condition when they came back from the Battle of al-Ahzab. Though they were looking forward to comfort after their worry was lifted and were enjoying the blessing of security and had not yet shook off the dust from the  lengthy  siege,  the  order  came  for  another  battle  to  be waged at once. \u201cNo one is to pray \u2018Asr except after reaching Bani Quraydhah\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from \nArticle\fnafiqin  and  the  sick-hearted  have  doubt  and,  therefore, mock and attack the promise of Allah and His Messenger \uf067, while the kuffar and tawaghit are deluded by their power and arrogance, \u201cthinking of Allah other than the truth \u2013 the thought of Jahiliyyah\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 154) and the thought of evil, that the Almighty and Wise \uf063 would abandon His religion and His allies, rather, that He would even make His enemies and their word triumph until all the religion is forever for other than Him \u2013 and Allah is exalted far above the thoughts of the ignorant. Rather, Allah is merely luring them forth from where they do not know, such that they work diligently to actualize Allah\u2019s plot and their future punishment, thereby \u201cruining their houses by their [own] hands and the hands of the believers. So take warning, O people of vision\u201d (Al-Hashr 2).\nIn this regard, the cross-worshipers and their allies (the Turks and the Sahwat) mobilized in the northern countryside of Halab, declaring Dabiq their main goal and claiming that if they were to defile it with their filthy feet and banners,  it  would  be  a  tremendous  psychological  victory over the Islamic State, thinking that the soldiers of the Islamic State couldn\u2019t distinguish between the minor battle of Dabiq and the Major Malhamah1 of Dabiq, and accordingly, if the Islamic State were to withdraw from Dabiq, it would not be the bearer of the Prophet\u2019s victorious banner in the major malahim before the Hour, and thus, after the withdrawal, the soldiers of the Khilafah would abandon it in multitudes.\nBut the cross-worshipers and their murtadd allies did not know \u2013 and how could they possibly know \u2013 that the Major Malhamah of Dabiq will be preceded by great events from the minor signs of the Hour, events the believers performing  ribat  in  their  trenches  know.  They  are  events  of which the truthful, trustworthy prophet \uf067 informed in the ahadith of the tribulations, the malahim, and the signs of the Hour.\nThe Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cThe Hour will not be established until the Romans camp in A\u2019maq or Dabiq. An army from the city [or \u2018from Madinah\u2019] \u2013 from among the best people of earth that day \u2013 will head out to them. When they form ranks, the Romans will say, \u2018Leave us and those who were enslaved from amongst us [or \u2018those who enslaved some of our people\u2019] so we can fight them.\u2019 The Muslims will say, \u2018No, by Allah, we will not abandon our brothers to you.\u2019 So they will fight them. Then one third of the army will flee; Allah will never forgive them. One third of them will be killed; they will be the best of the shuhada with Allah. And one third will conquer them; they will never be afflicted with fitnah. Then they will conquer Constantinople. While they are dividing the ghanimah, having hung their swords on olive trees, Shaytan will shout, \u2018The Dajjal has gone after your families!\u2019 So they will leave, but Shaytan\u2019s claim will be false. When they arrive in Sham, the Dajjal will emerge. Then,  as  they  are  preparing  for  battle  and  forming  their ranks, the prayer will be called. So \u2018Isa Ibn Maryam \uf06e will \n1   Malhamah is the singular of malahim, which are the bloody battles that occur before the Hour. They are described in several ahadith of the Prophet \uf067. See, for example, \u201cKitab al-Fitan wa Ashrat asSa\u2019ah\u201d (The Book of Ordeals and the Portents of the Hour) in \u201cSahih Muslim.\u201d\ndescend and lead them. When the enemy of Allah sees him, he will dissolve just as salt dissolves in water. If \u2018Isa were to leave him, the Dajjal would continue to dissolve until perishing, but \u2018Isa himself kills the Dajjal and then shows them his blood on his [\u2018Isa\u2019s] spear\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah).\nYusayr Ibn Jabir reported that Ibn Mas\u2019ud \uf068 said, \u201cIndeed, the Hour will not be established until the people stop dividing inheritance and rejoicing over ghanimah.\u201d Then he said, while pointing towards Sham, \u201cAn enemy will muster strength against the Muslims and the Muslims will muster strength against them.\u201d Yusayr Ibn Jabir asked him, \u201cYou mean the Romans?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, and there will be a severe rout and the Muslims will prepare a detachment to fight to the death and to not return except victorious. They will fight until night intervenes between them; both sides will return without being victorious and the detachment will be wiped out. The Muslims will again prepare a detachment to fight to the death and to not return except victorious. They will fight until night comes upon them; both sides will return without being victorious and the detachment will be wiped out. The Muslims will again prepare a detachment to fight to the death and to not return except victorious. They will fight until night comes upon them; both sides will  return  without  being  victorious  and  the  detachment will be wiped out. When it is the fourth day, the remaining Muslims will rise and advance towards them, and Allah will decree that the enemy be defeated. They will fight a battle the likes of which will never be seen [or \u2018which has never been seen\u2019], such that a bird would pass their flanks and fall down dead before reaching the end of them. [After the battle,] they would count those related to one another and find that after being one hundred relatives in number, only one man among them is left. So what joy would there be in any ghanimah, and what inheritance could be divided? While they are in that state, they will hear of a calamity worse than this, for a cry will reach them that the Dajjal has gone after their families, who were left behind. So they will throw aside what is in their hands and go forth, sending ten horsemen as a vanguard. Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u2018I know their names and the names of their fathers and the colors of their horses. They will be the best [or \u2018amongst the best\u2019] horsemen on the face of the earth that day\u2019\u201d (Reported by Muslim).\nThe Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cCount six things before the Hour: My death, then the conquest of Jerusalem, then a severe death that will afflict you like the disease that afflicts sheep [causing them to die suddenly after their noses run with something], then the spread of wealth to the extent that a man will be given one hundred dinars and will still be angry, then a fitnah which does not leave the home of any Arab except that it enters it, then a truce that will take place between you and the Romans, following which they will betray it and then come to you under eighty banners, with twelve thousand men under each banner\u201d (Reported by alBukhari from \u2018Awf Ibn Malik).\nThe Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cYou will have a treaty of security with the Romans and then you both will fight an enemy beyond [both of] you. You will be victorious, acquire ghanimah, not suffer any losses, settle, and then depart.

These are merely a selection of the numerous operations that the Islamic State has conducted on various fronts across many regions over the course of the last few weeks.\nThe War on Turkey\nOn the 7th of Rabi\u2019 al-Awwal, Abu Anas al-Manbiji and Abu \u2018Umar al-Hashimi \uf08c set out and detonated their explosive vehicles on two groups of Turkish soldiers and Sahwah  fighters  near  the  villages  of  Waqah  and  Kufayr west  of  the  city  of  Bab.  The  operations  resulted  in  one Turkish tank being destroyed and three others being disabled, in addition to a number of murtaddin being killed and  wounded.  This  was  followed  by  the  soldiers  of  the Khilafah carrying out an assault on the village of Kufayr.

Likewise, the mujahidin disabled a Turkish tank near the village of Dana using an explosive device, and also destroyed a 4-wheel drive vehicle with a mortar round.\nOn the 11th of Rabi\u2019 al-Awwal, two istishhadi operations were carried out targeting the murtadd Sahwat and the murtadd Turkish army. The first was carried out by Abu \u2018Abdir-Rahman ash-Shami \uf08a, who detonated his explosive vehicle on a group of them in the village of Azraq west of the city of Bab, killing more than 14 murtaddin and injuring a number of others, in addition to destroying three of their vehicles.

So they ignored the difference of opinion on the issue, turned a blind eye to the evidences, and shed crocodile tears for their apostate brothers \u2013 may Allah gather them together with the burned soldiers of the tawaghit and the dead fighters of the Sahwat in the fire of Jahannam, to abide therein forever.

They treaded this course in issues that have room for differences, doing so to give preference to  the  murtaddin  from  among  the  tawaghit  and the  Sahwat  over  the  mujahid  muwahhidin  from among the muhajirin and the ansar. Indeed, how evil is there judgment!\nAs for them ignoring the difference of opinion on the issue, they did so through their concealment of  what  was  mentioned  by  a  number  of  hadith commentators in statements such as, \u201cThe Salaf differed with respect to burning. \u2018Umar, Ibn \u2018Abbas, and others disliked it\u2026 \u2018Ali, Khalid Ibn al-Walid, and others permitted it\u201d (Ibn Hajar: Fath al-Bari).Likewise, Abu Bakr as-Siddiq and Khalid Ibn al-Walid \uf06b burned some of those who resisted the zakah, as well as some of the followers of the false prophets, and \u2018Ali Ibn Abi Talib \uf068 burned a group of the Rafidah. So they killed murtadd captives \u2013 whose apostasy was of a severe nature \u2013 in the worst of ways in order to terrorize and disperse the remaining murtaddin. Also, Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, \u2018Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Khalid Ibn al-Walid, and \u2018Abdullah Ibn az-Zubayr \uf06a all burned sodomites, doing so \n16Article\nArticle\fThe definition given by the linguistic imams is supported by some weak ahadith attributed to the Prophet \uf067, including, \u201cWage jihad, for it is the monasticism of Islam\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from Abu Sa\u2019id al-Khudri), and, \u201cFor every prophet there is monasticism, and the monasticism of this ummah is jihad for Allah\u2019s cause\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from Anas), and, \u201cWage jihad, for it is the monasticism of my ummah\u201d (Reported by Ibn Hibban from Abu Dharr).\nAlso from among them is a reporting of the hadith of \u2018Uthman Ibn Madh\u2019un, which states he came to the Prophet \uf067 and said, \u201cPermit for me castration,\u201d so Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cHe who either castrates or is castrated is not from us. Indeed, the castration of my ummah is fasting.\u201d Then he said, \u201cO Allah\u2019s Messenger, permit for me siyahah,\u201d so he said, \u201cIndeed, the siyahah of my ummah is jihad for Allah\u2019s cause.\u201d Then he said, \u201cO Allah\u2019s Messenger, permit for me monasticism,\u201d so he said, \u201cIndeed, the monasticism of my ummah is to sit in the masajid while waiting for the prayer\u201d (Reported by Ibnul-Mubarak in az-Zuhd with a weak isnad).\nAlso from among them is, \u201cThere is no siyahah, no tabattul, and no rahbaniyyah [monasticism] in Islam\u201d (Reported by \u2018Abdur-Razzaq from Tawus in mursal form). Ibn Qutaybah said, \u201cWith regards to his statement, \u2018no rahbaniyyah,\u2019 he means the deeds of monks, which entails continuous fasting, the wearing of coarse robes, the abandonment of eating meat, and the likes of such deeds\u2026 And with regards to his statement, \u2018and no tabattul,\u2019 he means the abandonment of marriage\u201d (Gharib al-Hadith).\nIbnul-Anbari said, \u201cA rahib [monk] practicing tabattul is one who is cut off from others in devotion to Allah \uf066 and has abandoned marriage.\u201d He then mentioned the hadith of Tawus, and then said, \u201cRahbaniyyah is to remain in the monasteries and abandon eating meat\u201d (az-Zahir).\nThe definition by the linguistic imams is likewise supported by some of the athar of the Salaf, including, \u201cThe siyahah of this ummah is fasting\u201d (Reported by at-Tabari from \u2018Aishah), and likewise \u201c\u2018As-Saihun\u2019 (At-Tawbah 112)\u2019 are the fasting men,\u201d and \u201c\u2018Saihat\u2019 (At-Tahrim 5) are fasting women\u201d (Both reported by at-Tabari from a number of the Salaf).\nknights of the day, and they are \u201ca multitude from the former peoples and a few from the latter peoples\u201d (Al-Waqi\u2019ah 13-14).\nIbn Qutaybah said, \u201cThe original meaning of \u2018saih\u2019 is one who travels in the land\u2026and the one who is a saih in the land abstains from his desires, so the fasting person was likened to him due to his withholding from food, drink, and intercourse during his fast\u201d (Gharib  al-Quran).\nLikewise, at-Tabari \uf072 stated in his tafsir, \u201cSome of the scholars of the Arabic language would say, \u2018We view that the fasting person was called a saih because the saih has no provisions with him and simply eats wherever he finds food, so it is as if it was taken from that.\u2019\u201d\nAlso from among these athar is the following narration, that Sufyan Ibn \u2018Uyaynah \uf072 said, \u201c\u2018Amr narrated to us that he heard Wahb Ibn Munabbih saying, \u2018Siyahah was present in Bani Israil\u2026\u2019\u201d Ibn \u2018Uyaynah commented, \u201cIf one abandons food, drink, and women, he is a saih\u201d (Reported by at-Tabari).\nLikewise,  al-Marwazi \uf072  (died  294AH)  said,  \u201cIshaq  Ibn  Suwayd [a Tabi\u2019i who died in 131AH] said, \u2018They [meaning the Salaf] viewed  siyahah  to  be  fasting  the  day  and  spending  the  night  in prayer\u2019\u201d  (Mukhtasar  Qiyam  al-Layl).\nAfter all this, it becomes undoubtedly clear that what is intended by \u201cThe sihayah of my ummah is jihad\u201d is the prohibition of the innovated siyahah of monks and what it entails of claiming tawak-\nkul and zuhd by abandoning provisions while traveling and by forsaking marriage, food, meat, and sleep \u2013 and this is a practice that some of the deviant Sufi tariqas inherited from the kafir Jews and Christians. What is also intended by it is guidance to that which is better than the innovated siyahah, to jihad for Allah\u2019s cause and what it entails of striving in worship and in seeking to meet Allah \uf063. This is bearing in mind that some of the Salaf held the alternative to siyahah to be i\u2019tikaf, the night prayer, fasting, or seeking knowledge. Also among them are those who held the alternative to be hijrah, which was paired with jihad in the Quran and the Sunnah. \u2018Abdur-Rahman Ibn Zayd Ibn Aslam \uf072 (died 182AH) stated, concerning the tafsir of Allah\u2019s \uf063 statement, \u201cAs-Saihun,\u201d and His \uf063 statement, \u201cSaihat,\u201d \u201cThere is neither in the Quran nor for the ummah of Muhammad any siyahah except for hijrah\u201d (Reported by at-Tabari). He also said, \u201cTheir siyahah was the hijrah they performed when they made hijrah to Madinah\u201d (Reported by Ibn Abi Hatim).\nTherefore, whoever wishes to be from among those who practice the siyahah of the Sunnah, as understood by the Salaf, must perform hijrah and jihad, must strive against himself for Allah\u2019s sake by adhering to zuhd and dhikr in the course of his ribat and combat as much as he can, and must abandon what Allah dislikes of wrongs and  sins,  both  hidden  and  manifest,  including  pride,  arrogance, backbiting, slander, and fighting for the sake of attaining booty or achieving fame.\nTo conclude, with regards to the tafsir of Allah\u2019s \uf063 statement, \u201cIndeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties [in exchange] for that they will have Jannah. They fight for Allah\u2019s cause, so they kill and are killed. [It is] a true promise [binding]  upon  Him  in  the  Tawrah,  the  Injil,  and  the  Quran. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah? So rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted. And it is that which is the great attainment. [Such believers are] the repentant, the saihun\u2026\u201d (At-Tawbah 111-112), Ibnul-Qayyim \uf072 said, \u201cSiyahah has been interpreted as fasting, and it\u2019s been interpreted as traveling to seek knowledge, and it\u2019s been interpreted as jihad, and it\u2019s been interpreted as adhering to obedience. The reality is that it is the siyahah [journey] of the heart in remembering Allah, loving Him, turning to Him in repentance, and longing to meet Him, and all of the aforementioned deeds follow as a result. For this reason, Allah \uf063 described those new wives who would have replaced the wives of the Prophet \uf067 had he divorced the old ones as being saihat, but their siyahah is neither jihad, nor traveling to seek knowledge, nor continuously fasting. It is but the sihayah of their hearts in loving Allah, fearing Him, turning to Him in repentance, and remembering Him. Consider how Allah \uf063 paired between repentance and worship. The first is to abandon what He dislikes, and the second is to do what He loves. Likewise, hamd [praise] and siyahah are paired together. The first is to praise Him with His attributes of perfection and with the siyahah of the tongue in the best of His dhikr, and the second is the siyahah of the heart in loving Him, remembering Him, and venerating Him, just as Allah \uf063 paired between worship and siyahah in the description of the wives, for the first is to worship Him by the limbs and the second is to worship Him by the heart\u201d (Hadi al-Arwah).\nAllah knows best.

Thereafter, new centers of power took shape within the movement, and the reins of power were taken with support and direction from Pakistani  Intelligence.\nThis  murtadd  faction  in  whose  hands  was  the portfolio for external relations since the movements\u2019 seizure of Kabul \u2013 and which was in charge of every flattering address directed towards the mushrikin and murtaddin in the neighboring countries \u2013 increased in their allegiance to the kuffar after they took control of the entire affair, and they began to offer themselves to them as a humble servant and a watch dog guarding \ntheir borders and their lands by constantly reaffirming that they do permit the mujahidin to prepare new attacks against them that are launched from the areas that they control, and this was in exchange for attaining  the  mushrikin\u2019s  recognition,  their  acceptance  in establishing relations with them, and their contribution of some support to them.\nAnd with the announcement of the Islamic State and the return of the rule of the Khilafah on the earth, and  the  rebuilding  of  the  jama\u2019ah  of  the  Muslims, and  the  endeavor  to  establish  the  shari\u2019ah  of  Allah on the entire earth, the murtadd nationalist Taliban movement shared with the Crusader nations and the tawaghit who rule the lands of the Muslims their fear of the spread of the call to tawhid among the people, as well as its implications, including the obligation of disavowal from shirk and its people, showing hostility to them, and fighting them until the religion is entirely for Allah, and likewise what it implied of loyalty to the people of Islam, and the obligation of their adhering to the jama\u2019ah of the Muslims, and breaking the artificial borders that are tearing apart and separating the Muslim lands, and the disbandment of organizations and factions who divide the Muslims into groups and parties. \nFighting  the  Islamic  State  ultimately  became  a \n42ARTICLE\nARTICLE\f", "schema:headline": "The Murtadd Taliban Movement", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "41"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah1-The-Religion-of-Islam-and-the-Jama\u2019ah-of-the-Muslims", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "1", "schema:articleBody": "Indeed, all praise is due to Allah. We praise Him and seek His help. Whomsoever Allah guides there is none to misguide, and whomsoever Allah leaves to stray there is none to guide. I testify that there is no god except Allah alone, who has no partner, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger \uf067. As for what follows:\nThe purpose of this series is to clarify the reality of Islam and the necessity of the Jama\u2019ah. We ask Allah to grant both us and you understanding of Islam and to keep us firm in the Jama\u2019ah of the Muslims.\nAllah \uf065 said, \u201cThis day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved Islam as the religion for you\u201d (Al-Maidah 3). He \uf065 also said, \u201cIndeed, the religion with Allah is Islam\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 19). He \uf065 also said, \u201cAnd whoever desires other than Islam as a religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 85).\nThus, the religion which Allah is pleased with for the people  and  other  than  which  He  does  not  accept  from them is Islam. Its reality, both linguistically and religiously, is: salamah, meaning ikhlas, and istislam to Allah, meaning submission to Him.\nAbul-\u2018Abbas Ibn Taymiyyah \uf072 said, \u201cIslam is to submit to Allah alone, and the term Islam encompasses istislam (submission) as well as having ikhlas (sincerity) in this istislam to Allah \u2026 So whoever does not submit to Him is not a Muslim, and whoever submits to other than Him the same as he submits to Him is not a Muslim, and whoever submits to Him alone is a Muslim, as in the Quran, \u2018Yes [on the contrary], whoever submits his face in Islam to Allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve\u2019 (Al-Baqarah 112). He also said, \u2018And who is better in religion than one who submits himself to Allah while being a doer of good and follows the religion of Ibrahim, inclining toward truth? And Allah took Ibrahim as an intimate friend\u2019 (An-Nisa 125)\u201d (An-Nubuwwat).\n4\flishing Allah\u2019s law among the people, implementing the hudud,  and  holding  the  people  back  from  committing transgression, they are prevented from doing injustice to one  another.  Within  this  framework,  the  Islamic  State established various bodies responsible for preventing the people from wronging one another and for eliminating injustice when it occurs from any individual or any party, and from among these bodies is the Central Office for Investigating  Grievances.\nQuestion:  What are the other bodies in the Islamic State that oversee the prevention of wrongdoing and the elimination of injustice among the people?\nAnswer: The basic principle concerning this matter is that supporting one who has been wronged and taking the wrongdoer to account \u2013 even if he is a Muslim \u2013 is a crucial duty compulsory on every Muslim, as the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cCome to your brother\u2019s aid whether he is the wronged one or the wrongdoer.\u201d A man asked, \u201cO Messenger of Allah, I will come to his aid if he is wronged, but if he is the wrongdoer how can I come to his aid?\u201d He said, \u201cBy obstructing him or preventing him from doing injustice, for to do so is to come to his aid\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Anas). This duty becomes even more compulsory when it comes to the soldiers of the Islamic State,  given  the  trust  which  the  leaders  have  burdened them to carry in this regard. The duty of the soldiers is in assisting their brothers in doing their job, those brothers who\u2019ve been tasked with investigating grievances.\nDue to the importance of preventing injustice, it\u2019s become necessary for there to be designated bodies tasked solely with handling this issue. As such, the Islamic State \u2013 by Allah\u2019s grace alone \u2013 established offices for grievances which fall under the Diwan of Judgment and Grievances, as well as offices for grievances in all the wilayat of the Islamic State which are under the direct administration of the offices of the wulat (plural of wali) such that the cases connected to the soldiers and leaders under the wali\u2019s authority will reach them. Likewise, the Central Office for Investigating Grievances was established as an independent body specifically tasked with handling this issue. All of these bodies work together to investigate cases in which there is a sense of injustice, and to continue following up on them until the injustice \u2013 if it exists \u2013 is eliminated.\nQuestion:  What  is  the  purpose  of  having  multiple \nbodies  for  tracking  cases  of  injustice?\nAnswer: The Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cEvery one of you is a shepherd and every one of you is responsible for his flock\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar). It is obligatory on anyone who has been entrusted by Allah \nwith  anything  of  the  affairs  of  the  Muslims  to  prevent those he is responsible for from suffering injustice, and if it reaches him that this has occurred, he must endeavor to remove the injustice from them.\nFor this reason, there are multiple bodies in the Islamic State responsible for eliminating injustice, such that the subjects and soldiers of the Islamic State in the wilayat are able to lodge complaints with the wulat against the soldiers and leaders under their authority, and that people who have cases in the courts are able to lodge complaints with the Diwan of Judgment against the judges\u2019 rulings so that their rulings can be reviewed, and that the Muslims in general who are residing in Dar al-Islam can lodge complaints  against  the  wulat  themselves  or  against  the heads of the dawawin and the military leaders, or lodge complaints  about  the  administrative  procedures  in  the various dawawin with the Delegated Committee, which is the body that has tasked the Central Office for Investigating Grievances with this mission.\nIn  this  manner,  we  would  have  \u2013  by  Allah\u2019s  permission  \u2013  made  effort  to  open  the  door  for  the  people  to put forth their grievances against any individual or body in the Islamic State, and removed any factors preventing their cases from being resolved under the pretext that the body with whom cases are lodged is not responsible for investigating them, or that no one has any power over the accused  party.\nQuestion: What are the procedures the office follows \nwhen tracking cases that have been referred to it?\nAnswer: Once we\u2019ve received a case and registered it, if there is a sense that injustice might have occurred in the case based on the complainant\u2019s claims, we investigate the case, otherwise we dismiss it immediately.\nThe  case  is  then  examined,  and  if  it  has  to  do  with someone under the authority of the wulat or the heads of the dawawin, it is transferred to them to investigate and report the results of the investigation to the office so they can re-assess the case. If the investigation meets all the  requirements  and  the  judgment  is  appropriate,  the judgment is then validated, and if the investigation is deficient or the judgment in the case is inappropriate, it is transferred back to them for re-examination and our role at this point is to track the case on a continuous basis to ensure that it is re-examined and quickly resolved.\nIf, however, the case has to do with one of the wulat or one of the heads of the dawawin, or is against one of the Islamic State\u2019s departments, we take up the matter and summon the accused or one of their representatives in order to investigate the case and listen to their defense con-\n\f", "schema:headline": "The Religion of Islam and the Jama\u2019ah of the Muslims", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5-Paths-to-Victory:-Part-3", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "5", "schema:articleBody": "The  fifth  path  to  victory  is  preparation. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cPrepare for them whatever you can of strength\u201d (Al-Anfal 60). The author of \u201cAdwa al-Bayan\u201d said, \u201cThis is a decisive order for preparing as much strength as possible, no matter  how  advanced  the  means  of  strength become.  Thus,  this  is  a  decisive  order  to adjust with the development of worldly affairs in this regards.\u201d\nIt  is  known  that  waging  jihad  today  is fard \u2018ayn upon every Muslim. And whatever is  required  for  an  obligation  to  be  fulfilled is  itself  an  obligation.  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  \uf067 said, \u201cShoot, O Bani Isma\u2019il, for indeed your father was a shooter\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Salamah Ibn al-Akwa\u2019). And he \uf067 said, \u201cIndeed  strength  is  shooting\u201d  (Reported  by Muslim from \u2018Uqbah Ibn \u2018Amir). As-San\u2019ani said in his commentary on the previous hadith, \u201cThis hadith explains the \u2018strength\u2019 mentioned in the ayah, that it means \u2018shooting arrows,\u2019 as that is what was customary during the life of  the  Prophet.  This  includes  shooting  rifles against the mushrikin and the bughat\u201d (Subul as-Salam). In short, making preparations for the  current  battle  against  the  Crusader  and murtadd enemies is an obligation upon every Muslim who is obliged to perform jihad.\nHere, I will mention some points:First  is  what  Abu  Ja\u2019far  at-Tabari  \uf072 mentioned  in  his  tafsir  of  His  \uf063  saying, \u201cWhatever  you  can  of  strength.\u201d  He  said, \u201cWhat you are capable of preparing for them of weaponry that will be a means of strength for  you  against  them\u201d  (Jami\u2019  al-Bayan). Accordingly, producing weapons is one of the greatest aids to waging jihad for Allah\u2019s cause. Today,  this  production  is  called  the  \u201cwar industry.\u201d  Allah  mentioned  this  industry  in more than one place in His book. Indeed, He was very precise when He \uf063 said, \u201cWe taught him  the  making  of  labus  for  you,  to  fortify you against your [enemy in] war. So will you be  grateful?\u201d  (Al-Anbiya  80).  At-Tabari  \uf072 said, \u201cLabus, according to the Arabs, is every \nform of arms, be it a coat of armor, breastplate, sword, or spear.\u201d  Ibn  Kathir  said,  \u201c[Allah  taught  him]  how  to  make coats  of  armor.\u201d\nThe Lord of might mentioned the description of armor, saying,  \u201cMake  full  coats  of  mail,  and  measure  the  links\u201d (Saba 11), meaning long and wide coats of armor. As for, \u201cAnd  measure  the  links,\u201d  the  author  of  \u201cAdwa  al-Bayan\u201d said, \u201cMeaning make the links and nails, when producing coats  of  mail,  using  appropriate  measures.\u201d\nIbn  Kathir  reported  from  Qatadah  that  coats  of  armor used to be smooth, like sheets, and Dawud was the first to make them with links.\nThis  shows  the  divine  attention  given  regarding  the manufacturing of armor, to the point that Allah mentioned its finer details and then reminded His slaves of this great favor, saying, \u201cSo will you be grateful?\u201d Unfortunately, many of the mujahidin, if not most of them, are unconcerned with this  in  our  war  against  our  enemy.  This,  despite  its  many benefits,  the  most  significant  being  the  protection  of  the mujahid\u2019s life \u2013 which is the dearest thing to us \u2013 against enemy  bullets  and  bomb  fragments.\nA  second  benefit  is  the  securing  of  the  mujahid  from being  injured  in  critical  areas,  which  would  hinder  him from continuing the jihad or make him lose consciousness, thus remaining on the battlefield thereafter, exposing him to being  taken  prisoner  by  the  enemies.\nA  third  benefit  is  that  the  mujahid  is  thereby  aided  in reaching  the  points  closest  to  the  enemy.  This  especially applies  to  the  heroes  who  storm  enemy  positions  and  the lions  of  istishhadi  operations.\nArticle\fcorruption (and even issuing fatawa permitting shirk for the sake of some so-called benefit), many people then believed in the tawaghit, became their allies, entered their religion, and even became their soldiers. The reason for this apostasy was that the evil \u201cscholars\u201d concealed the truth and mixed it with falsehood.\nIn this regards, one who looks to the Arabian Peninsula will find that the Saudi tawaghit did not dare to manifest much of their kufr and corruption and were not followed in apostasy by a party of the people except due to the committee of senior agents,2 Ibn Baz, Ibn \u2018Uthaymin, al-Fawzan, the contemporary Al ash-Shaykh, and their likes. This was due to these \u201cscholars\u201d concealing the truth and not clarifying the condition of Al Salul to the people. Rather, they added to the deception by describing them as \u201cwulat al-amr\u201d (people of authority) and claimed that they were the rightful rulers!Likewise, they concealed from the people the ruling on the taghuti legislative decrees, the ruling on establishing Crusader military bases in the land, and the ruling on permitting riba. As a result, many people foolishly followed the tawaghit, deviating and apostatizing thereby. These \u201cscholars\u201d therefore have a share in the evils committed by those who have followed them, without the evils of those followers diminishing at all.\nThis is the same case in Egypt, as the reason for the people\u2019s deviance and their following of Hosni Mubarak and Sisi thereafter is the \u201cscholars\u201d of al-Azhar and the claimants to Salafiyyah. Likewise, the reason for the people entering into the shirk of parliaments and elections is the tawaghit of the Murtadd Brotherhood and the Party of Darkness.3 We find this scenario repeated in all other lands.\nAltering and Distorting the Law\nFrom among the traits of the evil \u201cscholars\u201d is that they alter and distort the law \u2013 if they are unable to completely conceal it \u2013 by giving corrupt interpretations of the shar\u2019i texts and diverting theses texts from their true meanings to false meanings, just as Allah \uf063 said about the Jews, \u201c[They] distort words from their [proper] usages\u201d (An-Nisa 46). They then attribute their distortions and false interpretations to Allah \uf063, just as the Jews did before them; Allah \uf063 said, \u201cIndeed, there is among them a party who alter the Scripture with their tongues so you may think it is from the Scripture, but it is not from the Scripture. And they say, \u2018This is from Allah,\u2019 but it is not from Allah. And they speak lies about Allah while they know\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 78).\nAs to the shar\u2019i texts ordering jihad, the evil \u201cscholars\u201d persisted in changing their combat-related meaning to other meanings, in order to divert people from fighting the kuffar and the murtaddin. On top of that, they innovated meanings for jihad, meanings for which Allah had not sent down any authority and which even contradict the reality of jihad, such as their claim that jihad is to enlist in the armies of the tawaghit, or to engage in the shirki democratic process in order to compete with the secularists in claiming for oneself Al-\n2   A reference to the apostate \u201cCommittee of Senior Scholars\u201d in so-called  \u201cSaudi  Arabia.\u201d\n3    A reference to the apostate \u201cHizb an-Nur\u201d party in Egypt.\nOne of the taghut \u201cscholars\u201d waiting to be slaughtered \nlah\u2019s right to rule and legislate, or to do other deeds that take one out of the religion, deeds which these cursed \u201cscholars\u201d attempt to associate with the pinnacle of Islam, jihad.\nLikewise, with respect to the shar\u2019i texts that contain the order to openly declare the truth, the evil \u201cscholars\u201d have resorted to nullifying them and not abiding by them, claiming that Allah commands so! They used as evidence His \uf063 statement, \u201cDo not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction\u201d (Al-Baqarah 195). This is despite the fact that what is intended by \u201cdestruction\u201d is the abandonment of jihad, as the companion Abu Ayyub al-Ansari \uf068 clarified when he said, \u201cThrowing ourselves into destruction is by attending to our wealth, amending it, and abandoning jihad\u201d (Reported by Abu Dawud). Thus, how ugly the evil \u201cscholars\u201d are and how ugly their deception is!\nAverting People from Allah\u2019s Path\nIndeed, the evil \u201cscholar,\u201d by treading the path of deviance, fervently endeavors to swerve the people onto his path and avert them from the path of truth, since he fears that his deeds would contradict his statements if he were to manifest the shar\u2019i texts for the people without deception and deceit. He resorts to distortion and to twisting the meanings of the texts so that the matter can be in accordance with his condition and in agreement with his desires. For this reason, you find him averting the youth from jihad, because he inclines towards  the  Dunya  and  is  afflicted  with  the  condition  of sitting back from jihad. And because he is afraid of openly declaring the truth, you see him dressing the truth with falsehood, making this the basis of his da\u2019wah, and claiming it to be the essence of \u201cwisdom\u201d and \u201ccunning.\u201d So he neither manifests the truth nor suffices in concealing it. Rather, he deceives, distorts, dodges, and deludes, and speaks about Allah without knowledge, in order to avert people from Allah\u2019s \n\f", "schema:headline": "Paths to Victory: Part 3", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "21"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah7", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah6", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah6-Examples-of-the-Sahaba's-Eagerness-to-Attain-Shahadah", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "6", "schema:articleBody": "The first forerunners from among the Muhajirin and the Ansar knew that Jannah was Allah\u2019s precious commodity,  and  also  knew  that  none  would  be  able  to pay its price except one who rolled up his sleeves for difficult work. So they searched for every path to Allah\u2019s pleasure so that they could attain it, while asking Allah for facilitation and acceptance.\nThus, you would see them resolving to engage in trade with Allah, selling their lives and wealth so that He would purchase them. \u201cO you who have believed, shall I guide you to a transaction that will save you from  a  painful  punishment?

However, he swore an oath and made a promise, so let us listen to his nephew Anas Ibn Malik as he tells us about his uncle\u2019s deed. He said, \u201cMy uncle, Anas Ibn an-Nadr, was absent from the fight-\ning at Badr, so he said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, I was absent from the first battle in which you fought the mushrikin. If Allah allows me to attend a battle against the mushrikin, Allah will certainly see what I will do!\u2019 Then, when the day of Uhud came and the Muslims became exposed, he said, \u2018O Allah, I ask Your pardon for what these ones (i.e. the Sahabah) have done, and I absolve myself before You of what these ones (i.e. the  mushrikin)  have  done.\u2019  He  then  advanced  and was met by Sa\u2019d Ibn Mu\u2019adh, so he said, \u2018O Sa\u2019d Ibn Mu\u2019adh, it is Jannah, by the Lord of an-Nadr! Indeed, I smell its fragrance before Uhud.\u2019 Sa\u2019d said, \u2018But I was not able, O Messenger of Allah, to do what he did.\u2019\u201d Anas said, \u201cWe found on him eighty some-odd sword wounds,  spear  wounds,  and  arrow  wounds,  and  we found that he had been killed and the mushrikin had mutilated him, so no one recognized him except for his sister, through his fingertips.\u201d Anas then said, \u201cWe would view or think that this ayah was revealed about him and his likes: \u2018Among the believers are men true to what they promised Allah\u2019 (Al-Ahzab 23).\u201d\n\u2018Umayr Ibn al-Hammam \uf068 Races to a Garden as \nWide as the Heavens and Earth\nAnd here we have Anas \uf068 telling us about their endeavor.

A soldier of the Khilafah had carried out a Just Terror operation, striking Manchester Arena at the conclusion of a concert by an American singer. The explosion rocked the city and filled its residents with terror as many of them scrambled to try to contact their loved ones and ensure that they were safe. Then, the casualty figures started emerging: More than 20 had been killed and dozens more had been wounded. The total would later climb to nearly 100 dead and wounded.\nIn  the  wake  of  the  bombing,  the  panic-ridden friends and relatives took to social media to enlist the help of strangers in the search for their loved ones, local pubs began offering free booze to emergency personnel in need of clearing their minds of the traumatic scenes they had witnessed, British \u201cMuslims\u201d came out and offered their token denunciations out of fear of retaliation, massive numbers of police and military personnel were deployed on the streets, the UK threat level was raised to \u201cCritical,\u201d Politicians brought their campaigning  for  the  upcoming  general  elections  to  a  halt,  the distraught  and  \u201cbroken\u201d  American  singer  placed  her European tour on hold and went home, and the Chelsea FC football team cancelled their victory parade in London. The enemies of Islam did their best to put on a brave and defiant face, but their efforts were a complete failure. They were clearly suffering.\nOn the surface, the operation in Manchester seemed to confirm what so many analysts had been asserting for  some  time  now:  that  with  the  loss  of  territory  in Iraq and Sham, the Islamic State would shift its focus towards carrying out attacks on Crusader soil. What many of these analysts failed to admit, however, is that losing territory was nothing new for the Islamic State. The loss of most of its territory in the wake of the Sahwah initiative in Iraq did not lead to its defeat. Rather, it only led to the Islamic State regrouping, redoubling its efforts, rekindling the flames of war, recapturing every inch of territory it had lost, and expanding into Sham, Sinai, Khurasan, and multiple other regions around the world, regions where no one would have expected that the mujahidin would take control and establish the rule \nof Allah.\nSo  it  came  as  no  surprise  when,  several  thousand miles from Manchester, the soldiers of the Khilafah in East Asia stormed the city of Marawi in the southern Philippines on the island of Mindanao, chased out the local police and the military, and raised the banner of the Islamic State in a scene reminiscent of the liberation of Mosul from the Rafidi murtaddin and their Crusader allies. The victory came several weeks after Rodrigo Duterte, the Crusader taghut of the Philippines, admitted that the situation in the southern part of the Philippines was giving him a headache and making him lose sleep.\nThis taghut came into power believing that he had the  ability  to  negotiate  with  the  \u201cIslamist  militants\u201d in the southern region of the Philippines, particularly those in his own homeland of Mindanao, in the hopes of  bringing  an  end  to  their  jihad  and  subsequently expelling  the  American  forces  present  in  the  Philippines. But when the soldiers of the Khilafah repeatedly demonstrated to him that they only negotiate with their enemies using bullets and bombs, he was reduced to begging the mayors governing the Muslim areas in the southern part of the country to help him deal with the mujahidin, while simultaneously threatening to impose martial law in their areas if the problem wasn\u2019t tackled. Then, when the soldiers of the Khilafah stormed the city of Marawi, he held to his promise and imposed martial law, sending in his military to try to regain control of the city, with the mujahidin subsequently massacring dozens of his Crusader soldiers and kindling a new front in their war against kufr.\nThe reality faced by the Crusaders today is that despite their claims that the Islamic State has been weakened,  the  mujahidin\u2019s  ousting  of  the  Crusaders  and their  puppets  and  their  attainment  of  consolidation in the land can come as quickly and unexpectedly in any region of the earth, just as they did previously in Mosul, and their strikes in the heart of the Crusaders\u2019 strongholds in the West will continue to occur just as suddenly and unexpectedly as occurred in Manchester. For just as Allah c expelled the disbelieving Crusaders at their first gathering and mobilization in Iraq, it is He who will expel them from the lands of the Muslims in the Philippines and cast terror into their hearts in their own strongholds in the West.\n\u201cAnd Allah prevails over His affair, but most of the \npeople do not know\u201d (Yusuf 21).\nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Front Cover", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "0"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5-Leaders-of-the-Murabit-Emirate", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "5", "schema:articleBody": "The Reviver of the Shari\u2019ah in the Lands of the Sahara\n\u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin\nFrom the established ways of Allah \uf062 concerning His creation is that whenever people stray from the right path, He sends someone to them who will revive the matter of their religion. Some of the people will obey him, but most of them will oppose him. The muwahhidin will show their rejection of whoever opposes the methodology of Allah \uf062 and they will fight them with the sword until Allah makes His religion manifest, so that religion \u2013 in its entirety \u2013 shall be His. From amongst these revivers was the caller, the scholar, the mujahid \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin \uf072.\nHis story began when Yahya Ibn Ibrahim, the shaykh of the Kadalah tribe, which resided in the Maghrib desert, took him to teach his people about the Shari\u2019ah of Allah and His hudud. He was a good man who loved the religion, and he had been in search of someone who would go with him to call his people, but many of the du\u2019at refused to go with him to the desert due to the hardship it entailed, except for the teacher and mujahid \u2013 \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin \u2013 who accepted the mission and sought Allah\u2019s aid to complete it.\nAs-Salawi said, \u201cOne of their men undertook the assignment. He was called \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin al-Juzuli. Participating in several sciences, he was a clever student and possessed merit, religiosity, piety, and good politics\u201d (Al-Istiqsa). And so, Ibn Yasin endured remoteness and traveled into the \nheart of the Sahara, carrying the religion to a people who had strayed from it.\nWhen  \u2018Abdullah  Ibn  Yasin  arrived  at  the  camping grounds of the Lamtunah tribe, and they asked him what he had brought to them, he told them about the Shari\u2019ah of Islam, which he had come to teach to them and whose hudud he had come to apply. Ibnul-Athir said, \u201cThey said, \u2018Recall for us the Shari\u2019ah of Islam.\u2019 So he taught them the creed and obligations of Islam. They said, \u2018As for what you mentioned of prayer and zakah, then this is close [to what we accept]. As for your saying that whoever kills is to be killed, whoever steals is to [have his hand] cut off, and whoever fornicates is to be lashed or stoned to death, then this is something by which we will not abide. Go to someone else.\u2019 So both of them left\u201d (Al-Kamil fit-Tarikh). And thus, this apostate tribe initially resisted abiding by the Shari\u2019ah and Ibn Yasin refused to remain with them as long as they did not accept the Shari\u2019ah in its entirety.\nIbn Yasin pressed on to the tribe of Kadalah in the company of its shaykh. Ibnul-Athir said, \u201cSo \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin called them and those tribes neighboring them to the rule of Shari\u2019ah. Some of them obeyed, while others abstained and disobeyed.\u201d When the tribe lost patience with abiding by the Shari\u2019ah, refusing to submit to it, they compelled him to leave them. Since Ibn Yasin had no power, at that time, to wage war against them, he resolved to go to the Sudan for the \nArticle\fto eradicate \u201cLa ilaha illallah\u201d from the earth. But it is impossible for him to do so, as the Ummah of Muhammad \uf067 is a fertile ummah \u2013 not a barren one \u2013 and it will remain so until Allah inherits the earth and all that is upon it.\nHowever, some women might not comprehend the enemy\u2019s policy in their war against the muwahhidin, nor do they appreciate that with the birth of every newborn Muslim, a thorn is planted into the throat of kufr and a dagger is stabbed into the flank of shirk. Nor do these women realize that by increasing the number of Muslims, the despicable are suffocated and the banners of the kuffar are lowered, just as the voices of the righteous are raised.\nAs for the policy of birth control, it is a disease that was injected into our fertile ummah by the enemy in order to decrease the Muslim population and weaken its strength. The Prophet \uf067 ordered to increase the Muslims\u2019 numbers, as Ma\u2019qil Ibn Yasar said, \u201cA man came to the Prophet \uf067 and said, \u2018I have found a woman who is both noble in lineage and beautiful, but she is barren. Should I marry her?\u2019 He said, \u2018No.\u2019 A second man came to him [with the same question], so he forbade him. Then a third man came to him, so he said, \u2018Marry the affectionate woman who is fertile, for I will outnumber the [other] nations through you\u2019\u201d (Reported by Abu Dawud and Ibn Hibban).\nLikewise, the Prophet \uf067 supplicated for Anas Ibn Malik \uf068 to have many children and to be blessed with them, saying, \u201cO Allah, increase his wealth and children, and bless him through what You have given him\u201d (Reported by alBukhari and Muslim). Anas later said, \u201cMy daughter told me that more than 120 of my progeny were buried, and I am the wealthiest of the Ansar\u201d (Reported by Ahmad).\nAl-Ahnaf Ibn Qays entered upon Mu\u2019awiyah \uf068, who was looking at his son Yazid in front of him admiringly and then said, \u201cO Abu Bahr, what do you say about children?\u201d He replied, \u201cThey are the support for our backs, the fruit of our hearts, and the coolness of our eyes. We attack our enemies with them and they are what is left of us after we die. Thus, be to them as if you are a humble earth and shading sky. If they ask of you, then give to them. If they require admonition, then admonish them. Do not refrain from being generous to them, lest they become bored of your company, dislike your life, and long for your death.\u201d Mu\u2019awiyah said, \u201cMay Allah bless you, O Abu Bahr. They are just as you have described\u201d (Amali al-Qali).\nLikewise, we will not miss this opportunity to warn every Muslim sister of another evil policy of Islam\u2019s enemies, which is to delay marriage until a later age. This is part of the kafir plot to turn Muslimat away from their true role in life, that they were created for the tawhid of Allah \uf062 and worshiping only Him and no one else and then for serving the religion by what Allah made easy for them, including marriage, bearing children, and raising them.\nIf  only  the  Muslimah  knew  the  benefits  of  marrying early, along with the intention to increase the population and produce righteous children who will be dutiful to her and supplicate for her and their father even after both of them die! Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cWhen a person dies, his deeds shall cease except for three: a continuous charity, beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who supplicates for him\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah).\nHe \uf067 also said, \u201cIndeed, Allah \uf062 will raise the righteous slave\u2019s rank in Jannah, so he will say, \u2018My Lord, what have I done to receive this?\u2019 He will say, \u2018It is due to your child asking forgiveness for you\u2019\u201d (Reported by Ahmad and Ibn Majah from Abu Hurayrah).\nIn his sahih, al-Bukhari titled a chapter as \u201cChapter: He Who Produces Children for Jihad,\u201d and then reported from Abu Hurayrah \uf068 that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cSulayman Ibn Dawud \uf071 said, \u2018Tonight, I will visit one-hundred women \u2013 or ninety-nine \u2013 and each of them will produce a knight who will wage jihad for Allah\u2019s cause.\u2019 His companion said to him, \u2018Inshaallah.\u2019 But he did not say, \u2018Inshaallah.\u2019 So none of them became pregnant except one woman, who gave birth to half a child. By Him in whose hand is my soul, if he had said, \u2018Inshaallah,\u2019 they would have all been knights waging jihad for Allah\u2019s cause.\u201d\nIf the Muslimah knew how much support for the religion and aggravation for the kuffar is found therein, she would change her former attitude forever, in order to be from those who \u201cdo not take a step that aggravates the kuffar or do anything that harms an enemy, except that a righteous deed is written for them\u201d (At-Tawbah 120).\nThe Muslimah should reflect over the saying of \u2018Umar \uf068, \u201cBy Allah, I force myself to have intercourse, hoping that Allah will bring forth from my loins someone who will praise Allah\u201d (Reported by al-Bayhaqi in al-Kubra).\nAlso, marrying off one\u2019s daughters at what is known as a \u201cyoung age\u201d is considered a punishable crime according to the taghut laws of some so-called \u201cIslamic\u201d countries. As for the Shari\u2019ah of Islam, then nothing is halal except what Allah \uf063 has permitted, and nothing is haram except what Allah has forbidden. Indeed, \u2018Aishah \uf069 said, \u201cThe Prophet \uf067 married me when I was 6 years old. Then, we came to Madinah and stayed with Bani al-Harith Ibn Khazraj. I became ill and my hair started to fall out. When it grew to about shoulder length, my mother Umm Ruman came to me while I was playing with some of my friends on a swing. She called out to me, so I came to her, not knowing what she wanted with me. She then took my hand until she stopped me at the door of the house. I was breathing heavily until my breathing settled a bit. She then took some water and wiped my face and head with it. Then, she brought me into the house, where women from the Ansar were gathered, and they said, \u2018For wellness and blessing and good!\u2019 So she gave me to them and they fixed me up. I was not startled by any of this until Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 came at midmorning. She then gave me to him, and I was \u2013 on that day \u2013 9 years old\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).Once the Muslim sister knows this, she will cast anything contrary to it aside, devote herself to increasing the Ummah  in  lions  and  preparing  them,  making  a  den  for them out of her house, wherein she nourishes them with tawhid and wala and bara, until she opens the den\u2019s door for them, after their hearts have become \u201csevere against the disbelievers and merciful to one another\u201d (Al-Fath 29), and \u201chumble to the believers, mighty against the disbelievers, waging jihad for Allah\u2019s cause and not fearing the blame of any blamer\u201d (Al-Maidah 54). And our final call is that all praise belongs to Allah, Lord of the creation.\n\f", "schema:headline": "Leaders of the Murabit Emirate", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "29"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah11-Contents", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "S\nT\nISSUE 11 - SHAWWAL 1438\nO MUWAHHIDIN, REJOICE, FOR BY ALLAH, WE WILL NOT REST FROM OUR JIHAD EXCEPT BENEATH THE OLIVE TREES OF RUMIYAH (ROME).

They neither accepted disgrace in their religion, nor did they surrender to their enemy, and they did not retreat from a piece of land except that they filled it with the torn limbs of the mushrikin and their blood, in order that they may not rejoice over their advances, nor celebrate an easy victory. And thus is the way of the  people  of  tawhid  everywhere,  and  the  stories  of their steadfastness and heroism in fighting are nothing strange. Here are the epic battles of Sirte, Fallujah, Bab, and other than them from among their timeless battles,  bearing  witness  to  the  truthfulness  of  their words, and the goodness of their deeds. \u201cAnd whoever is an ally of Allah and His Messenger and those who have believed - indeed, the party of Allah - they will be the predominant\u201d (Al-Maidah 56).\nAnd today is the day for the people of tawhid and the soldiers of the Khilafah in the city of Raqqah to compete with their brothers in pursuing the pleasure of the Lord of the creation, and in pursuit of the highest degrees of Jannah, whereby they cling tightly to their posts with their molars, and sacrifice their lives for the cause of their religion, remaining true to what they promised Allah, each one of them declaring in his position: Allah \uf063 shall see what I do today. And so they confront their enemies on the frontlines, not turning their faces away during the confrontation, until they meet their Lord, for He \uf063 has laughed and is pleased with them.\nFor the murtaddin have come to them with fear and apprehension, as they know for certain that this battle is not like any other battle that has preceded it and  in  which  they  engaged  with  the  soldiers  of  the Khilafah, and because of this they prepared for it that which they had not prepared for previous instances, and  they  mustered  for  it  soldiers  the  likes  of  which they had never done before, and the Crusaders presented them with support the likes of which they had never  done  before,  and  the  Crusader  leadership  still continue to remind them that this battle will not be easy, and that it won\u2019t be ended any time soon, preparing them mentally to continue forward regardless of whatever losses are incurred and however long it takes.However, the Crusaders and their murtadd allies know with certainty that there is not an army in the \nworld that is able to continue in a battle whose losses are greater than its ability to compensate, and whose duration is longer than its strength to hold out and persist,  and  if  that  weren\u2019t  the  case,  the  Crusader American  army  wouldn\u2019t  have  felt  compelled  to  retreat, leaving Iraq defeated and expelled after what it encountered at the hands of the mujahidin, and due to what its leaders recognized of the huge magnitude of exhaustion that had afflicted it, and which began to threaten their entire country, through its economy which was struck by the crisis, and its prestige which had reached rock bottom, and its strategy which was forced to be changed due to its high costs.\nFrom the greatest causes of fear that the Crusaders and their murtadd allies have is that they know very well the size of their forces, and they realize that the PKK and their small numbers, and the burdensome expenses on the Crusader treasury involved in arming them, and their murtadd soldiers whom they apprehend  from  the  streets  and  after  some  poor  training hurl them into the battle fronts, are not capable \u2013 by Allah\u2019s permission \u2013 of enduring a severe battle similar to Mosul, nor are they capable of enduring a minute portion of the burdensome expenses which the Rafidah have endured throughout that battle, nor do they possess the great inherent strength required to assist them in replenishing those lost, or reinforcing those present, for we have seen how they were in the battle of Manbij and how they complained of collapse after only two months of battle, except that Allah accomplished a matter already destined.\nWhat is obligatory upon every mujahid in the city of Raqqah, wherever he is stationed, is to place in his calculations that this battle be a front for annihilating the murtaddin, a recompense for their disbelief in Allah the AlMighty, and their waging war against His religion,  and  a  final  payment  of  a  lengthy  bill  with them, for there is no end to this battle except that one of us will annihilate the other. Either we will exterminate them by Allah\u2019s might and strength \u2013 such that they lose in this world and in the Hereafter \u2013 or die trying, so that we would meet Allah having remained steadfast upon His religion, fighting his enemies, and succeed  as  the  companions  of  the  ditch  succeeded, and profit in the abode of the Hereafter \u2013 the abode of eternity \u2013 with no third option between us and them.

For today, it is the only battle on the primary outpost of Islam, and steadfastness therein and holding ribat on its lines means to safeguard the primary outpost, from which we can strike at kufr and aggression.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that we consider the enemy\u2019s entering and moving deep into the city, or that they become fortified on its outskirts, that they have achieved their goals and victory. No, for our battle with this enemy is a war of streets and cities, differing in its tactics and  methods,  defensively  and  offensively.  And  fierce wars are not decided over a period of days or weeks, but it takes a long time for the true announcement of success for either side.\nIt is enough for us that, before the results are decided, our eyes are cooled by seeing the sons of Islam standing firm like tall mountains on the blessed lines of Fallujah, teaching the Ummah new lessons of hardness, patience, and certainty.\n6ARTICLE\nPerhaps we could cast a look at some of these lessons \nand the great results produced by this lofty battle.\nFirst, this battle gave new life to the meanings of might, honor, and resistance, as the Ummah became certain that there is a group of its sons who are able to confront the grave dangers with boldness, steadfastness, and resolve; and that this group was truthful with its ummah in its plans and projects, through which the Ummah  was  revived  and  due  to  which  its  sons\u2019  and leaders\u2019 blood was often shed.\nSecond, the Ummah, during its time of humiliation and being fractured, learned that it is able to confront, perform ribat, and battle the heads of the earth and its oppressors with only a few of its sons and a light supply of weapons. It is thus able, thereby, to afflict the enemy with great and painful losses and to force them to sip from the bitter cup of defeat.\nThird, Fallujah opened the battleground for its contenders, igniting the directed efforts of the sons of Islam inside and outside of Iraq, and by shedding its pure blood which was spilled on its ground through many sons of Islam, in order for them to cover the costs of ji-\nARTICLE\fever  is  content,  then  this  is  the  Shari\u2019ah  of  Allah. Whoever dislikes it, is discontent with it, and refuses it, then we will continue in spite of him. This is the religion of Allah. We will declare the apostates as disbelievers and disavow them all. We will take the disbelievers and polytheists as enemies and hate them.\u201d\nThe Opinion of the Islamic State Is That of Its Imam, Those Whom He Delegated, and Its Offi-\ncial Spokesman\nIn refutation of those who spread their own misguided  opinions  and  beliefs,  marketing  them  to people  as  being  held  by  the  Islamic  State,  of  both the  people  of  ghulu  and  those  of  irja,  specifically  regarding  the  issues  of  takfir,  as  well  as  those who defame the \u2018aqidah and manhaj of the Islamic State, even making takfir of its soldiers and leaders, based  on  false  opinions  and  beliefs  that  they  have ascribed to it or due to their ignorance of the creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama\u2019ah, which they criticize whenever  it  opposes  their  desires,  the  Delegated Committee said in its blessed statement, \u201cAs for the statements that distort the creed of wala and bara, burying the millah of Ibrahim \uf06e in the shubuhat of people of irja (Murjii doctrine) and tajahhum (Jahmi doctrine). Likewise are the opinions of the people of ghulu (those extreme in matters of takfir), those who passed through the religion as the arrow passes through its target; the State is innocent of them. And  no  one  has  the  right  to  speak  in  its  name  or ascribe an opinion to it that it did not hold, for its saying is the saying of its Imam (may Allah honor him through tawhid), and those whom he delegates, or of its official spokesman. As for the fabricating of lies  and  speaking  based  on  assumption,  then  that is to speak without knowledge, which Allah c has forbidden.\u201d\nThe Islamic State Does Not Refrain from Making Takfir of the Mushrikin, and Makes Making Takfir of the Mushrikin One of the Utmost Principles of the Religion Brought by the Mes-\nsengers\nThe  Delegated  Committee  referred  to  various kinds of people of misguidance from those who fabricate  lies  against  the  Islamic  State,  those  who  as-\ncribe opinions to it that are not held by its leaders and beliefs that they have rejected.\nOf these are those who hold the opinions of irja, ascribing their own errors and deviances to the Islamic State, like how they \u201caccept the Islam of one who  does  not  make  takfir  of  his  people\u2019s  taghut,\u201d while \u201c[the Islamic State\u2019s official opinion] is that of making takfir of the tawaghit and whoever defends them and does not make takfir of them, without exception.\u201d  Similarly,  there  are  those  who  \u201ctreat  the making of takfir of mushrikin a matter that is khafiyyah  (obscure)  or  khilafiyyah  (disputable),  placing difficult restraints on its implementation, such that the  third  nullifier  of  Islam  is  completely  and  categorically  suspended  [\u2026]  Worse  than  this  is  that they claim that this opinion is that of the Islamic State! This is a pure fabrication. Those both far and near know that the Islamic State (may Allah honor it through tawhid) has not ceased for a single day from making  takfir  of  the  mushrikin,  and  that  it  treats the making of takfir of the mushrikin as one of the utmost  principles  of  the  religion,  which  must  be known before knowing the prayer and other obligations that are known of the religion by necessity. As such, in its statement that came from the Central Office Overseeing Shar\u2019i Dawawin, regarding the one who refrains from making takfir of the mushrikin, on  22/8/1437.\u201d\nWhat the memo meant when referring to \u201cprinciples of the religion\u201d (usul ad-din) are those matters of \u2018aqidah that the Prophets \uf070 taught their people, i.e. those matters directly established by their messages,  which  is  in  opposition  to  what  is  meant  by \u201cprinciple of the religion\u201d (asl ad-din), which is what was established before the messages came and before the messengers were sent \uf070, like the tawhid of Allah\u2019s rububiyyah (divinity) and uluhiyyah (worship).Also attributed to this kind of misguidance are those who \u201callow the shirk of tahakum (litigation) to the taghut with the claim of necessity, putting it in the status of ikrah (coercion),\u201d those who \u201creject the  ijma\u2019  of  the  Sahabah  on  making  takfir  of  the mumtani\u2019 factions (those who forcefully refuse the implementation of the Shari\u2019ah),\u201d those who \u201crefrain from making takfir of those who vote with the claim of their being ignorant of the reality of elections,\u201d and those who \u201cdo not make bara (disavowal) of the scholars  of  taghut  who  are  calling  to  committing shirk.\u201d\nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "And Likewise the Messengers Are Afflicted: Part 3", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "5"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq13", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah10-Among-the-Believers-Are-Men", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "28SHUHADA\nSHUHADA\fentered the building and carried out a massacre on the murtaddin inside for three consecutive hours, leading to approximately 30 Afghan policemen and journalists being killed and a number of others being wounded.\nEast Asia\n  On the 3rd of Sha\u2019ban, the soldiers of the Khilafah killed 5 soldiers of the Crusader Filipino army and wounded 6 others after detonating an explosive device in the city of Manila in the Philippines.\n  On the 10th of Sha\u2019ban, the soldiers of the Khilafah killed 5 Shi\u2019ah and wounded 6 others after detonating an explosive device on them in the middle of the city of Manila. \n  On the 14th of Sha\u2019ban, the soldiers of the Khilafah detonated an explosive device on a group of soldiers belonging to the Crusader Filipino army in the city of Cotabato in the southern Philippines, killing one of them and injuring three others.\n  On the 27th of Sha\u2019ban, the soldiers of the Khilafah launched a wide scale attack on positions of the Filipino Crusader forces in the city of Marawi located on  the  island  of  Mindanao  towards  the  south  of  the Philippines.

Meanwhile, 10 soldiers of the Filipino Crusader army were killed \u2013 among them four officers \u2013 and two military vehicles were destroyed in an attack by the soldiers of the Khilafah on the island of Jolo Sulu towards the southwest of the Philippines.\nTHE ATTACK ON THE CONVOY OF THE KUFFAR IN KABUL\n  On the 29th of Sha\u2019ban, two soldiers of the Khilafah carried out an attack targeting a gathering of the murtadd Indonesian police at a bus terminal in the city of Jakarta, killing a number of murtaddin.\n  On the 30th of Sha\u2019ban, the soldiers of the Khilafah burned an armored vehicle belonging to the Crusader Filipino army during the course of clashes in the city of Marawi.\n  On the 6th of Ramadan, the soldiers of the Khilafah captured two armored vehicles in an attack they carried out on a position held by the Filipino Crusader army in Marawi. They also killed four of their soldiers during the course of clashes that took place in the city. Likewise, 14 Filipino soldiers were killed when their position was mistakenly bombed in the city of Marawi. Meanwhile, Abul-Khayr al-Arkhabili \uf08a carried out an inghimasi attack on the Resorts World hotel in the city of Manila in the Philippines, killing at least 35 and injuring 70 others.\nQawqaz Wilayah\nOn the 16th of Sha\u2019ban, the soldiers of the Khilafah launched an attack on a murtadd police checkpoint in the city of Malgobek in Ingushetia.\nBaghdad Wilayah\nOn the 23rd of Sha\u2019ban, Abus-Sahabah al-Falluji \uf08a carried out an inghimasi attack on the Rafidi police at the Abu Dushayr checkpoint in the area of Dawrah in Baghdad. He clashed with them using his light-caliber weapon and then detonated his explosive belt in their midst. He was followed by Abu Jallad al-Jamili \uf08a, who detonated  his  explosive  vehicle  on  the  Rafidah  who were racing to the site of the attack.

As such, it is a foundational principle in the Shari\u2019ah of the last prophet \uf067, as it was clearly shown in his sirah and that of the Sahabah, who loudly proclaimed enmity towards the people of shirk in Makkah, then fought them with the sword and battled them after making hijrah to Madinah, to the point that one would kill his mushrik father or brother before other mushrikin, as long as they fought Allah and His Messenger.\nThe Prophet \uf067 Begins His Da\u2019wah by Disavowing \nthe Tawaghit\nEver since the Prophet \uf067 made his da\u2019wah public, he pronounced a clear enmity towards the mushrikin, faulted  their  alleged  gods,  and  warned  them  that  if they persisted in their kufr, they would be from the people of the Fire. Ibn Ishaq said, \u201cWhen the Messenger of Allah \uf067 first called his people to Islam and was public with that, as Allah ordered him to be, his people were not far from him. And they did not respond to him, according to what has reached me, until he mentioned  their  \u2018gods\u2019  and  faulted  them.  When  he did so, they regarded his act as an enormity and they rejected him. They unanimously agreed to oppose him and show hostility towards him, except those whom Allah protected with Islam, though they were few and hidden\u201d (Sirat Ibn Hisham). The Muslims then were also weak and lacked the means. However, publicly calling to tawhid required that they declare their disavowal of the tawaghit and that they show enmity to their worshipers.\nWhen Quraysh came to the Prophet \uf067 asking him to make exceptions in worship, such that he would worship their tawaghit sometimes and, in return, they would worship his god (Allah) for a time, ayat were revealed prohibiting that, showing there could be no convergence between tawhid and shirk. Ibn Hisham said,  \u201cAl-Aswad  Ibn  al-Muttalib  Ibn  Asad  Ibn  \u2018Abdil-\u2018Uzza,  al-Walid  Ibn  al-Mughirah,  Umayyah  Ibn Khalaf, and al-\u2018As Ibn Wail as-Sahmi \u2013 who were all elders among their people \u2013 confronted Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 as he was walking around the Ka\u2019bah. They said, \u2018O Muhammad, come, let us worship what you worship and you worship what we worship, so that we can share in this matter. If that which you worship turns out to be better than what we worship, we will have had our portion of it, and if what we worship turns out to be better than what you worship, you will \nhave had your portion of it.\u2019 At that, Allah revealed, \u2018Say, \u201cO disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship. Nor are you worshippers of what I worship. Nor will I be a worshipper of what you worship. Nor will you be worshippers of what I worship. For you is your religion, and for me is my religion\u2019 (Al-Kafirun).\u201d\nThe Muslims Fight Their Mushrik Relatives\nWhen Allah facilitated the hijrah of His Prophet to Madinah and an Islamic state was established therein, disavowal of the mushrikin was no longer counted to be merely declaring enmity to them and dispraising them. Rather, waging jihad against them and fighting them until they surrender to the command of Allah was added to it.\nAt Badr (2 AH), the swords of the muwahhidin met those of their mushrik cousins who warred against the religion of Allah. The Muslims did not wane in fighting and harming them. Some Sahabah saw their fathers and brothers slain before their eyes, and some of them killed their relatives with their own hands. When Allah blessed the Muslims with victory, and the Muslims detained large numbers of mushrikin, \u2018Umar al-Faruq \uf068 expressed the opinion, which would later be supported by divine decree, that those captives should be killed \u2013 and that each should be killed at the hands of his relative.\nMuslim reported that Ibn \u2018Abbas \uf06b said, \u201cWhen they took the captives, the Messenger of Allah \uf067 said to Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar, \u2018What do you think about these prisoners?\u2019 Abu Bakr said, \u2018O Prophet of Allah, they are cousins and from the tribe. I suggest that you take a ransom from them, which we could use to gain strength against the kuffar, and perhaps Allah would guide them to Islam.\u2019 The Messenger of Allah \uf067 said, \u2018What do you say, Ibnul-Khattab?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah. I do not think what Abu Bakr thinks. But I think we have gained the ability to strike their necks, so \u2018Ali should strike the neck of \u2018Aqil (his brother) and I strike the neck of so-and-so (his relative), as these are the leaders and champions of kufr.\u2019 The Messenger of Allah \uf067 favored what Abu Bakr said and did not favor what \u2018Umar said. When \u2018Umar showed up the next day, the Messenger of Allah \uf067 and Abu Bakr were sitting and weeping. \u2018Umar said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, tell me what makes you and your companion weep. If I find the weeping to be worthy, I too shall weep; otherwise, I will feign it [to do as you do].\u2019 So the Messenger of Allah \uf067 said, \n\f", "schema:headline": "La Ilaha Illallah in Word and Deed", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "21"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah8-And-Fight-the-Mushrikin-Collectively", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "ArticleArticle\n\fJourneying in Search of the People of Truth\nborders and airports. So he returned to the birthplace of his fathers in Sham, staying in the city of Aleppo for a few years, seeking knowledge, calling his family and friends to tawhid, and anticipating his next chance to wage jihad. All the while, he was keen to avoid the eyes of the intelligence agency and avoid sitting with the  evil  scholars  who  were  allied  with  the  tawaghit. Eventually, the FBI issued an international warrant for \nThe  Dunya  and  its  adornments  could  not  tempt him. Scholastic degrees and their deception could not confine him. Neither a spouse, nor wealth, nor children could entice him away from his religion. Rather, he cast all of that behind him when he understood tawhid and knew that jihad in Allah\u2019s cause is the best proof of  his  allegiance  to the  Muslims  and his  disavowal  of  the mushrikin,  amongst whom  he  was  born, raised as a child, and entered  into  manhood.He \ncompleted his  studies  in  Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts  in  Boston, graduating as an engineer and programmer, before resolving to  go  forth  in  the cause  of  Allah  with some  of  his  friends. So they left as muhajirin to Allah, not coordinating their journey with anyone. They roamed between Yemen, Pakistan, and Iraq, hoping to meet someone who would bring them to the mujahidin. But once they became weary of finding the way, and as they feared inciting the suspicions of intelligence agencies, they returned to America, asking Allah c to guide them towards their goal.\nHe didn\u2019t stay long until he decided to try and make America itself the frontlines for his jihad and the place for his martyrdom. So he planned, along with two of his companions, to carry out an operation that would target Americans in their own land. They drew up their plans for their desired operation, including the seizure of  some  weapons  from  the  Crusaders,  which  they would then use for an attack behind enemy lines that they hoped would cause the killing of a large number of mushrikin. However, Allah decreed otherwise, and He does what He wills. Their plot was discovered just days before the operation\u2019s appointed time. But Allah saved him from falling into captivity, allowing him to leave America before the FBI could gather sufficient information  to  release  an  order  for  his  arrest  at  the \nQasim ar-Rimi, one of the Jews of jihad exposed by Shaykh Abu Sulayman\nhis arrest and put a $50,000 reward on his head.\nComing to the Islamic State\nAt  the  beginning  of  the  jihad  in  Sham,  Abu  Sulayman \uf08a went out in search of the people of tawhid among the various fighting factions. He fought alongside  one  of  the  factions  until  he  was  wounded  in  a battle against the Nusayriyyah in a neighborhood of Halab. Then, when he heard that the soldiers of the Islamic State had come to Sham, working under the name \u201cJabhat an-Nusrah li-Ahl ash-Sham,\u201d he joined up  with  them  and  met  with  their  leaders,  knowing that they were soldiers of Shaykh Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi \uf085, the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq at the time.  He  requested  that  they  transfer  him  to  Iraq, but they did not give their consent. He then insisted  that  they  allow  him  to  execute  an  istishhadi  operation against the Nusayriyyah, but they postponed their  response  to  him.  So  he  continued  to  give  lessons on \u2018aqidah to those of the mujahidin who were with him, performing ribat on the fronts of Aleppo \n\f", "schema:headline": "And Fight the Mushrikin Collectively", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "37"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah1-Interview-with-the-Amir-of-the-Central-Office-for-Investigating-Grievances", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "1", "schema:articleBody": "In  his  conversation  with  the  Islamic State\u2019s  Naba  newsletter,  the  amir  of  the Central Office for Investigating Grievances clarified  the  reason  behind  the  office\u2019s  establishment, and the role it plays in eliminating the injustices that might afflict both the  subjects  and  soldiers  of  the  Islamic State. He likewise clarified the mechanism through which the office works to process the  cases  that  reach  it,  eventually  settling them  by  either  removing  injustice  from those afflicted by it or verifying the absence of  injustice  in  a  case  and  informing  the complainant  thereof.\nQuestion: Why was the Central Office \nfor Investigating Grievances established?\nAnswer: All praise is due to Allah. May Allah\u2019s blessings be upon His noble messenger and those who follow his guidance until the Day of Judgment. As for what follows:\nIndeed,  Allah  \uf062  ordered  justice  and made it among His lofty attributes. He \uf063 said, \u201cIndeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality  and  bad  conduct  and  oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will  be  reminded\u201d  (An-Nahl  90).  He  \uf063 also said, \u201cAnd the word of your Lord has been  fulfilled  in  truth  and  justice.  None can alter His words, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 115). He \uf063 likewise negated injustice from Himself; He \uf063 \n10said, \u201cIndeed, Allah does not wrong the people, but it is the people who wrong themselves\u201d (Yunus 44).\nHe  \uf063  also  forbade  injustice  in  all  its  forms,  including  associating partners with Allah, which is the greatest act of injustice, as Allah \uf063 has described: \u201cAnd [mention], when Luqman said to his son while he was instructing him, \u2018O my son, do not commit shirk with Allah. Indeed, shirk is a great injustice\u2019\u201d (Luqman 13). It is also from injustice for a person to wrong himself by disobeying the command of Allah \uf062 and transgressing His limits, as He \uf063 said, \u201cAnd whoever transgresses the limits of Allah has certainly wronged himself\u201d (At-Talaq 1). It is also from injustice for a person to wrong another individual by transgressing against his rights, as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cHe [Dawud] said, \u2018He has certainly wronged you in demanding your ewe [in addition] to his ewes. And indeed, many associates oppress one another, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds \u2013 and few are they\u2019\u201d (Sad 24).\nIndeed, the establishment of the religion is not fully actualized except with the removal of all forms of injustice, and this is what the Islamic State today is working to achieve, by Allah\u2019s grace. By waging war against shirk and subjecting the people to the rule of the Lord of all creation, the greater injustice is eliminated. And by commanding virtue and forbidding vice that which becomes manifest of man\u2019s injustice towards himself through sin and vice is eliminated. And by estab-\n\fAustralia after the blessed attacks of September 11th, following which the camp of iman and kufr became more distinct. The so-called \u201cIslamic\u201d organizations in Australia were pressured to do things in order to appease the kuffar, change  their  da\u2019wah,  and  practice  \u201cIslam\u201d  in  a  manner that  was  acceptable  to  the  Australian  government.  The so-called \u201cMuslim\u201d imams cloaked their cowardice with the words \u201chikmah\u201d and \u201cmaslahah\u201d until, as Shaykh Anwar al-\u2018Awlaqi \uf08a described, they left the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad \uf067 and \u201cmaslahah\u201d became an idol that they began to worship.\nAbu Mansur, however, was not one to make concessions to the kuffar at the expense of his religion. This angered the Australian government forcing them to plot against the  muhawiddin  with  new,  retrospective  anti-terrorism laws that allowed them to prosecute and imprison Abu Mansur for being part of a terrorist organization. As Allah says, \u201cThey resented them not except because they believed in Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy\u201d (Al-Buruj 8). They also hated and targeted Abu Mansur and his likes because of their disassociation from the kuffar, which was nothing but the excellent example of Ibrahim \uf06e, who said to his people, \u201cIndeed, we are innocent of you and from whatever you worship other than Allah. We have disbelieved in you, and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone\u201d (Al-Mumtahanah 4).\nDuring his imprisonment, Abu Mansur witnessed the betrayal of the imams of kufr, which added to his feeling of  strangeness.  In  particular,  he  witnessed  the  treachery \nof the apostate Samir Mohtadi, who volunteered as a witness for the prosecution against the brothers, as well as the apostate Mohammed Omran (Abu Ayman), who called on his followers to participate in the kufri religion of democracy,  and  also  called  on  them  to  disassociate  themselves from the imprisoned brothers and their families. At the same time, these \u201cimams\u201d competed with one another to appease the kuffar by erecting \u201cmoderate\u201d Islamic centers. Rather than inciting their followers to carry swords, they  encouraged  them  to  carry  pamphlets  and  make \u201cstreet  da\u2019wah\u201d  to  bikini-clad  women.  They  carried  on with their pacifist and even pro-democracy da\u2019wah while Muslim women around the world were being abused, vilified, imprisoned, and violated at the hands of the kuffar and their puppets. This was one of the things that burned Abu Mansur the most, for he had tremendous jealousy for his sisters and his eyes would well with tears every time he heard of their suffering.\nAs  the  fitnah  of  strangeness  increased  around  Abu Mansur during his five years of imprisonment, his iman also  increased  and  he  drew  closer  to  his  Lord.  Despite missing  the  birth  of  his  eldest  son  and  his  daughters\u2019 childhoods, he remained patient, spending his time memorizing much of the Quran and reflecting upon it and the reality of sacrifice. Abu Mansur was released from prison more emboldened and more steadfast upon this path. He quickly set out to make hijrah, leaving behind his beloved wife and four children in order to bring triumph to this religion and to quench his thirst for the blood of the Nusayriyyah.\nAbu Ayman shows support for the Turkish tawaghit\n\f", "schema:headline": "Interview with the Amir of the Central Office for Investigating Grievances", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "9"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah9", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah1-Operations", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "1", "schema:articleBody": "As the soldiers of the Khilafah continue waging war on the forces of kufr, we take a glimpse at a number of recent operations conducted by the mujahidin of the Islamic State that have succeeded  in  expanding  the  territory of  the  Khilafah,  or  terrorizing,  massacring,  and  humiliating  the  enemies of Allah. These operations are merely a selection of the numerous operations that  the  Islamic  State  has  conducted on various fronts across many regions over the course of the last few weeks.\nBarakah Wilayah\nThe  soldiers  of  the  Khilafah  took control  of  vast  territory,  including  a number  of  villages  south  of  the  city of Shaddadi, where they succeeded in killing more than 124 murtaddin and wounding  dozens  of  others,  in  addition  to  taking  their  weapons  and  vehicles as ghanimah. This rapid assault, which lasted only a few hours, brought the  mujahidin  closer  to  the  city  of Shaddadi.\nThis  occurred  when  the  soldiers  of the  Islamic  State  carried  out  a  wide scale assault on locations of the murtadd PKK, close to the city of Shaddadi, which caused a breakdown in the ranks of the murtaddin after only two hours  from  the  time  clashes  erupted. The assault led to the mujahidin taking  control  of  several  villages  around the  city.\nThe Islamic State soldiers began with an assault on the 20th of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah, using  heavy  weapons  to  pound  the positions of the murtadd PKK in the village of Kashkash Jubur, wherein the murtaddin  had  fortified  themselves, which forced them to flee the village. An  assault  unit  of  the  Islamic  State then entered. After combing the area, they  secured  their  control  of  the  village.\nThe  soldiers  of  the  Khilafah  continued  their  advance  and  succeeded in  entering  the  southern  section  of the village of \u2018Azzawi, while inghimasi  groups  simultaneously  cut  off  the \nroads which connect the village to the city of Shaddadi and were being used \n\fOn that path, the Tabi\u2019in and the rest of the imams traveled, having for themselves many ventures in the fields of ribat and combat, despite jihad and ribat \u2013 in their days \u2013 being only fard kifayah (communally, not personally, obligatory).\nThese were the imams among the people of hadith and zuhd (disregard for the worldly life). Just as they participated in narrating knowledge, they also participated in ribat, guarding outposts, and archery. These are the likes of al-Awza\u2019i,  \u2018Abdullah  Ibn  al-Mubarak,  Ibnul-Qasim,  Abu  Ishaq al-Fizari,  Makhlad  Ibn  al-Husayn,  Ibrahim  Ibn  Adham, Hudhayfah al-Mar\u2019ishi, Yusuf Ibn Asbat, and many others. Indeed,  they  translated  their  knowledge  into  action  with ribat and jihad. There were even some muhaddithin who would stay in towns bordering Dar al-Harb so they could always be in ribat, like the Imam \u2018Isa Ibn Yunus. As such, the two imams Ibnul-Mubarak and Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, as well as others, would say, \u201cIf the people disagree about something, then examine what the people of the frontlines are upon, as the truth is with them, for Allah \uf063 says, \u2018And those who perform jihad for Us, We shall surely guide them to Our paths\u2019\u201d (Al-\u2018Ankabut 69).\nThroughout the ages, scholars from the people of hadith were found upholding the duty of jihad and declaring the truth, like Shaykhul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, who openly declared the truth and waged jihad, fighting against the Tatars,  and  Imam  Muhammad  Ibn  \u2018Abdil-Wahhab,  who fought  the  mushrikin  inside  the  Arabian  Peninsula  and waged jihad against them with weapons and words.\nEven in our time, there have been those by whom Allah revived both knowledge and creed, those who went public  with  the  truth  and  by  whom  the  truth  became  manifest. They were those who joined knowledge with jihad, like  Shaykh  Abu  Mus\u2019ab  az-Zarqawi,  Shaykh  Abu  Anas ash-Shami,  Shaykh  \u2018Abdullah  ar-Rashud,  Shaykh  AbulHasan  al-Filistini,  and  Shaykh  Maysarah  al-Gharib  \uf073.\nLikewise,  those  who  know  but  do  not  act  upon  their knowledge are dispraised according to the Shari\u2019ah. They are not considered \u201cthose with knowledge\u201d and are not called \u201cscholars\u201d with the meaning intended by the Shari\u2019ah. How could such persons be called \u201cscholars\u201d while they are hated by Allah and have earned His wrath?! Indeed, Allah got angry with the Jews and called them \u201cal-maghdub \u2018alayhim\u201d (those who have conjured His anger) due to their not acting upon their knowledge.\nAnd Allah \uf063 also said, \u201cGreatly hated, according to Allah, is that you say what you do not do\u201d (As-Saff 3). This verse contains evidence of Allah\u2019s great hatred for those who know but do not act.\nFurthermore, the Quran clarifies that whoever knows the truth  but  conceals  his  knowledge  is  cursed,  as  in  His \uf063 saying, \u201cVerily those who conceal what We revealed of clear evidences and guidance after We clarified such to the people in the Book, [then] these Allah curses and the cursers [also] \ncurse them\u201d (Al-Baqarah 159). It is known from all of the above that \u201cthose with knowledge\u201d are those who carry it, act upon it, and openly declare it.\nAllah  even  described  whoever  does  not  act  upon  his knowledge as being ignorant, as in His saying about the \u201cscholars\u201d of the Jews who followed sorcery, \u201cAnd they did surely know that whoever purchased it shall have nothing in the Hereafter, and how bad is that for which they sold their souls, if only they knew\u201d (Al-Baqarah 102). The evidence in this ayah is His saying, \u201cand they did surely know\u201d followed by \u201cif only they knew,\u201d as by not acting upon their knowledge, they were ignorant.\nAs such, whoever does not act upon his knowledge by openly  declaring  it  and  waging  jihad  or  by  concealing  it and dressing up the truth in falsehood, then he is not truly a scholar. Rather, he is a devil \u2013 whether vocal or mute.\nThe people of knowledge did not count the people of bida\u2019 (heretical innovations) as scholars, just as Ibn \u2018Abdil-Barr said  regarding  the  heretics  of  kalam  (polemical  speech), \u201cThe people of fiqh and athar (traditional narrations) in the major cities have altogether agreed that the people of polemics are people of heresy and deviance, and are not counted among the ranks of the fuqaha, and the scholars are only the people of athar\u201d (Jami\u2019 Bayan al-\u2018Ilm wa Fadlih), so how would it be if they were to have seen how the Ummah has been afflicted with the imams of kufr today?\nAnyone who looks at those who are ascribed to knowledge in our later times will find that the vast majority of them are not scholars and are not counted among the people of knowledge, due to their failure to fulfill the duty of action. They did not declare the truth in the faces of the tawaghit, but instead concealed the knowledge and dressed up the truth in falsehood, misguiding the slaves of Allah while they knew of the verses regarding fighting and combat. They turned away from their duty of action, thus being at odds with the Sunnah of the Prophet \uf067 and that of the Sahabah and Tabi\u2019in. They are seen as having studied the texts of wala and bara, yet wandered away from them. They learned the verses regarding the obligation of conveying and clarifying the truth, yet they concealed it and resorted to flattering Allah\u2019s enemies. Are these the ones whom Allah called \u201cthose with knowledge?!\u201d Far be it from Him! Certainly not! Rather, they are the people of misguidance who are threatened with punishment for abandoning action and concealing the truth. How then, if one knows that most of those who are famously attributed to knowledge in our time have displayed their obedience to the taghut and have entered into his allegiance, supporting him against any of the muwahiddin who rise against him? The ruling about whoever does this is well-known in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger \uf067.\nTherefore, Ibn Baz, Ibn \u2018Uthaymin, al-Fawzan, Al ashShaykh (the contemporaries), Muhammad Hassan, al-Huwayni, Husayn Ya\u2019qub, al-Qardawi, al-Buti, an-Nabulusi, al-Ghiryani, al-Maqdisi, Abu Qatadah, al-Haddushi, and \n\f", "schema:headline": "Operations", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "21"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah1-Among-the-Believers-Are-Men:-Abu-Mansur-al-Muhajir", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "1", "schema:articleBody": "\u201cAnd  whoever  Allah  guides  \u2013  for  him there is no misleader.

He chose, instead, to surrender his soul in obedience of his Lord and to wield the weapons of faith and honor in defiance of the kafir masses.  He  remained  steadfast  in  the  face of  everything  he  was  afflicted  with,  never weakening, never surrendering, until Allah gave him triumph and his blood was spilled, pouring forth and fueling the lantern that illuminates  this  noble  path  so  that  those who follow may traverse upon a clear road.\nIndeed, this is the path of those who are truthful  with  their  Lord,  and  no  man  has ever marched upon it and tasted the sweetness of self-sacrifice, except that they did so \nthrough  Allah\u2019s  guidance,  and  if  we  were  to reflect on the story of Abu Mansur, and the story of the mujahir mujahid in general, we would truly be humbled by the monumental statement  of  our  Lord,  \u201cAllah  guides  whom He wills to a straight path\u201d (Al-Baqarah 213). \nAbu  Mansur  \u2013  originally  from  Lebanon \u2013  came  from  Melbourne,  Australia,  a  land cloaked  in  darkness  and  corrupted  by  kufr, fornication,  and  all  forms  of  vice.  Yet  even in the midst of this darkness \u2013 and by Allah\u2019s will \u2013 the flame of tawhid was ignited within his heart at the young age of 22 through the da\u2019wah of a brother who visited the grieving Abu Mansur shortly after the death of his eldest brother, Mansur. Thereafter, Abu Mansur made his way the way of the true believer, answering Allah\u2019s clear statement, \u201cSo do not weaken and do not grieve, and you will be superior if you are believers\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 139).\nWith  a  newly  acquired  unyielding  fervor and  zeal  for  his  religion,  Abu  Mansur  raced his brothers towards righteousness. He invited others to this noble path, but only to be confronted with the fitnah of strangeness and severe enmity, which began surfacing itself in \n14\ffor His cause \u2013 to spend what is dear and beloved to them in seeking His pleasure. For verily the goal is for Allah to be the most beloved thing to them, and for nothing else in existence to be more beloved to them than Him. So if out of His love they freely gave something they loved, He would move them on to another, better position \u2013 which is that they freely give their souls to Him, and that is the greatest extent of love\u201d (Badai\u2019 al-Fawaid).\nIt is known that women \u2013 other than those whom Allah protects, and they are very few \u2013 often engage in nonsense, showing ingratitude towards their husbands, backbiting, and other grave sins. So the Prophet \uf067 guided them to that  through  which  they  could  atone  for  some  of  what they have committed in this worldly life. Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 went out to the place of prayer on one of the days of Eid, either Adha or Fitr, and he passed by the women. So he said, \u201cO women, give charity, for verily I was shown that you make up the majority of the people of Hellfire.\u201d They said, \u201cWhy, O Messenger of Allah?\u201d He said, \u201cYou curse  so  much  and  are  ungrateful  to  your  husbands\u2026\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Abu Sa\u2019id al-Khudri).\nA good example for women is Asma Bint Abi Bakr \uf06b who, despite her poverty and need, and though she did not own any gold or jewelry, would ask the Prophet \uf067 about charity. She said, \u201cI said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, I have nothing except what az-Zubayr placed in my house [of what he gave her]. Should I give some of it [in charity]?\u2019 He said, \u2018Give and do not horde things, lest Allah keep things from you\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nIbn Hajar said, \u201cThe meaning of this hadith is the prohibition of restricting charity due to a fear of depletion, as that is the greatest reason for the absence of blessing, since Allah rewards \u2013 without measure \u2013 those who give. And whoever gives freely without counting how much he gave, then  he  will  be  given  without  measure  [by  Allah].  And whoever knows that Allah provides for him from whence he does not expect should give and not calculate\u201d (Fath al-Bari).\nAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 also said, \u201cVerily Allah \uf062 accepts charity, takes it by His right hand and raises it for one of you, as one of you raises his foal, until a morsel becomes like the size of Uhud\u201d (Reported by at-Tirmidhi from Abu Hurayrah).\nHow, then, about the charity given to help prepare the mujahidin for Allah\u2019s cause? Does anyone establish the religion and protect the lands of Islam other than the mujahidin? Does anyone defend honor and spite the kuffar other than the mujahidin?\nAl-Bukhari  reported  in  \u201cChapter:  The  Excellence  of One Who Prepares a Fighter or Takes Care of His Family,\u201d from Zayd Ibn Khalid \uf068 that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever prepares a fighter for Allah\u2019s cause has himself fought, and whoever takes care of the family of a fighter \nfor Allah\u2019s cause has himself fought.\u201d This is what Amirul-Muminin \u2018Uthman Ibn \u2018Affan \uf068 comprehended when he conducted his business with Allah, for which his reward  was  Paradise.  He  did  not  prepare  a  single  fighter, but rather an entire army for the Battle of Tabuk. It was the Army of \u2018Usrah, and what can make you comprehend what the Army of \u2018Usrah was? That was the army called \u201c\u2018Usrah\u201d  (hardship)  because  it  was  during  difficult  days and hard times for the Muslims. \u2018Abdur-Rahman Ibn Samurah  \uf068  narrated  that  \u2018Uthman  came  to  the  Prophet \uf067 with one-thousand dinars when he was preparing the Army of \u2018Usrah and dropped them in the Prophet\u2019s lap. \u2018Abdur-Rahman said, \u201cI saw the Prophet \uf067 looking at the money as he said two times, \u2018Whatever \u2018Uthman does after today will not harm him\u2019\u201d (Reported by at-Tirmidhi).\nIndeed,  Shaykhul-Islam  Ibn  Taymiyyah  mentioned  a concise yet valuable fiqh-related statement regarding the status of waging jihad with one\u2019s wealth, putting it ahead of other forms of charity. He \uf072 said, \u201cIf the wealth was insufficient to both feed those who would die of hunger and to fund the jihad which would be harmed without it, we put waging jihad ahead, even if the hungry starved to death. This is like the issue of targeting human shields, but even more appropriate, as in that case we would be killing them by our own direct actions, while in this case they would die due to Allah\u2019s action alone\u201d (Al-Fatawa alKubra).\nWhen  we  reflect  over  the  condition  of  some  of  the women today, we notice them spending extravagantly on transient  worldly  things  of  clothing,  jewelry,  feasts,  and so  forth.  All  the  while,  we  see  them  being  miserly  and stingy when it comes to the religion of Allah \uf063 \u2013 though He is Rich and we are needy. \u201cHere you are, those who are called to spend for Allah\u2019s cause, yet some of you are stingy. And whoever is stingy is only stingy against himself. And Allah is Rich and you are needy. And if you turn away, He will substitute [you] with another people, and they  will  not  be  like  you\u201d  (Muhammad  38).  So  is  the Muslim woman\u2019s hand open to spend on the worldly life but closed to spend on what benefits her in the Hereafter? Will not someone follow the example of Sawdah \uf069, the Prophet\u2019s wife and the Mother of the Believers? \u2018Aishah \uf069 narrated that some of the Prophet\u2019s wives \uf06c said to the Prophet \uf067, \u201cWhich of us will be quickest to join you?\u201d He said, \u201cThe one with the longest arm.\u201d So they took a reed and measured (each other\u2019s arms), and Sawdah had the longest arm. \u2018Aishah said, \u201cWe learned later that she had the longest arm [in that she would extend it most] in sadaqah. Sawdah was the quickest to join him. She loved giving charity\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nThe Muslim woman must not think that Allah \uf063 only accepts what is much and abundant. Rather, a single dirham could very likely outdo more than a thousand, and half  a  date  given  by  its  owner  as  charity  in  this  world could very likely save him from the fire of the Hereafter.

Rather, from the most important forms of jihad by the tongue is du\u2019a, by \n32Article\nArticle\fSome historians mention that one of the kings of India made an offer to the Sultan in exchange that he stop destroying their idols and temples, saying, \u201cI know that this is something by which you get closer to your Lord, but have you  not  brought  yourselves  close  enough  by  destroying these idols and temples, especially at the fort of Nakarkart?\u201d He then promised to pay large sums of money to this end, but the Sultan refused and proclaimed that he was fighting to make Allah\u2019s word supreme and to obtain His contentment \u2013 not for the sake of this temporal world. He then hurried to the temple to destroy their idols, except for one idol, which he took with him so that it could be trampled underfoot in his own land.\nDespite  these  riches,  the  Sultan  was  not  driven  by worldly gain upon exerting this great effort in raids and destruction. Rather, he wanted to put an end to the worship \nIn the year 407AH, the conquests of Sultan Mahmud took him to one of the most heavily fortified temples. Ibnul-Athir said, \u201cThey kept many idols in it, including five made of pure gold and studded with gemstones. The gold therein totaled 690,300 dinars. There were also around two hundred idols carved from stone. Yamin ad-Dawlah took all of the treasures and destroyed everything else. He then marched on Kannauj\u2026 He took its forts and seven surrounding towns located along the river. In the area, there were nearly 10,000 idol houses, which they falsely claimed to have been 200,000 to 300,000 years old. When he conquered them, his military pillaged them all.\u201d\nBut  the  most  significant  victory  of  the  Sultan  \u2013  regarding his destruction of idols \u2013 and that which had the greatest effect, was when he destroyed the major, pagan, Indian idol called Somnath in the year 416AH. Ibnul-Athir described it, saying, \u201cThis idol was the largest idol of the Indians, who would make pilgrimage to it every night of an eclipse. About 100,000 people would gather\u2026 and they would  carry  anything  of  value  to  it,  giving  its  caretakers large sums of money. The idol had endowments amounting to 10,000 villages.\u201d\nof idols by destroying what the Indians considered to be the \u201cleader\u201d of idols. Ibnul-Athir said, \u201cEvery time Yamin ad-Dawlah was victorious in India, the Indians would say, \u2018Somnath was displeased with those idols. If he was pleased with them, he would have destroyed whoever sought them harm.\u2019 When this reached Yamin ad-Dawlah, he was determined to attack and destroy this Somnath, thinking that if the Indians were bereft of it and saw the falsehood of their claim, they would enter into Islam. So he prayed istikharah and marched from Ghaznah on the 10th of Sha\u2019ban in 416AH with 30,000 of his regular cavalry, not to mention those who volunteered.\u201d\nThe road to reaching this idol was hard and strenuous, as it required the crossing of desert terrain. But such risks did not deter the muwahhid Sultan\u2019s determination to destroy this  idol.  Ibnul-Athir  said,  \u201cWhen  he  crossed  the  desert, at its edge he saw fortresses fully stationed with fighters, as well as many wells, which the Indians had filled with sand in order to prevent him from besieging their fortresses. Allah then facilitated their conquest, upon him getting close, by casting terror into their hearts, so they surrendered. He killed the residents, destroyed their idols, and took what was needed of water and provisions.\u201d Thus, the Sultan reached Somnath after traversing deserts, battling peoples, and laying siege to forts. Ibnul-Athir said, \u201cHe reached Somnath on the day of Khamis in the middle of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah and saw a heavily fortified fortress built on the oceanfront. The sea waves would reach part of the fortress. Its people were sitting on the walls, gazing at the Muslims and entrusting their idol to foil the plan of the Muslims and make them perish.\u201d  Such  is  the  foolish  mentality  of  idol  worshipers. How then could they ever face the soldiers of tawhid, those who wage jihad for Allah\u2019s cause in order to purge the earth from the filth of shirk and its people?\nIbnul-Athir  relates  to  us  the  details  of  the  battle  and the shock of the pagans at the inactivity of their idol, as it remained motionless in front of those who came to destroy it.

He further taught them that if it were not for jihad, the world would be filled with corruption. \u201cAnd  if  it  were  not  for  Allah  curbing  people  by  means of others, the earth would become corrupt, but Allah has much bounty for the creation\u201d (Al-Baqarah 251).\nYet despite the command to wage jihad, despite Allah\u2019s assurance of the immense good it contains for us, despite the well-being of the earth being at stake, and even despite the countless virtues and rewards promised by Allah and His Messenger for the mujahid, the murabit, and especially the shahid, there would always continue to be \u201cmen\u201d who would fail to live up to this lofty obligation. They would remain behind, making excuse after excuse, despite the clear signs placed before them, as if implying that jihad no longer exists. When this false insinuation had first reared its head during the life of the Prophet \uf067, he firmly refuted it, as Salamah Ibn Nufayl al-Kindi \uf068 narrated, \u201cI was sitting with Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 when a man said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, the people have humiliated their horses, have put down their swords, and have said, \u2018There is no jihad, for the war has laid down its burdens.\u2019\u2019 So Allah\u2019s \n2Foreword\nMessenger \uf067 turned his face towards him and said, \u2018They have lied. The fighting has just begun, and there will not cease to be a people from my Ummah fighting upon the truth\u2019\u201d (Reported by an-Nasai).\nHowever,  even  this  clear  statement  from  the  Prophet \uf067 himself would make no difference to most of the qa\u2019idin (those men who \u201csit back\u201d instead of participating in jihad) and the murjifin (scaremongers). Instead, they would remain upon their misguided way of life, choosing to lay down their swords, whether because they were too busy chasing the Dunya, too cowardly to fight for the cause of Allah, or too blinded to recognize the obligation for which they will be held accountable.\nRegardless of their excuses and misguidance, and despite the multitudes who turned their backs on the very deed described by the Prophet \uf067 as \u201cthe peak of Islam,\u201d (Reported by Ibn Majah and at-Tirmidhi from Mu\u2019adh Ibn Jabal), jihad against the enemies of Allah would continue.  Allah  would  humiliate  those  who  abandoned  it, honor those who embarked upon it, and direct His sincere slaves to keep their swords unsheathed for His sake.\n\u2018Aishah \uf069 narrated, saying, \u201cWhen Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 returned on the Day of the Trench, he put down his sword and bathed. Jibril \uf06e, with dust covering his head, came to him and said, \u2018You have laid down the sword? By Allah, I have not laid mine down.\u2019 So Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u2018Where to then?\u2019 He said, \u2018Over there,\u2019 and gestured towards  Bani  Quraydhah.\u201d  She  said,  \u201cAllah\u2019s  Messenger \uf067 then set out for them\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nThus, the Sunnah of the Prophet \uf067 was to march forth \nArticle\fThe memorandum then explains that \u201cit is wrong to use the terms asl (foundational basis) and lazim (required inference) with regards to the meaning of \u2018la ilaha illallah\u2019 and kufr bit-taghut in an argumentative manner. That is because doing so is a fruitless, invented assertion with which Allah did not burden us. Rather, multiple corrupt inferences necessarily result therefrom, like excluding certain  matters  established  by  the  advent  of  the  prophetic proof from being part of asl ad-din \u2013 in accordance with this definition \u2013 and thus excluding belief in the prophethood of Muhammad \uf067 from asl ad-din! Likewise, it leads to disputation \u2026 regarding what is included in the meaning of asl ad-din and what is excluded from it.\u201d\nThe memorandum then quotes Shaykh Sulayman Ibn \u2018Abdillah  Ibn  Muhammad  Ibn  \u2018Abdil-Wahhab  \uf073,  who was asked about a similar issue, \u201cregarding wala and bara,\u201d if such were \u201cfrom the meaning of \u2018la ilaha illallah\u2019 or from its inferred requirements?\u201d Shaykh Sulayman \uf072 responded, \u201cThe answer is to say that Allah knows best. But it is sufficient for a Muslim to know that Allah made it a duty upon him to take the mushrikin as enemies and to not take them as awliya, and He made it obligatory to love the believers and to take them as awliya. He made this an essential of iman, just as He negated the iman of whoever shows love to those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers, sons, brothers, or tribesmen. As for wala and bara being from the meaning of \u2018la ilaha illallah\u2019 or from its inferred requirements, then Allah did not burden us with researching this. He only burdened us with knowing that Allah made wala and bara a duty and obligation and that He obligated acting on the basis of wala and bara. This, undoubtedly, is what is obligatory and necessary. Thereafter, whoever knows whether wala and bara are from the meaning of \u2018la ilaha illallah\u2019 or from its inferred requirements, then knowing such is fine and an added benefit. But whoever does not know such, is not burdened to know. This is especially so if the argument or dispute over the matter leads to evil, conflict, and discord among the believers \u2013 those who upheld the obligations of iman, waged jihad for Allah\u2019s sake, took the mushrikin as enemies, and took the Muslims as awliya. Therefore, remaining silent on such matters that lead to division is definitely obligatory. This is what is apparent to me. Nevertheless, the two sides are similar in meaning. And Allah knows best\u201d (Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah).\nThe  memorandum  then  addresses  another  term,  in addition to those mentioned before, stating that \u201cit is unacceptable to use the term takfir al-\u2018adhir (takfir of the excuser) to describe the ruling of the one who refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam, because it is an inaccurate term. While we reject ignorance as an excuse for major shirk, this innovated opinion (of excusing \u2013 for ignorance  \u2013  those  claimants  of  Islam  who  commit  major shirk) does not necessitate that every excuser refrains from making takfir, as there are those of them who might consider ignorance an excuse, but who do indeed make takfir of the mushrikin because he considers the hujjah to have been established against them, so he is therefore not a refrainer. Likewise, refraining from making takfir of the mushrikin is not confined to the issue of excusing them \ndue to their ignorance, as it is possible one might refrain from making takfir of them out of his arrogance, defiance, following of desires, or citing of general texts indicating the merits of \u2018la ilaha illallah.\u2019 So the term takfir al-\u2018adhir does  not  accurately  describe  the  one  who  refrains  from making takfir of the mushrikin, such a refrainer being the one whom the scholars meant by this nullifier.\u201d\nThe memorandum continues, stating, \u201cThe one who refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam commits  an  agreed  upon  nullifier,  but  his  kufr  is  based upon establishment of the proof, unlike the one who worships others besides Allah. Making takfir of the mushrikin is  an  issue  established  by  apparent  and  numerous  texts, which all people can understand. Establishing the argument thereof is by the Quran\u2019s advent, by either it being conveyed to the people or them having the ability to reach it. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cSay, \u2018What thing is greatest in witness?\u2019 Say, \u2018Allah is a witness between me and you, and this Quran has been inspired unto me that by it I might warn you and whomever it reaches\u2019\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 19).\u201d\n\u201cThe mujaddid Shaykh Muhammad Ibn \u2018Abdil-Wahhab \uf072 said, \u2018Know that the evidences for making takfir of the otherwise righteous Muslim who commits shirk with Allah or sides with the mushrikin against the muwahaddin, even if he does not commit shirk, are more than one can compile from the speech of Allah,1 the words of His Messenger, and the statements of the scholars\u2019 (Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah). Shaykh \u2018Abdul-Latif Ibn \u2018Abdir-Rahman Ibn Hasan \uf073 said, \u2018It should be known that the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger, and the statements of  the  scholars  are  explicit,  abundant,  and  manifest  in making  takfir  of  anyone  who  supplicates  others  besides Allah and calls upon them for something only Allah can do \u2026 The entire Quran demonstrates and confirms this in various manners and expressions that explain this and make note of it\u2019 (Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah). Other scholars of the Najdi da\u2019wah said, \u2018The one who does not make takfir of the mushrikin has not accepted the teachings of the Quran to be true. The Quran has made takfir of the mushrikin and has ordered making takfir of them, taking them  as  enemies,  and  fighting  against  them\u2019  (Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah).\u201d\n\u201cHowever,  this  matter  could  become  somewhat  obscure with regards to some mushrikin who claim Islam, due to the spread of ignorance, the weakness of da\u2019wah, and the circulation of shubuhat. Here, the proof is established by demonstrating the clear texts evidencing the kufr of these mushrikin. If someone refrains after this clarification, he becomes a kafir. Shaykh Sulayman Ibn \u2018Abdillah \uf074 said, \u2018If someone doubts their kufr or is ignorant of it, the evidences proving their kufr from the Book of Allah 1   Editor\u2019s Note: Amongst these evidences are, \u201cThere has been for you an excellent example in Ibrahim and those with him, when they said to their people, \u2018Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship beside Allah. We reject your kufr. And enmity and animosity have forever emerged between us and you until you believe in Allah alone\u2019\u201d (Mumtahanah 4), as well as, \u201cSay, \u2018O kafirin, I do not worship what you worship, nor do you worship what I worship, nor do I worship in the manner you worship, nor do you worship in the manner I worship. You have your religion and I have mine!\u2019\u201d (Surat Al-Kafirun).\n\f", "schema:headline": "A Message from East Africa", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "1"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah2-Operations", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "2", "schema:articleBody": "As the soldiers of the Khilafah continue waging war on the forces of kufr, we take a glimpse at a number of recent operations conducted by the mujahidin of the Islamic State that have succeeded in expanding the territory of the Khilafah, or terrorizing, massacring, and humiliating the enemies of Allah. These operations are merely a selection of the numerous operations that the Islamic  State  has  conducted  on  various  fronts  across many regions over the course of the last few weeks.\nTarabulus Wilayah\nOn the 26th of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah, five istishhadi brothers \uf08d succeeded yesterday in detonating their explosive vehicles on positions of the murtadd Government of National Accord\u2019s militia in the city of Sirte, which resulted in the killing and wounding of hundreds, the destruction of four tanks, a BMP, and a number of armored vehicles mounted with machine guns. \nMeanwhile, a sixth istishhadi \uf08a succeeded in detonating his explosive vehicle on the murtaddin\u2019s rear positions in the area of Bu Hadi southeast of the city of Sirte. The operation resulted in the killing and wounding of dozens of murtaddin and the destruction of a number of their vehicles.\nOn the 16th of Dhul-Hijjah, approximately 30 fight-\n32\ners  belonging  to  the  murtadd  Government  of  National Accord\u2019s militia were killed and 50 others were wounded, and a BTR armored vehicle was destroyed following fierce clashes with the soldiers of the Khilafah in the area east of the city of Sirte.\n \nHalab Wilayah\nOn the 26th of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah, our istishhadi brother Abu Mu\u2019awiyah al-\u2018Iraqi \uf08a set out towards a gathering of PKK murtaddin in the village of Tall Hawdhan south of the city of Manbij. He detonated his explosive vehicle in their midst, killing approximately 40 of them and injuring dozens more.\n On the 16th of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah, approximately 60 American-vetted Sahwah fighters were killed and wounded and two of their 4-wheel drive vehicles mounted with American  machine  guns  and  a  57mm  artillery  cannon  were destroyed when they fell into a minefield in an attempt to advance on the mujahidin\u2019s positions in the villages of Jakkah and Talghar. This was after they had gathered approximately 40 vehicles, a number of Turkish army tanks, and  more  than  300  vetted  Sahwah  infantrymen,  in  addition to Crusader air support, only to retreat in defeat and humiliation, carrying away the corpses of their dead and licking their wounds. The mujahidin also succeeded in destroying a Turkish army tank after targeting it with \nNews\fa guided missile. This was followed by an istishhadi operation carried out by our brother Abu Mus\u2019ab ash-Shami \uf08a, who detonated his explosive vehicle in the midst of approximately 20 4-wheel drive vehicles and a number of murtadd infantrymen between the villages of East Tal\u2019ar and  West Tal\u2019ar,  turning  them  into  a  heap  of  scattered limbs. The mujahidin also detonated a series of explosive devices on those who survived as they attempted to flee. The event resulted in 38 murtaddin being killed and several more being injured, along with the destruction of 10 4-wheel drive vehicles.\nDuring the course of the following days, the soldiers of the Khilafah succeeded in driving out the vetted Sahwat from 8 villages east of the town Ra\u2019i and taking control of them. They included the villages of Sandi, Shaw Kabirah, Shaw Saghirah, Rawdah, Athariyyah, Ayyubiyyah, Nahdah, and Muthminah. This occurred following a stealth advance which was punctuated by clashes with the murtaddin, who quickly fled in defeat. The mujahidin then continued their advance and captured the villages of West Tal\u2019ar,  East Tal\u2019ar,  and  Kadrish  after  conducting  stealth operations, in addition to taking control of the village of Sandarah, west of Ra\u2019i in the northern countryside after driving out the vetted Sahwat and taking 4-wheel drive vehicles and a variety of weapons and ammo as ghanimah. Likewise,  three  inghimasiyyin  succeeded  in  recapturing the village of Buhurtah west of Ra\u2019i after killing a number of murtaddin.\nHims Wilayah\nOn the 27th of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah, the soldiers of the Khilafah carried out an attack on the Nusayri army\u2019s checkpoints  located  past Tallat  as-Sawwanah  near  the  area  of Huwaysis towards the east of the wilayah. They captured 11  checkpoints,  by  Allah\u2019s  grace,  following  clashes  in which several of the murtaddin were killed, and also took two 4-wheel drive vehicles as ghamimah, as well as a truck \nmounted with a 14.5mm machine gun, another mounted with a 37mm machine gun, an armored bulldozer, and a variety of weapons and ammo.\nDayala Wilayah\nOn the 29th of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah, the soldiers of the Khilafah launched an attack with various types of weapons on a Rafidi Mobilization barracks in Mutaybijah in the area of \u2018Adhim. Fierce clashes took place, during the course of which the mujahidin killed more than 50 murtaddin, injured dozens more, and took another two prisoner, in addition to burning 5 Hummers and a 4-wheel drive vehicle. They also captured a 4-wheel drive vehicle as ghanimah, as well as three 14.5mm machine guns, two 12.5mm machine guns, and a variety of weapons and ammo before returning safely back to their positions.\nDenmark\n \nOn  the  29th  of  Dhul-Qa\u2019dah,  a  soldier  of  the Khilafah  \u2013  our  brother  Mesa  Hodzik  \uf08a  \u2013  targeted  the Crusader police in Copenhagen in an operation which he carried out in response to the calls to target the nations that are members of the Crusader coalition waging war against  the  Muslims.\nSahil Wilayah\nOn the 3rd of Dhul-Hijjah, three soldiers of the Khilafah set out towards a Nusayri checkpoint at the Arzunah Bridge in Tartus where our brother Abu Ahmad ash-Shami \uf08a then detonated his explosive vehicle on the checkpoint, turning those present there into a heap of torn limbs. A security force then arrived to examine the area, and our istishhadi brothers Abu Ibrahim as-Sahili and Usamah al\u2018Iraqi \uf08d targeted them with their explosive jackets, killing and injuring dozens of murtaddin.\nThe devastating attack in Sahil shook the Nusayriyyah\n33\n\fSomalia\nOn the 15th of Dhul-Hijjah, the soldiers of the Khilafah launched an assault on a police station and checkpoint in the city Qof Judud, towards the west of Somalia.\nAmerica\nOn the 15th of Dhul-Hijjah, a soldier of the Khilafah \u2013 our brother Dahir Adan \uf08a \u2013 stabbed 10 kuffar in the state of Minnesota in response to the calls to target the citizens of the nations involved in the Crusader coalition.\nWest Africa Wilayah\nOn the 18th of Dhul-Hijjah, the soldiers of the Khilafah launched a fierce surprise attack on an African coalition convoy in the town of Malum Fatiri in Borno towards the northeast of Nigeria. The attack resulted in 40 Crusaders being killed and dozens more being injured, with those who remained alive fleeing in defeat, and the mujahidin seizing a large cache of weapons and equipment.\nDimashq Wilayah\nOn the 19th of Dhul-Hijjah, Islamic State air defense units shot down a Nusayri warplane that had carried out four  airstrikes  on  the  mujahidin\u2019s  locations  at  Mount Naqb  as  they  were  being  attacked  by  the  Sahwat.  The plane crashed between Nusayri territory and the territory of the vetted Sahwah factions, who then handed the pilot over to Nusayri forces after he had ejected and landed in the area of Sarrah near Mount al-Isharah. The handover of the pilot to the Nusayri army came after the Nusayri army agreed to requests previously made by the vetted Sahwat through  some  middlemen  from  the  \u201cnational  reconciliation\u201d for weapons and ammunition in order to replace what they\u2019d lost as a result of the Islamic State\u2019s attacks on their locations in East Qalamun in recent days. It\u2019s become widely known that the Nusayri army as of late has been launching airstrikes on a near-daily basis targeting Islamic State positions in East Qalamun and also bombarding them with heavy artillery shortly after the Khilafah\u2019s battles with the murtaddin. They have also, on several occasions, fired flares at night during the course of attacks launched  by  the  soldiers  of  the  Khilafah  on  these  locations.\nFurat Wilayah\nOn the 23rd of Dhul-Hijjah, a unit of Islamic State soldiers clashed with a joint force of Crusaders and murtaddin as they attempted to airdrop their forces using two American Chinook planes and four Apache helicopters on the road between Bayji and Hadithah near the village of Sakran. During the course of the clashes, the descending force fell into a field of mines planted by the soldiers of the Khilafah, and the clashes resulted in 10 murtaddin being killed and the joint force withdrawing in defeat.\nThe attack in Minnesota terrorized the Crusaders\nBaghdad Wilayah\nOn the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah, our istishhadi brothers Abu \u2018Aishah al-\u2018Iraqi and Abu Suhayb al-Falluji \uf08d succeeded in reaching a gathering of Rafidi mushrikin on Filastin Street in the middle of Baghdad where Abu \u2018Aishah detonated his explosive belt in their midst. He was followed by Abu Suhayb, who detonated his explosive vehicle on those of them who survived the first attack. The two blessed attacks resulted in approximately 40 murtaddin being killed and approximately 60 others being wounded.\nKenya\nOn the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah, three sisters who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State \u2013 Umm Ma\u2019bad, Umm Sa\u2019d, and Umm Maysarah \uf08e \u2013 attacked a police station in the city of Mombasa in support of the Islamic State, which is being targeted by the Crusader nations. The sisters entered the police station and attacked the personnel there with knives and a petrol bomb, injuring two Kenyan Crusader policemen before attaining shahadah when they were shot by the Crusader police.\nKhayr Wilayah\nOn  the  15th  of  Dhul-Hijjah,  a  unit  of  inghimasiyyin  set  out  in  the  direction  of  the  Nusayri  army\u2019s  artillery battalion base southwest of the city of Khayr. They clashed with them using various types of weapons and the murtaddin fled in retreat from the artillery battalion base, leading to the complete capture of Mount Thardah, which overlooks the city\u2019s military airbase.\nJust one day after the blessed operation, Islamic State air  defense  units  shot  down  a  Nusayri  warplane  in  the city of Khayr after targeting it with antiaircraft guns. The plane  was  destroyed  and  its  pilot,  the  Nusayri  criminal Colonel \u2018Ali Hamzah, was killed.\n34\nNews\f35\n\f36\nArticle\f37\n\f38\nArticle\f", "schema:headline": "Operations", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "31"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah7-Foreword", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "destroyed.\nThe  murtaddin  of  \u201cThe  Euphrates  Shield,\u201d  from the Turkish  army  and  the  Sahwah  factions,  do  not conceal the real goal behind their attacks against the Islamic State. That is, the removal of Allah\u2019s rule from the earth and the return of those lands under its governance to the rule of Jahiliyyah, by way of shirki courts of  man-made  legislation  in  their  various  forms  and names and with their different jahili laws that support them.\nHowever, what has been hidden from many people is the reality that on their way to achieving that objective, they are prepared to destroy everything and kill every person in those lands. This includes killing those residents whom they claim to be striving to liberate from the obligations of the religion and the lawfulness of the Shari\u2019ah. This is demonstrated by their constant declaration  that  any  area  they  attack  is  a  \u201cmilitary zone,\u201d paving the way for them to shell it with whatever they have of weaponry. Then, the reality of this matter became ever so clear in every village or town that defied them in the northern and eastern countrysides of Halab Wilayah, with the destructive and haphazard  bombardment  from  the  apostate Turkish army\u2019s artillery and aircraft, supported by Russian and American Crusader aircraft, without any care for the number of victims from the dozens of families they \nForeword\nLikewise, it is obscure to many people that these murtaddin are prepared, in order to achieve their objective, to assist any side in fighting against the Islamic State. Be it the criminal Nusayri regime, for whom they  have  claimed  to  have  enmity  for  years,  or  the Russian Crusader army, who continuously bombard the people of Sham, the same people whom they have supposedly come out in order to support and relieve from  oppression.  And  this  is  aside  from  their  assistance to the American Crusaders, whom \u2013 only a few short years ago \u2013 they considered a great demon, cursing them and whomever convened with them.\nIt is also obscure to them that much of the tears that have been shed during the past years for the people of Sham \u2013 who have suffered greatly, at the hands of the Nusayri army and its allies of the Rafidah and Russian Crusaders, in loss of life and the destruction of their cities and villages \u2013 were only shed with the goal of inciting the people against a specific \u201cenemy,\u201d the Nusayri regime and its Rafidi and Russian allies \u2013 and not against everyone who kills the Muslims of Sham, destroying their homes and masajid over their heads and the heads of their children.\nThe  battles  that  have  ensued  in  the  city  of  Bab, between the allies of Rahman \u2013 the soldiers of the Is-\n\fWe would not be exaggerating if we were to say that hundreds  of  movements,  parties,  and  factions  have arisen over the course of the past century claiming to be working for the return of the khilafah, the implementation of the Shari\u2019ah, and the establishment of the religion on the earth. However, they all failed to achieve that, despite some of them having reached a stage of either actual consolidation or pseudo-consolidation. Among them were those who even managed to establish some of the rulings of the Shari\u2019ah, but the  aforementioned  aspirations  were  never  achieved in their entirety except by the Islamic State, and virtue has and always will belong to Allah.\nIf we were to look at the condition of those movements we would find that most of them created obstacles  and  obstructions  for  themselves  that  either blocked the path in front of them or forcefully pushed them to deviate from the single, true path that would lead to the lofty goal to which they aspired. They burdened themselves with that which Allah had not burdened them with and obligated upon themselves that which Allah had not obligated upon them, regardless of  whether  they  were  those  who  tread  the  path  of harshness, ghuluww (extremism), and imposing that which Allah had not obligated on them, or those who tread  the  path  of  fleeing  from  the  shar\u2019i  rulings.  In both cases, they became distant from the straight path and the upright methodology for establishing the religion.\nCorrupt Absolutes\nOne of the main things that they burdened themselves with is that which they innovated of work methodologies which their leaders, theorists, and scholars put  in  place  for  them,  giving  them  names  such  as political  theories,  movement  methodologies,  or  the likes of that, referring to what they\u2019ve imposed of prerequisites that are necessary for achieving the results that  they  aim  for  with  their  work  and  their  movement, such that their perceptions and desires inspired to them methods of work that should be followed in order  to  reach  the  desired  goal  \u2013  the  establishment of  Allah\u2019s  religion  on  the  earth.  And  they  were  not content  with  merely  putting  forth  these  theories  or hypotheses. Rather, they made them out to be equal to the straight path with respect to working for the establishment of Allah\u2019s religion, as it was incorrect \u2013 in their view \u2013 to follow anything else in order to reach the goal. As a result, they tread the path of absolutes \nand  burdened  themselves  and  their  followers  with that which they could not bear and that which had not been obligated on them. Thus, they increased in misguidance, and Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient  people.\nThese suppositions were based on the notion that the path towards establishing the religion should involve  reaching  a  level-based  goal  or  surmounting a  major  obstacle,  and  that  without  achieving  either one or the other it wouldn\u2019t be possible \u2013 according to them \u2013 to establish the religion or to speak of an Islamic state, let alone establish a khilafah upon the prophetic methodology and a greater imamah for a unified  ummah.\nThe biggest problem with their hypotheses is that it generally isn\u2019t possible to establish the correctness or incorrectness of a hypothesis without first putting it to the test. So if the result of the experiment backs up the hypothesis, then it has thus been proven and can be considered a correct theory.

They therefore seek to  fill  the  vacuum  that  emerges  in  the  case  of  the American withdrawal, whether that is through a direct presence \u2013 and that is difficult and expensive \u2013 or by turning Khurasan into a safe zone which its allies oversee in order to prevent their enemies from having a presence in what they consider a dangerous region. \nThe nationalist Taliban movement represents an ideal model as that ally, due to its ambitions being confined to a nationalist Afghanistan, and due to its tribal and madhhabi fanaticism, and its strong relationship with the Rafidi government of Iran, the closest ally to Russia in these days.\nIndeed, this murtadd movement, with its proposal to fight the Islamic State on behalf of the Crusader nations and tawaghit governments, is merely repeating what many other organizations and factions falsely claiming Islam had done before them, such as the Sahwah factions of Iraq, and their likes from the Sahwat of Sham and Libya, which the al-Qa\u2019idah organization \u2013 who have bay\u2019ah to the nationalist Taliban movement  \u2013  are  allied  to.  The  fate  of  this  murtadd movement, which many were deceived by, won\u2019t differ from the fate of the Sahwat of Iraq and Sham, by Allah\u2019s permission, and their allies will search for a replacement for them once they discover their inability to prevent the soldiers of the Khilafah from reaching them and striking them in their lands. Rather, they will discover their inability to protect even themselves, and their need for their protection.\nSo  let  the  soldiers  of  the  Khilafah  in  Khurasan complete what they have begun by fighting the Crusaders  and  murtaddin,  and  let  them  intensify  their punishment of all the enemies of Allah \u2013 as is their custom \u2013 and let them support Allah with their words and deeds, for neither mankind nor the Jinn shall triumph  over  them  even  if  they  were  to  unite  against them.

They make it lawful one year and unlawful another year to correspond to the number made unlawful by Allah, so they make lawful what Allah has made unlawful. The evil of their deeds is made pleasing to them, and Allah does not guide the disbelieving people\u201d (At-Tawbah 37). Ibn Kathir \uf072 said, \u201c[In Jahiliyyah], a man from Bani Kinanah would come each year in the season (of Hajj),  riding  a  donkey.  He  would  say,  \u2018O  people!  I am not at fault nor questioned, and there is no response to what I say! We have forbidden Muharram and have postponed Safar.\u2019 He would then come the next year and say instead, \u2018We have forbidden Safar and have postponed Muharram,\u2019 which is His saying, \u2018to correspond to the number made unlawful by Allah,\u2019 meaning the four months, \u2018so they make lawful what  Allah  has  made  unlawful,\u2019  by  postponing  this sacred  month.\u201d\nThus, the mushrikin do not honor the rites of Allah, nor His prohibitions, but only play with the religion of Allah and ridicule it, legislating into the religion that which Allah never permitted, and thereby they disbelieve in the whole religion.

And expelling the people of al-Masjid al-Haram from it \u2013 as they expelled Muhammad g \u2013 is a greater sin than killing, according to Allah.\u201d\nIt is reported that Allah \uf062 has written for \u2018Abdullah Ibn Jahsh \uf068 and his companions the reward of the mujahid muhajirin for what they did. Ibn Ishaq said, \u201cWhen it was clear to \u2018Abdullah Ibn Jahsh and his  companions  the  good  that  they  did,  as  revealed in the Quran, they were hopeful of being rewarded. They said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah!

However,  the  truth  is  not  so. Their stance on this ruling was closer to mockery than esteem.  Whenever they found  it  difficult  to  cease fighting for three consecutive months, they resorted to something much greater in  sin  than  fighting:  they would  change  Allah\u2019s  ruling  and  legislate  over  His religion,  invoking  what  is known  as  the  \u201cnasi\u201d  (the postponing  of  a  month).

Then, the matter went even further as they opposed the ceasing of legislation in the religion with the death of the Prophet g, claiming that he specifically delegated his household with legislating many of the rulings that didn\u2019t occur in his lifetime and  therefore  didn\u2019t  require  that  he  speak  on  them, and that everything ascribed to their imams of words and deeds was in fact what they had inherited from the knowledge of prophethood.

The condition of these scholars is like that of the Jews about whom Allah \uf063 said, \u201cAmong  the  Jews  are  those  who  distort  words  from their [proper] usages\u201d (An-Nisa 46).\nKilling  the  kuffar  in  their  own  lands  or  stealing their wealth are among the issues widely discussed by the fuqaha. However, these taghut scholars promoted the fiqh of pacifism, strove to erase these issues from the  religion  of  Islam,  replace  them  with  the  manhaj of  humiliation  and  subservience  to  the  kuffar,  and subjugate the people to the new religion they had established, which was built on the foundation of \u201cthe peaceful co-existence of all religions,\u201d the solidification of \u201cthe principles of Islam,\u201d pacifism, and the abolishment of jihad.\nSuddenly,  you  find  many  of  those  who  associate themselves with knowledge and Islam almost agreeing on  prohibiting  a  matter  on  whose  permissibility  the Ummah  previously  had  ijma\u2019.  And  this  wouldn\u2019t  be strange if we were to reflect on the statement made by Anas Ibn Malik \uf068 when az-Zuhri entered upon him in Dimashq and said to him, \u201cWhat is it that is making you weep?\u201d So Anas said, \u201cI could not recognize anything [of the acts of worship] that I had come to witness except for the prayer, and now even the prayer has been lost\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari).\nSo how would it be if he were to have reached our era, in which clear rulings in the Book of Allah, the sunnah of Allah\u2019s Messenger g, and the ijma\u2019 of the Salaf have been wiped out? And among the rulings that have been done away with is the ruling on the blood and  wealth  of  the  harbi  (belligerent)  kuffar,  and  the fact that their blood does not have \u2018ismah (protection from being violated) except through their embracing of  Islam  or  through  a  covenant  that  is  valid  in  the Shari\u2019ah, and as such, it is permitted for the Muslim to shed their blood and take their wealth as he wishes, in accordance with the example of the Prophet g and his noble companions \uf073. But you find today that the scholars and the callers to misguidance criticize the muwahhidin and accuse them of distorting the image of Islam on account of the very deeds that were carried out by the Sahabah, such as Abu Basir and Abu Jandal \uf06b. And at the same time, you do not hear from them a single word when their masters from among the tawaghit of the West and the East loot the wealth of the Muslims. And indeed, the Islamic State has taken it upon its shoulders to wage jihad against the enemies of  this  religion  \u2013  from  among  the  kuffar  and  murtaddin \u2013 with sword and spear, and with proofs and \nclarifications until the religion is entirely for Allah and until there returns the Muslims their religion, clear and pure, as it had been before. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cAnd fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah. And if they cease - then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do\u201d (Al-Anfal 39).\nIn  this  article,  we  will  clarify  the  ruling  on  the wealth of the harbi kuffar in their lands, and demonstrate that what is taken from them can include that which is ghanimah, that which is fay, and that which is  talassus  and  ihtitab  (wealth  taken  through  fraud and deception). We will also mention the statements of some scholars on this subject and respond to some misconceptions. Likewise, we will not miss the opportunity to mention some of the benefits of taking their wealth in the framework of the comprehensive war between the Khilafah state and the nations of kufr altogether. And it is Allah who grants success and who guides to the straight path.\nThe Blood and Wealth of the Harbi Kafir Is \nPermissible to Violate\nThe default with regards to the blood and wealth of the harbi kuffar is that it does not have \u2018ismah. The scholars have an ijma\u2019 that the ruling of Allah concerning the harbi kuffar is that neither their blood nor their wealth has \u2018ismah. Rather, both their blood and wealth are permissible for the Muslims.\nImam Ibn Taymiyyah r said, \u201cAnd kufr alongside muharabah (belligerence) is present in every kafir, so it is permitted to enslave him just as it is permitted to kill him\u201d (Majmu\u2019 al-Fatawa).\nAnd  indeed,  the  harbi  kuffar  \u2013  according  to  the terminology of the fuqaha \u2013 are not only those kuffar who are at war with the Muslims. Rather, the harbi kuffar  include  all  those  to  whom  the  Muslims  have not granted security, either with a dhimmah contract, a covenant of security, or a ceasefire treaty, regardless of whether they are soldiers enlisted in the military, or non-combatants and others from among the common masses of the kuffar. Their blood and wealth is permissible for the Muslims, and this ruling encompasses all mushrikin  everywhere.  Allah \uf063  said,  \u201cThen  kill  the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and  give  zakah,  let  them  [go]  on  their  way.  Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful\u201d (At-Tawbah 5).

In truth, that is the one who is heedless, as was reported by Ibn \u2018Abbas h when he said, \u201cThe Prophet g said, \u2018There are two blessings which most people are heedless of: Heath and spare time\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari).\nO you who has been blessed with wealth and spare time, you who are distracted by your Dunya, you are indeed amongst those deprived,  for  you  did  not  give  true  value  to  the  time  that  has passed of your life, contrary to what is known of the people of high ambition, those who don\u2019t find any spare time due to their performance of deeds and their jihad, whereas you who has been blessed with spare time are headed towards a grave matter that may have been obscured from you and which you were heedless of, a moment in which you will say, \u201c\u2018O, I wish I had sent ahead [some good] for my life\u2019\u201d (Al-Fajr 24). Imam at-Tabari r said, \u201cAllah g says, while informing of the sorrow of the son of Adam on the Day of Judgment, and his regret over his negligence in performing righteous deeds in the Dunya which would have inherited him an eternal stay in bliss that has no end, O I wish I had sent ahead for my life in the world righteous deeds for myself in this life \u2013 after which there is no death \u2013 deeds that would have saved me from the anger of Allah and granted me His pleasure\u201d (Jami\u2019 al-Bayan).Indeed, there is he whom Allah has bestowed His blessings upon and thus sufficed with regards to the provisions of living, but he was careless, lost in heedlessness regarding the orders of his Lord, not busying his spare time in understanding his religion and what Allah demands of him. Rather, he was occupied with the haram, or excessiveness in that which is permissible. O confused \nand heedless one, prepare many answers for the many questions that are coming, for by Allah you were not created in play nor left without aim, and you shall be asked about your spare time and how you spent it.\nWith Every Day That Passes You, a Piece \nof You Departs\nFrom them is he who grows old and whose back becomes crooked while he possesses what would assist him in his worldly affairs of wealth and children, and Allah surely blessed him with such great blessings of spare time, but he did not know how take advantage of it. As for he whose situation is as such, reflect extensively about those years which you have spent while not attaining your share of the Hereafter. Reflect on how close you are to meeting your Lord. Is now not the time for you to incite your children and descendants to sacrifice for the religion of Allah and support it? Is now not the time for you to dedicate your time  to  Allah  and  to  supplicating  for  yourself, the oppressed Muslims, and the mujahid slaves of Allah? Is now not the time to devote yourself to  Allah  and  draw  closer  to  Him  through  the various methods of drawing oneself close.\nThere are many people who reach a very old age,  and  then  you  find  them  living  with  the absent-minded mentality of the youth, those who don\u2019t think about death, the hour of questioning and  account,  and  by  Allah,  that  is  in  reality nothing but high expectations of living a long life and it is the essence of destruction. So where are you in relation to the statement of Allah g, \u201cAnd there has come the intoxication of death with the truth; that is what you were trying to avoid\u201d (Qaf 19)? Imam al-Baghawi said, \u201c\u2018And there has come the intoxication of death\u2019: pains and agonies that envelope mankind and overcome his mind, \u2018with the truth\u2019: meaning the reality of death. And it was said, \u2018with the truth\u2019: meaning the matter of the Hereafter, such that mankind sees it clearly with his own eyes. And it was said: with what the affair of mankind returns to of either bliss or misery. And it is said to the one whom the intoxication of death has come to: \u2018that is what you  were  trying  to  avoid\u2019:  incline  away  from, and al-Hasan al-Basri said: to flee from, and Ibn \u2018Abbas said: [that is what you] hate\u201d (Ma\u2019alim at-\nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "The Rule of the Shari'ah Not the Rule of Jahiliyyah", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "5"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3-Sultan-Mahmud-al-Ghaznawi", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "3", "schema:articleBody": "The breaking and burning of idols is a major aspect of rejecting taghut and something that the prophets all practiced. Among the famous examples was that of Ibrahim \uf06e, who smashed the idols of his people with an axe, and Musa \uf06e, who melted the gold calf worshiped  by  Bani  Israil.  Likewise,  the  Seal  of  the Prophets,  Muhammad \uf06d,  destroyed  the  Arab  idols in Makkah, burning and demolishing al-Lat, al-\u2018Uzza, Manat, Hubal, and others. Thereafter, the Sahabah and the Tabi\u2019in treaded that same path, as do those today who follow that same guidance.\nWe  also  find  in  the  later  history  of  the  Muslim Ummah those who followed the prophets \uf070 by making the destruction of mushrik idols their greatest priority in life. They strove to that end and fought for it, crossing great deserts and confronting many perils in order to reach this goal. Among them was the warrior Mahmud Ibn Subuktikin \uf072, whom people nicknamed \u201cthe Breaker of Idols\u201d due to the numerous and significant idols he destroyed. This was only one of his many great traits, as he was also known for supporting the  Sunnah,  subduing  bid\u2019ah  (heretical  innovation), and bringing unity to the Muslims by pledging bay\u2019ah to the \u2018Abbasi khalifah and obeying him.\nSultan Mahmud Ibn Subuktikin was born in Muharram  of  the  year  360AH  in  the  city  of  Ghaznah, Khurasan. He became the ruler of the land after the death of his father in the year 387AH, thereafter devoting himself to waging jihad against the mushrikin of India, destroying their idols, and spreading Islam in  their  lands.  It  was  in  the  year  396AH  that  this Sultan Mahmud al-Ghaznawi marched to the fort of Kawakir, which housed six hundred pagan idols. After conquering the fort, he burned all of the idols therein (Ibnul-Athir:  Al-Kamil).\nIn the year 398AH, al-Ghaznawi returned to raiding India. Ibnul-Athir said, \u201cHe reached the banks of the Indus River and was met there by Anandapala [the Indian king] with the armies of India. They fought all day until it seemed that the Indians would defeat the Muslims, but then Allah \uf063 supported him over them. The Muslims defeated the Indians and sent them fleeing or killed them by the sword. Yamin ad-Dawlah [i.e. al-Ghaznawi] followed Anandapala to the fort at Bahim Naghar, which was on a high mountain. The fort was taken by the Indians as a treasury for one of their largest idols\u2026 When the Indians saw the magnitude of his force, their sheer desire to fight, and their continuous march towards them, they were taken by \n36Article\nfear and cowardice, requested amnesty, and opened the gate of the fortress. The Muslims took control of the fort and Yamin ad-Dawlah  ascended,  along  with  his  closest  companions  and trusted friends, and collected an undefined amount of jewels, as well as ninety million Shahi dirhams\u201d (Al-Kamil). Thus, Allah humiliated the mushrikin and their tawaghit. Their idols were destroyed  and  the  Muslims  seized  all  that  was  offered  to  the largest idol of India of precious metals and jewels.\nThe  Sultan  did  the  same  in  400AH,  marching  into  India, pillaging it, and destroying the idols therein. In the year 405AH,  he  marched  on  Thanesar.  Ibnul-Athir  said,  \u201cWhen they came near their destination, they found a river with a fast current, which would be difficult to ford, and the leader of those lands stood on its banks to prevent anyone from crossing, having his soldiery and war elephants with him for this task. Yamin ad-Dawlah then ordered the bravest of his army to cross the river and engage the kuffar with combat, which they did, in order to allow the rest of the army to cross. They fought the Indians and kept them engaged until the rest of the army managed to ford the then undefended river and fought then on all fronts for the rest of the day. The Indians were defeated, the Muslims were victorious, and they seized what the enemy brought of wealth and elephants.\u201d\nArticle\fand  relatives.  As  for  her  going  out  becoming  a  habitual,  regular  practice,  then  such  is  at  variance  with  the Shari\u2019ah by diverging from the default rule, which is that women should stay home.\nIn  this  regards,  the  Muslim  woman  should  consider the hadith of the Prophet \uf067, in which he said, \u201cDo not  prevent  your  women  from  the  masajid,  however, their homes are better for them\u201d (Reported by Ahmad, Abu  Dawud,  Ibn  Khuzaymah,  al-Hakim,  and  ad-Diya from Ibn \u2018Umar). The masjid is the house of Allah and the most beloved of places to Him \uf063, and prayer is the pillar of the religion, yet the Shari\u2019ah does not require that women pray in congregation, which has been made obligatory on men. But instead, it has made her prayer in her home better for her than going out to witness the congregational  prayer  in  the  masjid.  Indeed,  this  is  to further safeguard the woman and shield her from view as much as possible. The Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cThe woman is \u2018awrah [something that should be covered]. When she goes out, Shaytan stares at her [or adorns her]. And she is closest to Allah when she is inside her home\u201d (Reported by Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban from Ibn Mas\u2019ud).The Muslim woman who is veiled in accordance with the  Shari\u2019ah  should  not  assume  that  her  veil  distances her from this hadith or that the woman is only \u2018awrah when  she  is  unveiled  or  adorned.  Rather  she  is  \u2018awrah whenever she leaves her home, even if she is not revealing anything of herself. May Allah have mercy upon the great Tabi\u2019i  Sufyan  ath-Thawri  \uf072,  who  said,  \u201cThere  is nothing better for a woman than her home, even if she is very old\u201d (At-Tahawi: Mukhtasar Ikhtilaf al-\u2018Ulama).Simply leaving her home could be a fitnah for her, for those men who see her, or for both her and the men, especially if she speaks with them. For this reason, Allah \uf063 said to the wives of the Prophet \uf067, \u201cSo do not be soft in speech, lest someone with a disease in his heart becomes desirous\u201d (Al-Ahzab 32), and being soft in speech means to speak weakly with a soft voice, the result of which is that \u201csomeone with a disease in his heart becomes desirous.\u201d If this is said of someone in the generation of the Prophet \uf067 and his noble companions \uf06a, which was the best of generations, then what about in our time, a time of fitan and grievous sin? Indeed, \u2018Amrah narrated that \u2018Aishah \uf069 said, \u201cIf Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 saw what women have devised, he would prevent them from going to the masjid just as the women of Bani Israil were prevented.\u201d \u2018Amrah was then asked, \u201cWere [the women of Bani Israil] prevented from going to the masjid?\u201d He replied, \u201cYes\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nSubhanallah! This is what \u2018Aishah \u2013 the scholar of fiqh and  hadith  \uf069  \u2013  concluded  based  on  what  she  saw  of innovations and transgressions from some of the women in her era. What if she were to have witnessed our time?! Rather, what if the Prophet \uf067 were to see what the women of today \u2013 other than those whom Allah has saved \u2013 are doing?!\nThose who like to wander about the pasturelands of shubuhat (doubtful matters) should place the aforementioned statement of Umm al-Muminin \u2018Aishah directly in  front  of  their  eyes  when  they  give  fatawa  regarding \nrulings related to women, fatawa that have caused women to leave their homes without any regulations, for no need, benefit, or necessity, even multitudes of times in a single day, rather, even if she were in \u2018iddah, mourning a husband who has passed away!\nImam Ahmad \uf072 was asked about women going out for the two Eids, to which he replied, \u201cI do not like that.\u201d Ibnul-Mubarak  \uf072  said,  \u201cI  dislike  that  women  go  out these  days  during  the  two  Eids\u201d  (At-Tirmidhi:  As-Sunan).  Abu  Hanifah  said,  \u201cWomen  were  allowed  to  go out to the Eid prayers. As for today, I dislike that they do so\u201d (Ibn \u2018Abdil-Barr: At-Tamhid).1\nIf these fuqaha \u2013 for the sake of repelling evils they perceived  then  \u2013  disliked  a  woman\u2019s  going  out  to  perform  a  great  deed  in  Islam,  how  about  her  going  out time and again in our era, until she becomes infamous for  doing  so?\nAllah \uf063 described the Hur al-\u2018In in the Quran as \u201crestricted to pavilions\u201d (Ar-Rahman 72). Al-Qurtubi said, \u201cHis saying \u2018restricted\u2019 means confined and covered, and \u2018to  pavilions\u2019  means  dome-like  compartments  covered with cloth. These women do not wander the streets. This is what Ibn \u2018Abbas said.\u201d The Jannah is perfect, containing no fitnah, no perversion, and no deviance, and yet the  Hur  are  restricted  to  pavilions  for  their  husbands, who will be the only ones who see them.\nFinally,  the  Muslim  man  must  remember  that  his wives are part of his flock, for whom he is responsible. The man should not let his wife have free rein in this regards. Instead, he can prevent her if she goes out too often. May Allah be pleased with \u2018Umar, who would have prevented one of his wives from going to the masjid, due to his protective jealousy for her, if it were not for the hadith  of  the  Prophet  \uf067  against  doing  so.  Ibn  \u2018Umar \uf068  narrated,  \u201cOne  of  \u2018Umar\u2019s  women  would  pray  the Fajr and \u2018Isha prayers in the masjid, so it was said to her, \u2018Why do you go out, while you know that \u2018Umar dislikes so and is jealous?\u2019 She said, \u2018Why does he not forbid me then?\u2019  They  said,  \u2018What  prevents  him  is  the  saying  of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067, \u2018Do not prevent the maidservants of  Allah  from  the  masajid  of  Allah\u2019\u201d  (Reported  by  alBukhari and Muslim).\nYes,  there  is  nothing  wrong  with  Muslim  women visiting each other, nor with keeping families ties, nor with her going to the market. However, nothing should be  done  in  excess.  Going  out  should  be  occasional  in comparison to the default rule, which is that she stays at home. The believing woman in her own room is the closest she can be to her Lord in this life, and all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the creation.\n1      None  of  them  disliked  the  allowance  given  by  Allah  in  the Shari\u2019ah, but they disliked what the women of their times were doing with the allowance. If this was the condition of women then, how  much  more  is  their  worry  applicable  now?\n\f", "schema:headline": "Sultan Mahmud al-Ghaznawi", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "35"}, {"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)", "@type": "schema:Article"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5-Collateral-Carnage", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "5", "schema:articleBody": "Allah  \uf062  revealed  the  Shari\u2019ah  to  the  Prophet \uf067, giving people a complete way to live their lives. Unlike man-made systems, the law of the Shari\u2019ah is divine and flawless. There is no doubt in its authority and no suspicion of its perfection. Allah \uf062 said, \u201cWe have not neglected anything in the Book\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 38). Likewise, He said, \u201cDo that which is good\u201d (Al-Hajj 77), showing that anything Allah commands is good and its outcome should not be regretted.\nAllah \uf066 has ordered the killing of all mushrikin1 \u2013 whether military or civilian \u2013 in His saying, \u201cThen kill the mushrikin wherever you find them\u201d (At-Tawbah 5), which was reiterated by the Prophet \uf067, who said, \u201cI have been ordered to fight mankind until they testify that nothing is worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah\u2026\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar). Like many other rulings in the Shari\u2019ah, this general obligation to kill the mushrikin has its specific  exceptions,  among  which  is  women  and children. In one of the Prophet\u2019s raids, a woman was found killed, upon which he \uf067 denounced and for-\n1   For more, see Rumiyah, issue 1, \u201cThe Kafir\u2019s Blood Is Halal for You, So Shed It.\u201d\nbade the killing of women and children (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar), thereby setting the principle of prohibition in this issue.Commenting on this principle, ash-Shafi\u2019i said, \u201cOur opinion regarding this \u2013 and Allah knows best \u2013 is that the restriction exists so that they can become slaves, which is more beneficial than killing them\u201d (Al-Umm). This is supported by the statement of the Prophet \uf067, \u201cAllah dislikes that you do three things: gossiping, excessive questioning, and wasting wealth\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim  from  al-Mughirah  Ibn  Shu\u2019bah),  and  women and children of the uncovenanted kuffar are wealth \u2013 and wasted if killed.\nHowever, this principle also has its exceptions. There  is  no  disagreement  amongst  Muslims  that women are eligible to be killed for crimes like murder and adultery. Likewise, both women and children  who  participate  in  fighting  against  Muslims are exempted from this prohibition. That is, killing those women and children who participate in the war against Muslims is not forbidden \u2013 but rather even necessary. Ibn Battal said, \u201cThe majority agreed that women and children who fight are to be killed, and  such  is  the  opinion  of  Malik,  al-Layth,  Abu Hanifah, ath-Thawri, al-Awza\u2019i, ash-Shafi\u2019i, Ahmad, \n6Exclusive\nArticle\fand readily accessible materials (i.e. flammables), one can easily terrorize an entire nation. This is a quick option for anyone intending to join the just terror campaign.\nArson,  as  it  applies  to  the  just  terror  mujahid,  is  to initiate fires by using flammables to destroy the property of the Crusaders and, in some cases, kill several of them, sending them from the fire of this world to the inferno of Hellfire.1 All that is required of the mujahid is to acquire the flammable he wishes to use, select his target, and determine the best time for execution.\nBecause many flammables are a part of everyday living, arson attacks are extremely difficult to prevent. Indeed, no more than a large container of gasoline (petrol) is needed for a successful attack. Of course, the gasoline can be acquired from any local gas station, where it is filled into the container. This procedure should not arouse any suspicion, as it is quite common to follow, especially when obtaining gas for a lawnmower, amongst other reasons.\nHow to Make a Molotov Cocktail and Napalm\nMolotov cocktails are infamous for wreaking destruction with minimal effort and can be useful in an extended arson  campaign  against  the  Crusader  enemy.  Moreover, preparing a Molotov cocktail is a simple procedure requiring very basic and easily attainable components, these being:\n-  a large gasoline container-  a funnel-  a medium-sized empty glass bottle-  a piece of cloth, or a rag, or paper towels-  enough gas to almost fill the glass bottle-  a working lighter or matches to ignite the Molotov before launching it at the target\nSteps for Making a Molotov Cocktail\nFirst, the empty glass bottle is filled with gasoline using a funnel, leaving only a small space unfilled. The piece of cloth is then inserted into the bottle, all the way to the bottom, so that it can soak in the gasoline, while the other end of the cloth protrudes through the bottle\u2019s mouth, enough so as to set it alight without any difficulty. The protruding end should also be soaked in gasoline, to allow for quick ignition when lit. The bottle\u2019s mouth must then \n1   Note that the Prophet\u2019s \uf067 saying, \u201cDo not punish with the punishment of Allah\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Ibn \u2018Abbas) refers to using fire as a punishment against prisoners, unless they had a role in the burning of Muslims, in which case, the prisoners can be burned retributively; see \u201cThe Flames of Justice\u201d in this issue of Rumiyah. Likewise, the usage of fire is permissible in open combat and covert operations, as the Prophet \uf067 burned down the date palm trees of Bani an-Nadir while  besieging  them,  causing  widespread  fire  thereby  (Reported  by al-Bukhari from Ibn \u2018Umar). This ruling is supported by the opinion of the majority of scholars, who hold the ruling on using fire against the unsubdued enemy to be like that on killing the enemy\u2019s women and children collaterally by way of catapults, night raids, etc., which is permissible; see \u201cCollateral Carnage\u201d in this issue of Rumiyah. How much more of a necessity is \u201cfire\u201d today in combat and covert ops with almost all modern weaponry utilizing intense heat and explosions to hurt and kill the enemy?\nbe sealed, not allowing any gasoline to spill. This can be done by firmly reapplying the bottle\u2019s lid, or plugging its mouth  with  a  cork  plug  cut  to  the  required  size,  or  by securely taping up the bottle mouth using strong electrical (insulating) tape and an appropriately sized piece of a plastic bag.\nDue to the fast rate at which gasoline burns away, it is better that one transforms the contents of his Molotov cocktail  into  a  sticky,  long-burning  napalm  solution,  to ensure \u2013 by Allah\u2019s permission \u2013 that the intended target properly catches fire before the gas finishes burning.\nSteps for Making a Napalm Molotov Cocktail\nAll  that  is  required  are  pieces  of  polystyrene  (Styrofoam), which is commonly found in boxed packaging of children\u2019s toys and household appliances or in the form of foam cups used for hot coffee at donut shops. One only has to pack the pieces of crushed foam inside the bottle (two thirds of which is filled with gasoline), gently shaking it, until the polystyrene dissolves, turning the mixture into a thick solution. He should continue adding polystyrene until the desired sticky glue-type consistency is reached. This stickiness will assist in allowing the area of the Molotov cocktail\u2019s impact to burn for a longer period. Alternatively, instead of Styrofoam, one can add liquid laundry detergent or dishwashing liquid in the same manner, to thicken  the  gasoline  and  slow  its  burning.  The  piece  of cloth is then inserted into the bottle, the protruding end should be soaked in gasoline, and the bottle\u2019s mouth must then be sealed as explained before. Also, the exterior of the bottle should be cleansed of any napalm.\nAdditionally, if needed for the arson attack, the mixture can be prepared and stored in a larger container and poured directly on the intended target before lighting the fire.\nHow to Use the Molotov Cocktail\nThe mechanism of the Molotov cocktail is simple. It is not an explosive requiring a detonator. Rather, once a naked flame makes contact with the solution inside the glass bottle, ignition occurs. Therefore, the Molotov cocktail should be launched at a hard surface of the intended target,  shortly  after  lighting  the  protruding  cloth.  This will cause the glass bottle to smash, allowing the enflamed cloth to make contact with the flammable solution contained inside the bottle, igniting it and whatever the solution makes contact with.\nIdeal Target Locations\nIdeal  target  locations  for  arson  include  houses  and apartment buildings, forest areas adjacent to residential areas, factories that produce cars, furniture, clothing, flammable substances, etc., gas stations, hospitals, bars, dance clubs,  night  clubs,  banks,  car  showrooms,  schools,  universities, as well as churches, Rafidi temples, and so forth. The options are vast, leaving no excuse for delay.\n\f", "schema:headline": "Collateral Carnage", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "5"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah9-The-Ruling-on-the-Belligerent-Christians", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "9", "schema:articleBody": "Feature\n\ftilated his body.

And whoever laid himself bare to carry the word, \u201cLa ilaha illallah,\u201d supporting it and establishing it on the earth, then he must pay the price of this honor, which is exhaustion, fatigue, and being tested.\nSo where are you in relation to this?

This kind of \nbeing tested is the common denominator between all of them. Allah c said, \u201cBlessed is He in whose hand is dominion, and He is over all things competent; He who created death and life to test you as to which of you is best in deed \u2013 and He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving\u201d (Al-Mulk 1-2).\nThe Prophet g narrated that his Lord b said, \u201cI only sent you so that I would test you and that others would be tested by you\u201d (Reported by Muslim from \u2018Iyad Ibn Himar).\nWhat  we  have  learned  from  the  Quran  and  the Sunnah is that some of the prophets were killed and mutilated  by  their  enemies,  like Yahya n,  and  that some of their people attempted to kill them, but they came out unharmed, like Ibrahim, who emigrated to Sham, and \u2018Isa, who was raised to the heavens.\nWe  find  some  believers  are  faced  with  the  worst kinds of torture; some were thrown into fiery trenches, some were martyred, and others continue to live in anguish, suffering, and oppression.

And  as  such  Allah  brings  forth  from  the \n44SHUHADA\nSHUHADA\fO patient mujahid anticipating his reward, these words were written in order that you recognize your worth and value in the sight of the enemies of Allah and your enemies, for the various nations have gathered against you along with the races of the Arabs and non-Arabs.\nSo who are you, O lofty mountain, who are you that the Crusaders should anchor their battleships in the seas, and that the kafir warplanes should patrol your skies, and that the debauched assemblies should roam your lands?\nWho are you, O you who takes honor from his religion  and  his  tawhid,  that  they  should  gather against you all of these assemblies and besiege with all its ability, a land that is ruled by Allah\u2019s shari\u2019ah and  defends  its  sanctities?  You  have  been  elevated by Allah\u2019s honor, strength, and His exalted shari\u2019ah, and what you are upon of tawhid grieved the kuffar due to the envy they foster within themselves.\nFor if you were to possess the land but your state did not rule by Allah\u2019s shari\u2019ah they wouldn\u2019t have paid you any mind, but it is your tawhid that enrages them. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cMany of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from themselves [even] after the truth has become apparent to them\u201d (Al-Baqarah  109).  And  so  they  sought  to  respond to this abominable envy by fighting you, and thus their fighting was on account of your religion which you carried in your heart and upon your limbs. Allah  \uf063  said,  \u201cAnd  they  will  continue  to  fight  you until they turn you back from your religion if they are able\u201d (Al-Baqarah 217).\nIf  you  possessed  weapons  of  mass  destruction and did not possess this great religion they would have  left  you  alone  as  they  left  alone  states  that possess  them  or  strive  to  possess  them,  but  rather, they knew that your religion which is prevalent through your severe fighting of their tawaghit and their armies is greater than any weapon they possess. They therefore have not previously granted you \u2013 nor will they ever grant you \u2013 respite for a single moment, nor will they disengage from fighting you or showing enmity towards you. So either it is their rule on the earth and the fitnah of shirk which they seek  to  transmit,  or  it  is  the  sovereignty  of  Allah and the supremacy of His religion on the earth.\nSo be truthful to Allah in your jihad, O enemy of the nations, and revere Him and do not revere anyone else besides Him, for the despair of the kafir \nfrom your religion is an absolute certainty. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cThis day those who disbelieve have despaired of [defeating] your religion; so fear them not, but fear Me\u201d (Al-Maidah 3).\nO  muwahhid  stranger,  indeed  you  are  a  target regardless  of  your  status,  whether  you  were  a  soldier or a leader, and whether you were poor or rich, because the reason for you being targeted is due to your religion which the kuffar know you have embraced in its entirety, and the fact that you don\u2019t believe in only a portion of it while rejecting another portion so that you could meet with them on some sort of middle ground.\nAnd likewise, that is your condition, O patient muwahhidah,  for  indeed  you  are  chaste  and  increase the offspring of the mujahidin and nurture your  children  upon  tawhid  and  jihad  against  the kuffar,  and  so  your  religion  and  purity  enrages them. Therefore, it is of no surprise that you would be  a  specific  target  for  the  kuffar.\nWe are engaged in a long struggle with the kuffar,  and  success  and  victory  for  the  muttaqin  is guaranteed, for Allah \uf063 has said, \u201cAnd the [best] outcome  is  for  the  righteous\u201d  (Al-A\u2019raf  128),  and He \uf063 said, \u201cAnd [that] indeed, Our soldiers will be those prevalent\u201d (As-Saffat 173), for either you are prevalent in this worldly life by dominance and triumph over the kuffar, or victorious through being killed in Allah\u2019s cause, obtaining through it a blissful abode with the generous Lord, while your enemies are in constant loss, and rage causes them to exhaust their strength in order to hinder the people from Allah\u2019s path through their spending of wealth and through fighting, and through other than that from the fleeting ornaments of this world.\nTherefore,  O  honorable  and  defiant  one  in  the era  of  epic  battles,  proceed  and  don\u2019t  look  back for you were not created for the sake of a transient earth.

Their sinful tongues and filthy pens even go so far as to give those harbi (belligerent) kuffar  protection  with  respect  to  their  blood  and  their wealth,  and  to  defame  the  noble  muwahhidin,  who carried out Allah\u2019s judgment on the mushrikin and, through their blessed deeds \u2013 not just their words \u2013 revived shar\u2019i rulings which the tawaghit and their allies endeavored to either wipe out or replace.\nFrom among these blessed deeds were the successive attacks which the soldiers of the Islamic State in Misr1 and Sinai carried out against the Christians in those  lands,  targeting  them  with  killings  and  assassinations, and afflicting their churches with burning and  explosions.  Thus,  they  brought  upon  them  tremendous detriment and deepened their wounds. The last of the blessed attacks against them were the simultaneous  explosions  at  two  of  their  largest  churches, one in northern Misr and the other in southern Misr, in the cities of Alexandria and Tanta on their holiday on the 12th of the month of Rajab in the year 1438. More than 200 of the Christian mushrikin and their supporters  from  among  the  murtadd  soldiers  of  the taghut were killed and wounded, and to Allah belongs all praise.\nIn this brief article we will attempt to shed light on the condition of the Christians in Misr, as well as the ruling of Islam concerning their blood, their wealth, their honor, and their churches, so that those who live may  live  upon  evidence  and  those  who  perish  may perish upon evidence. And it is Allah who guides to the straight path.\nSo Kill the Mushrikin Wherever You Find Them\nThe default with regards to the blood of mushrikin is that it is permissible to shed, due to the statement of \n1  Misr is the Arabic name for the land commonly known as Egypt.\nAllah c, \u201cAnd when the sacred months have passed, then kill the musrhikin wherever you find them and capture  them  and  besiege  them  and  sit  in  wait  for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful\u201d (At-Tawbah 5). Committing shirk with Allah is a sin that makes one permissible to be killed, and believing in Him gives one protection, as the Prophet g said, \u201cI was commanded to fight the people until they say \u2018La  ilaha  illallah,\u2019  so  whoever  says  \u2018La  ilaha  illallah\u2019 has protected from me his wealth and his life except by its right (i.e. by the right of \u2018La ilaha illallah\u2019) and his reckoning is upon Allah\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nThe mushrikin cannot render their blood inviolable except through a dhimmah contract, or a covenant of security or safety. The inviolability of their blood in such cases would be an exceptional ruling, and whenever that ruling is terminated \u2013 either due to their violation of the covenant, or due to the expiry of the duration of the covenant of security or safety \u2013 their blood  would  go  back  to  the  default  ruling  of  it  being permissible to shed, and there is no disagreement among the Muslims in that regard.\nNo Protection for Their Blood Except through \nFaith or a Covenant of Security\nThe Christians in Misr and in other lands of the Muslims  are  from  among  those  for  whom  Allah  c permitted  that  they  protect  their  blood  by  entering under  the  dhimmah  (liability)  of  the  Muslims  and paying the jizyah in humiliation, due to the statement of Allah c, \u201cFight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture \u2013 [fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled\u201d (At-Tawbah 29).\nIf they do that, then their blood, wealth, and honor become  protected  except  by  the  right  of  Islam,  and there are many, well-known texts which emphasize the inviolability of the blood of the mu\u2019ahadin (those with covenants  of  security),  the  dhimmiyyin  (those  with contracts  of  dhimmah),  and  those  with  covenants of safety. From among them is the statement of the Prophet g, \u201cWhoever kills a person who\u2019s been given a covenant will not smell the fragrance of Jannah, and \n\f", "schema:headline": "Contents", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "1"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah2-Just-Terror-Tactics", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "2", "schema:articleBody": "the striking of the enemy in war. However, any such squirms and discomforts are never an excuse for abandoning jihad, as the All-Knowing and  Most  Wise  said,  \u201cFighting  has  been  enjoined upon you while it contains that which you dislike. But perhaps you dislike a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah knows, while you know not\u201d (Al-Baqarah 216). In compliance with this and other verses on jihad, generations  upon  generations  of  mujahidin  rose for the sake of Allah \uf065 and struck the necks of the kuffar with their swords, severing limbs and piercing the fleshy meat of those who opposed  Islam.  \u201cSo  when  you  meet  those  who disbelieve, strike their necks, until, when you have overwhelmed them with killing \u2026\u201d (Muhammad 4).\nThe knife was a weapon with which the Sahabah \uf06a were well acquainted. \u2018Abdur-Razzaq as-San\u2019ani reported in his musannaf that a dagger, a type of knife, was the weapon used by Muhammad Ibn Maslamah \uf068 in the assassination of the Jewish taghut Ka\u2019b Ibn al-Ashraf, whom Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 ordered be killed.One might ask why knives are a good option for an attack. Knives, though certainly not the only weapon for inflicting harm upon the kuffar,  are  widely  available  in  every  land  and \nWhen considering a just terror operation,1 an ocean of thoughts might pour into one\u2019s mind, clouding the ability to make a final decision. Whether in regards to the type of operation one seeks to conduct or the details of that operation, it is easy for someone to be defeated by doubt if they have not received proper guidance or training. Yet, one need not be a military expert or a martial arts master, or even own a gun or rifle in order to carry out a massacre or to kill and injure several disbelievers and terrorize an entire nation. A hardened resolve, some basic planning, and reliance on Allah for success are enough for a single mujahid to bring untold misery to the enemies of Allah, in shaallah.\nKnife Attacks\nMany people are often squeamish of the thought of plunging a sharp object into another person\u2019s flesh. It is a discomfort caused by the untamed, inherent dislike for pain and death, especially after \u201cmodernization\u201d distanced males from partaking in the slaughtering of livestock for food and \n1   Instead of using the term \u201clone wolf,\u201d we will refer to operations in Dar al-Kufr executed by mujahidin with bay\u2019ah to the Khalifah \uf085 as \u201cjust terror operations,\u201d \u201cjust\u201d being the adjective form for justice. \n12Exclusive\nExclusive\fDay of Judgment, nor look at him, nor purify him, and he would have a tormenting punishment, losing thereby both the Dunya and the Akhirah, and that is the clear loss. As for the blessing of the Jama\u2019ah, the blessing of succession to authority in the land, the blessing of consolidation for the religion, then without this, the individual is overpowered and afflicted with trials and calamities until the wolves devour him and he then dies a death of Jahiliyyah, and Allah\u2019s refuge is sought.\nAs for His statement, \u201cthen mention it,\u201d \u2018Umar Ibn \u2018Abdil-\u2018Aziz \uf072 (d. 101AH) said, \u201cMentioning a blessing is a part of being grateful.\u201d Al-Jariri (d. 144AH) and Yahya Ibn Sa\u2019id (d. 143AH) \uf074 said, \u201cIt used to be said that counting blessings was a part of being grateful.\u2019\u201d Qatadah \uf072 (d. 118AH) said, \u201cSpreading good news of a blessing is part of being grateful for it.\u201d Al-Fudayl Ibn \u2018Iyad \uf072 (d. 187AH) said, \u201cIt used to be said that talking about a blessing was part of being grateful for it.\u201d Al-Hasan Ibn \u2018Ali \uf06b said, \u201cIf you  acquire  good,  then  tell  your  brothers.\u201d  Abu  Nadrah \uf072 (d. 108AH) said, \u201cThe Muslims used to consider that speaking about a blessing was part of being grateful for it.\u201d Ibn Abil-Hawari \uf072 said, \u201cAl-Fudayl Ibn \u2018Iyad and Sufy\u0101n Ibn  \u2018Uyaynah  (d.  199AH)  sat  one  night  until  morning mentioning their blessings. Sufyan kept saying, \u2018Allah has blessed us in such-and-such. Allah has blessed us in suchand-such. He has done such-and-such for us. He has done such-and-such for us.\u2019\u201d\nIt was reported that the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever does not show gratitude for what is little, has not shown gratitude for what is much. And whoever does not thank the people, has not thanked Allah. Mentioning Allah\u2019s blessing is a part of gratefulness, and to abandon doing so is from ungratefulness.  The  Jama\u2019ah  is  a  mercy,  and  discord  is  a torment,\u201d and, \u201cWhoever is granted a blessing and makes mention of it has shown gratitude for it. If he conceals it, then he is ungrateful for it,\u201d and, \u201cWhoever is given a gift and finds something he can give, then let him give it as a reward. If he cannot find anything to give, then let him praise the giver, for whoever praises him has shown gratitude for the gift and whoever conceals it is ungrateful for it.\u201d\nAllahu akbar! How much does the muwahhid mujahid have to show of gratitude towards his Lord for having blessed  him  with  Islam  and  the  Jama\u2019ah!  If  not  for  Allah,  he would be worshiping the tawaghit of the palaces and graveyards. If not for Allah, he would be following the scholars of the tawaghit and the du\u2019at of the Jahmiyyah. If not for Allah, he would be an effeminate \u201cmale\u201d having no protective jealousy for his Muslim sisters, a \u201cmale\u201d sitting back along with those who have remained behind from jihad. If not for Allah, he would be residing in Dar al-Kufr among the apostate policemen, judges, informants, spies, soldiers, and other murtaddin, or among the Jews, the Christians, the Magians, the atheists, and other kuffar. And if not for Allah, he would be from among the bughat (armed rebels), or the Khawarij, or other groups of discord, bid\u2019ah, and deviance.So praise be to Allah, who guided him to this, and he would never have been guided if Allah had not guided him.How difficult was the subjugation, the fitnah, and the affliction on the muwahhid mujahid before the blessing of the Jama\u2019ah! There were no schools in which his children \ncould study, no scholars from whom he could seek knowledge, no courts where he could litigate \u2013 for he is a muwahhid, rejecting the taghut courts \u2013 no dwellings in which he could live in peace and security, no lands in which he could seek refuge from the tawaghit, and no camps where he could train for war except in caves, jungles, or deserts, far from the obligation of the Jama\u2019ah as understood by the Salaf, which is the Khilafah.\nIf he were to manifest the Millah of Ibrahim back then among the kafirin and the murtaddin and call to it or strive to make preparations and wage jihad in order to terrorize the enemy, he would go to sleep not knowing if he would awaken in his home with his family or in a dark, underground  dungeon.\nThis  is  how  his  life  was,  and  then  Allah  blessed  him with the Jama\u2019ah, and all praise is due to Allah with whose blessing all good things are achieved. \u201cAnd remember when you were few and oppressed in the land, fearing that people might  abduct  you,  but  He  sheltered  you,  supported  you with His victory, and provided you with good things \u2013 that you might be grateful\u201d (Al-Anfal 26).\nThis blessing that he currently enjoys necessitates that he be grateful, both outwardly and inwardly, privately and publicly,  among  associates  and  strangers.  He  should  not leave his family without reminding them of it, nor his companions without mentioning it, nor the common people without spreading its virtues among them. He should praise Allah, who decreed this blessing for him and bestowed it upon him, and exalt Him for it, for there is no power or might except by Allah, al-Hayy al-Qayyum. The muwahhid mujahid then should make du\u2019a for the forerunners among the leaders and soldiers \u2013 particularly the shuhada among them \u2013 such as Shaykh Abu Mus\u2019ab az-Zarqawi, Shaykh Abu  Hamzah  al-Muhajir,  Shaykh  Abu  \u2018Umar  al-Baghdadi, Shaykh Abu Bakr al-\u2018Iraqi, Shaykh Abu \u2018Abdir-Rahman al-Bilawi,  Shaykh  Abul-Mu\u2019tazz  al-Qurashi,  Shaykh  Abu \u2018Ali  al-Anbari,  Shaykh  \u2018Umar  ash-Shishani,  and  Shaykh Abu Muhammad al-\u2018Adnani \u2013 may Allah accept them all. We consider them so \u2013 and Allah is their judge \u2013 and we do not place anyone above Allah\u2019s judgment. And whoever has not thanked the people has not thanked Allah.\nRather, if a man were to stay up all night as the two imams, al-Fudayl and Sufyan had done \u2013 counting what Allah has blessed him with through the Khilafah and its impact \u2013 it would still be little. \u201cAnd if you were to count the favors of Allah, you would not enumerate them. Indeed, mankind is most unjust and ungrateful\u201d (Ibrahim 34).\nAnd from the blessings of Allah upon the muwahhid mujahid is that He made him live until this era, until Allah revived the Khilafah through his jihad and made him from  among  those  who  defend  it,  guarding  its  frontiers.

Thus, the female slaves of Allah in the Islamic State became more knowledgeable of the affairs of the religion and of that which the Lord of creation had obligated upon them, particularly with respect  to  \u2018aqidah  and  tawhid,  both  of  which  were polluted in the lands of shirk.\nThe Most Firm Handhold of Iman\nKnow,  O  bondwoman  of  Allah,  that  Islam  is  to surrender to Allah through Tawhid, to submit to Him through obedience, and to disavow shirk and its people. Wala and bara are two of the principles of Islam according to ijma\u2019 (consensus), and they are from the testimony of \u201cLa ilaha illallah.\u201d A Muslim is not called a Muslim until he disavows kufr and its people, even if they are his closest relatives.\nA woman may say, \u201cBut my wala is to Allah, His Messenger,  and  the  believers,  and  the  greatest  evidence  of  that  is  that  I  live  in  Dar  al-Islam  and  enjoy the blessing of the shari\u2019ah of mankind\u2019s Lord!\u201d So know that having wala for the kuffar is not only through  aiding  them  and  supporting  them  against the Muslims. Rather, simply harboring love and affection for them and approving of them are examples of wala. Concerning love and affection, their place is in the heart, and the heart is the master and shepherd of the limbs. Imam Ahmad reported in his musnad that al-Bara Ibn \u2018Azib \uf068 said, \u201cWe were sitting with the Prophet g when he asked, \u2018Which bond of Islam \nis the strongest?\u2019 They said, \u2018The prayer.\u2019 He said, \u2018It is good, but it is not it.\u2019 They said, \u2018The zakah.\u2019 He said, \u2018It is good, but it is not it.\u2019 They said, \u2018Fasting Ramadan.\u2019 He said, \u2018It is good, but it is not it.\u2019 They said, \u2018The hajj.\u2019 He said, \u2018It is good, but it is not it.\u2019 They said, \u2018Jihad.\u2019 He said, \u2018It is good, but it is not it. Indeed, the strongest bond of Islam is to love for the sake of Allah and hate for the sake of Allah.\u2019\u201d\nSulayman  Al  ash-Shaykh  \uf072  said,  \u201cSo,  can  the religion be complete or the banner of jihad and the banner of commanding good and forbidding evil be raised  except  through  loving  for  the  sake  of  Allah, hating  for  the  sake  of  Allah,  having  enmity  for  the sake of Allah, and allying for the sake of Allah? And if the people were to agree on a single path and on mutual love with no enmity or hatred, there would be no means of dividing between truth and falsehood, nor between the believers and the kuffar, nor between the  allies  of  ar-Rahman  and  the  allies  of  Shaytan\u201d (Ad-Durar  as-Saniyyah).\nThere Has Emerged Between Us and You Enmity \nand Hatred\nThere is no wala without bara. Yes, you live amongst the muwahhidin and your wala is to Allah, His Messenger, and the believers, but do you disavow yourself of the enemies of Allah and the religion?\nPerhaps on the list of contacts in your phone there is someone from among your family, relatives, or friends who curses the Islamic State and openly declares their enmity towards its leaders, and perhaps some of your conversations with your relatives contain enmity and hatred for the Khilafah and its soldiers of which Allah is aware, but you\u2019re neither worried nor concerned \nSisters\n\fThe mujahid, Abu Hassan al-\u2018Iraqi \uf08a\nBaghdad Wilayah\nOn the 3rd of Rabi\u2019 al-Akhir, the istishhadi Abu Hassan  al-\u2018Iraqi  \uf08a  carried  out  an  attack  targeting Rafidi  murtaddin  in  Sadr  City  towards  the  east  of Baghdad in revenge for the Rafidi-Crusader coalition\u2019s repeated  targeting  of  health  institutions  in  Ninawa Wilayah. He set out and detonated his explosive vehicle on their dens, killing and injuring approximately 150 murtaddin. This was followed by two car bombs being  detonated  on  the  wounded  Rafidah,  one  at Jawadir Hospital and the other at Al-Kindy Hospital towards the east of the city, leading to 60 murtaddin being killed and wounded.\nOn the 9th of Rabi\u2019 al-Akhir, the istishhadi Yahya al-\u2018Iraqi \uf08a set out and detonated his explosive vehicle on the gatherings and dens of the Rafidi mushrikin in \u2018Ulwah Jamilah towards the east of Baghdad, killing and injuring approximately 80 of them. A second istishhadi attack was carried out by Abu Dujanah al\u2018Iraqi \uf08a, who entered into the midst of another group of  Rafidah  and  detonated  his  explosive  vest,  killing and injuring approximately 45 of them.\nOn the 11th of Rabi\u2019 al-Akhir, following close surveillance of the dens and gatherings of the Rafidi army and  Rafidi  Mobilization\u2019s  officers  and  leaders  inside Al-Kindy College of Medicine in the area of Nahdah towards  the  east  of  Baghdad  and  Dijlah  University College in the area of Dawrah towards the south of Baghdad,  Islamic  State  explosive  units  parked  and detonated two car bombs on their gatherings, leading to 70 of them being killed and wounded.\nSalahuddin Wilayah\nOn the 3rd of Rabi\u2019 al-Akhir, a number of Islamic State inghimasiyyin launched an attack on Rafidi army positions in the city of Samarra. Following fierce clashes, they entered a Federal Police base as well as a  base  belonging  to  the  Salam  Detachments  militia in  the  middle  of  Samarra,  and  succeeded  in  killing approximately  100  murtaddin  and  in  injuring  dozens  more,  with  an  officer  ranked  lieutenant  colonel among those dead. Several of the murtaddin\u2019s vehicles were likewise burned, and parts of the Federal Police building and the Salam Detachments militia\u2019s building were also destroyed.\nJordan\nOn the 7th of Rabi\u2019 al-Akhir, an Islamic State covert unit succeeded in assassinating the murtadd Bassam al-Hawrani, an officer ranked first captain in the murtadd  Jordanian  police.  They  targeted  and  killed him on the Ayil road in Ma\u2019an towards the south of Jordan.\nRaqqah Wilayah\nOn the 8th of Rabi\u2019 al-Akhir, a number of Islamic  State  soldiers  launched  a  surprise  attack  on  PKK positions in the town of Tall as-Saman and in the village of Khaniz towards the north of Raqqah.

I bear witness that there is no god except Allah, who is One without any partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad g is His slave and messenger. To proceed:\nAllah  c  said,  \u201cO  you  who  have  believed,  when you  encounter  a  company  [from  the  enemy  forces], stand firm and remember Allah much that you may be  successful.  And  obey  Allah  and  His  Messenger, and do not dispute and [thus] lose courage and [then] your strength would depart; and be patient. Indeed, Allah  is  with  the  patient\u201d  (Al-Anfal  45-46).  And Allah c says, \u201cSo be patient. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth. And let them not disquiet you who are not certain [in faith]\u201d (Ar-Rum 60).\nIt  is  patience,  steadfastness,  and  certainty  in the  promise  of  Allah,  despite  the  tribulations  and difficulty,  despite the  various  parties  viciously mobilizing,  despite  the  roaring  of  multiple  rocket \nlaunchers  and  aerial  bombardments.  Those  who have  trust  and  certainty  in  their  Lord\u2019s  support remain  unfaltering  and  perseverant,  anticipating their  reward,  marching  forth  and  not  turning  their backs. They were not weakened by the tremors \u2013 as if  powerless  and  perplexed  or  erratic  and  faint  of heart. Rather, in the darkness of night they straddled the  light  of  truth  and  kindled  with  their  blood  the torch  of  guidance,  while  shunning  the  paths  of deviance. From the book of their Lord they nourished themselves and upon the Sunnah of their Prophet g did they proceed and work. They knew that victory is indeed from Allah and that it was never for a moment due  to  the  magnitude  of  manpower  or  equipment. For indeed Allah is Mighty and none can overpower Him. Indeed He is the Compeller who forsakes him who has climaxed in strength and manpower. He is wise  as  He  decrees  affairs,  with  all  their  means,  as He  puts  things  in  their  rightful  places.  He  is  wise in His administering and granting victory to whom He grants victory, and in abandoning whomever He abandons of His slaves. Neither weakness nor defect can penetrate His administration. He said, and His word is unmistakable, \u201cIf Allah should aid you, no \nExclusive\n\ftheir efforts on corrupt principles, upon which they built  their  deeds,  trends,  and  erroneous  opinions. Their results continue to contradict their principles, so they are left with no choice but to support their crumbling principles with even more falsehood, which only increases them in misguidance and increases their structure in ruin, until eventually nothing of Islam remains  therein.\nAs we discuss the methods of establishing the Islamic state, between those who follow the prophetic method and those who follow the paths of deviance, we find ourselves compelled to take a long look at the Twelver Rafidi experiment. This experiment brought them \u2013 through their own words and deeds \u2013 to fabricate a new religion that has no connection to Islam, except as much as the religions of the Jews and Christians have a connection to the religion of Ibrahim \uf06e. In studying this experiment, which spread over eleven centuries, we see that it is one of the longest of experiments and the clearest in showing the extent of deviance caused by its being built on a corrupt principle in working to establish the Islamic state. Their deceitful claim of striving to safeguard Islam of heresies and deviations is thus laid bare.\nThe Onset of Their Call\u2026 A Fabricated Appoint-\nment of Leadership\nThe  Rafidi  mushrikin  claim  that  the  beginning of  their  call  came  in  the  lifetime  of  the  Prophet  g through his nass (verbatim appointment) of \u2018Ali Ibn Abi Talib \uf068 and his descendants after him as khulafa and imams. But they have no evidence of this nass, other  than  what  they  have  fabricated  of  false  interpretations of texts from the Book and the Sunnah. In fact, the established evidences negate what they claim, like the saying of \u2018Umar \uf068, \u201cIf I were to not appoint a successor, then indeed Allah\u2019s Messenger g did not appoint a successor. And if I were to appoint a successor, then indeed Abu Bakr appointed a successor\u201d (Reported by Muslim). This shows that the Prophet g did not appoint \u2018Ali or any of the Sahabah \uf06a as his  successor.\nAlso, al-Aswad said, \u201cIt was mentioned in front of \u2018Aishah that \u2018Ali \uf06b was an heir (to authority), so she said, \u2018When did [the Prophet] appoint him? For indeed I was holding him to my chest when he called for a washbowl and then his body drooped and I did not realize that he had died. So when did he appoint him?\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim). Like-\nwise,  the  Sahabah  had  consensus  upon  giving  the bay\u2019ah (pledge of allegiance) to Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar, and \u2018Uthman \uf06a \u2013 and included in that consensus was \u2018Ali Ibn Abi Talib and his sons, al-Hasan and al-Husayn \uf06a. There are many other evidences, like these, that destroy this lie of the Rafidah.\nSomething else that invalidates this supposed nass is  the  dispute  among  the  Rafidah  and  others  who claim to support Ahl al-Bayt, as each of them says the authority  should  go  to  someone  different,  and  specifically after \u2018Ali \uf068 was killed. There are those who said it belonged to the descendants of al-\u2018Abbas Ibn \u2018Abdil-Muttalib. Others said it belonged to al-Hasan Ibn \u2018Ali or al-Husayn Ibn \u2018Ali or Muhammad Ibn \u2018Ali (Ibnul-Hanafiyyah)  \uf06a.  And  others  even  claimed  it for the sons of Ja\u2019far Ibn Abi Talib \uf068. Whenever any of the above would die, those who held these beliefs would fall further into misguidance by following such doubtful matters. If only they actually had a supported nass, the truth of their imam would be established. But too often they found nothing with which to uphold their claim over that of their opponents, other than  made  up  miracles  and  fallacious  phenomena, just as the Rafidah declared the imamah of \u2018Ali Ibn al-Husayn (known as as-Sajjad) \u2013 while rejecting the imamah of his uncle Muhammad Ibn al-Hanafiyyah \u2013 due to the former\u2019s bay\u2019ah supposedly being verbally declared by stones and trees!\nThe Source of Deviance of the Rafidah\u2026 Claim-\ning Infallibility for the Imams\nWe are able to summarize the main principle upon which  the  religion  of  the  Rafidah  has  stood,  and  it is that upon which all of their misguidances and deviances are built until this very day. It is their belief that  the  Islamic  state  cannot  be  established  without an imam who fulfills their conditions, for which Allah gave no authority. The most important of these conditions is that he be infallible: untouched by any defect whether apparent or hidden, knowledgeable of everything, including the unseen, and verified by the command of Allah c Himself. Thereby, they assert that the  people\u2019s  religion  cannot  be  established  without this imam, and that when people believe completely in their imams, obeying them in all that they command, then their affairs will be set straight and their state will be upon the prophetic methodology. And it is not enough for them that this imam possess these traits, but he must be unique among men, having no \n\f", "schema:headline": "Be Patient, for Indeed the Promise of Allah Is True", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "25"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah7-Military-and-Covert-Operations", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "As the soldiers of the Khilafah continue waging war on the forces of kufr, we take a glimpse at a number of recent operations conducted by the mujahidin of the Islamic State that have succeeded in expanding the territory of the Khilafah, or terrorizing, massacring, and humiliating the enemies of Allah.

Whoever accepted was encompassed with this mercy, and whoever opposed it and resisted was fought and dealt with using severe brutality until this enemy submitted to the command of Allah.  The  Prophet\u2019s  Sirah  contains  the  best  evidence of this.\nFollowing  the  Prophet\u2019s  return  from  Badr,  he  ordered that the prisoner \u2018Uqbah Ibn Abi Mu\u2019it be killed in  captivity,  and  this  was  because  \u2018Uqbah  had  been among  the  harshest  of  the  people  in  harming  Islam and the Muslims. Adh-Dhahabi said in the sirah he authored, \u201cThe Prophet \uf067 killed \u2018Uqbah Ibn Abi Mu\u2019it in [the valley of] \u2018Irq adh-Dhubyah. When the Prophet \uf067 ordered that he be killed, \u2018Uqbah said, \u2018Who will look after my sons, O Muhammad?\u2019 He said, \u2018Hellfire.\u2019 \u2018Asim Ibn Thabit Ibn Abil-Aqlah then killed him, and it was said that \u2018Ali \uf068 killed him.\u201d\nIn the Battle of Uhud, Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 ordered that the prisoner Abu \u2018Azzah al-Jumahi be killed, and he was a man who had daughters. Ibn Kathir said, \u201cNo mushrik  was  taken  prisoner  except  Abu  \u2018Azzah  al-Jumahi, who was also among the prisoners on the day of Badr. The Prophet \uf067 freed him without ransom [after Badr], and placed a condition on him that he not return to fighting him \uf067. When he was taken prisoner on the day of Uhud, Abu \u2018Azzah said, \u2018O Muhammad, free me for the sake of my daughters and I promise not to fight you.\u2019 So Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said to him, \u2018I will not let you walk around in Makkah saying, \u2018I deceived Mu-\n22Article\nhammad twice.\u2019\u2019 He then gave the order and his neck was struck. Some scholars have mentioned that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said that day, \u2018The believer is not stung from the same hole twice!\u2019\u201d (Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah).These two prisoners were not in a position warranting that they be freed, ransomed, or shown mercy, for if this were to have occurred it would have had a negative effect on the Prophet\u2019s reputation, as he \uf067 made clear when he killed Abu \u2018Azzah.\nAlso,  the  Prophet  \uf067  would  not  leave  one  who harmed Islam and the Muslims safe within the confines of his home, even if his harm was through mere speech and incitement, as was the case with the Jew, Ka\u2019b Ibn al-Ashraf.  Ibn  Ishaq  said,  \u201cHe  incited  against  Allah\u2019s Messenger  \uf067,  recited  abusive  poetry,  and  lamented those  of  Quraysh  thrown  into  the  well  at  Badr.  Ka\u2019b Ibn al-Ashraf then returned to Madinah and composed harassing poetry directed against Umm al-Fadl Bint alHarith and later against other women of the Muslims\u201d (Sirat Ibn Ishaq).\nAt this point, the order was issued from Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 to eliminate this taghut; he then asked who was prepared to carry out the operation. Jabir Ibn \u2018Abdillah \uf068 narrates, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u2018Who will deal with Ka\u2019b Ibn al-Ashraf, for indeed he has harmed Allah and His Messenger?\u2019 Muhammad Ibn Maslamah stood up and said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, would you like me to kill him?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes\u2019\u201d (Reported by alBukhari and Muslim).\nLater, following the Battle of al-Ahzab, Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 headed for Bani Quraydhah in order to besiege them, as recompense for their breaking of their treaty with the Prophet \uf067. Allah\u2019s judgment concern-\nArticle\ftained through abundance and pleasure in the dunya, while not being afflicted by hardship? Rather, it is attained by being killed beneath the shades of swords. \u201cOr did you think that you would enter Jannah and what came to those before you has yet to come to you \u2013 they were afflicted by hardship and distress, and they were shaken until the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, \u2018When will the support of Allah come?\u2019\u201d (Al-Baqarah 214). At-Tabari \uf072 said, \u201cThe meaning of these words is: Or do you think that you, O believers in Allah and His Messengers, shall enter into Jannah before you are afflicted as those before you were tested and tried with hardship \u2013 i.e. difficulty and poverty \u2013 and distress \u2013 i.e. illness and disease, and before you are shaken as they were shaken, meaning due to what their enemies brought to them of fear and terror, until the people consider Allah\u2019s support to be slow in coming to them, so they say, \u2018When will Allah support us?\u2019\u201d\nThis  was  not  unknown  to  Hiraql,  the  Roman  king, when he said to Abu Sufyan, \u201cI had asked you how your war with him carries on, and you claimed that sometimes you win the battles, and other times, he does. Such is the condition of the messengers, as they are tested and the ultimate victory is theirs\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim). How could this be unknown to the muwahhidin who think well of Allah?!\nAnd verily this religion is dear, and calling to tawhid and raising the word of Allah in the land requires enormous sacrifice, just like what was offered by the People of the Trench, whom the taghut of their time completely eradicated, leaving no person of them alive. And they \u2013 after believing in the Lord of the boy \u2013 watched as the kuffar dug the trenches and lit fires therein, in order to cast into them those who were steadfast and would not apostatize. But that did not even scratch at the surface of their iman, nor did it budge them from their religion, until even a woman came holding her baby boy while she was hesitating to throw herself into the fire, so her child said to her in encouragement, \u201cDear mother, have patience, for you are upon the truth\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Suhayb).\nAl-Bukhari  wrote,  \u201cChapter:  Those  Who  Choose  to Be  Struck,  Killed,  and  Humiliated  Rather  than  [Be  Coerced into Saying or Doing] Kufr.\u201d He mentioned therein the following narration of Khabbab Ibn al-Aratt \uf068, \u201cWe complained to Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 while he was reclining against his folded cloak in the shade of the Ka\u2019bah. We said to him, \u2018Will you not seek support for us? Will you not supplicate Allah for us?\u2019 He said, \u2018There were men before you who were put in holes, dug in the ground. Then saws were brought  to  them  and  placed  atop  their  heads,  until  they were split into two, but that did not turn them back from their religion. Their skins were combed with iron combs, separating their flesh from their bones or nerves, but that did not turn them back from their religion. By Allah! This matter will come to completion, until the rider from Sana\u2019a will travel to Hadramawt, fearing none but Allah or a wolf for his flock. But you seek to hasten matters.\u2019\u201d\nFor the struggle between truth and falsehood, there is a price that the believers must pay, as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cSo they kill and are killed\u201d (At-Tawbah 111). And what is greater than the Battle of Uhud as an excellent study and lesson \nlearned? In that battle, it was not a single wazir, amir, or leader, nor only two, three, or ten who were killed. Rather, it was the Sayyid of Shuhada, Hamzah, the uncle of the Prophet \uf067, among seventy of the best of the Sahabah \uf06a. In one day, this number of men were killed and mutilated. But which men? They were the Companions of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067. And on the Day of Uhud, the voice of kufr arose and the kuffar became inflated with pride. The kuffar thought their feat would last forever. Abu Sufyan stood and said, \u201cIs Muhammad there?\u201d He \uf067 said, \u201cDo not answer him.\u201d So he said, \u201cIs Ibn Abi Quhafah [Abu Bakr as-Siddiq] there?\u201d He \uf067 said, \u201cDo not answer him.\u201d So he said, \u201cIs [\u2018Umar] Ibnul-Khattab there?\u201d When no one answered, Abu Sufyan said, \u201cIndeed they have been killed, for if they were alive, they would have responded!\u201d But \u2018Umar was not able to contain himself, so he said, \u201cYou have lied, O enemy of Allah! Allah has kept for you what shall disgrace you!\u201d Abu Sufyan said, \u201cHubal [an idol] is highest!\u201d So the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cAnswer him.\u201d They said, \u201cWhat should we say?\u201d He said, \u201cSay, Allah is higher and more majestic!\u201d Abu Sufyan said, \u201cWe have \u2018Uzza, and there is no \u2018Uzza for you!\u201d So the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cAnswer him.\u201d They said, \u201cWhat should we say?\u201d He said, \u201cSay, Allah is our patron, and there is no patron for you!\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from al-Bara Ibn \u2018Azib).\nAn Arab poet once said, \u201cIf a chief of ours departs, another chief stands, speaking and acting as nobles do. And our days are known to our enemy, as they are crowned and adorned in glory.\u201d\nAre  the  believers  today  better  to  Allah  than  that  first generation of men, those who were tested and shaken greatly  until  their  hearts  reached  their  throats?!  And  whoever thinks that the conquests of Rome and Constantinople will be made through empty words \u2013 not wounds \u2013 is confused and mistaken!1\nIt should be clear then that after the trials and tribulations, the believing muwahhid stands solid, by his Lord\u2019s permission, and that the munafiq and anyone with weak iman will fall. Thereafter, only the pure will remain. These are those whose cores have been cleansed and clarified of any impurities and filth of the dunya. Then, at that time only, the voice of truth will rise in their souls, and the answer will come to them, descending upon them in all its coolness and tranquility. \u201cO! Verily the victory of Allah is near\u201d (Al-Baqarah 214). Indeed such victory and conquest is near, as we find the wind of our blessed Khilafah blowing from east to west, despite the claims of the enemy. Thus, patience is most fitting, and Allah\u2019s aid alone is sought.\n1   The conquest of Constantinople comes after very many martyrs and wounds, as in the events leading up to it, one third of the Muslim army  is  killed  in  the  Malhamah  against  the  Crusaders  who  encamp in Dabiq. The triumphant survivors thereafter advance through their jihad until they reach Constantinople and lay siege to it. Only then, after much blood and sweat, does the takbir and tahlil of the patient and persevering muwahhid mujahidin cause the defenses of the city to collapse. This blessing and bounty from Allah through takbir and tahlil is the reward for sincere intentions and serious actions, not the lack thereof found in the empty words of the hypocrites and the sickhearted. \n\f", "schema:headline": "Brutality and Severity towards the Kuffar", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "21"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah6-Military-and-Covert-Operations", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "6", "schema:articleBody": "As the soldiers of the Khilafah continue waging war on the forces of kufr, we take a glimpse at a number of recent operations conducted by the mujahidin of the Islamic State that have succeeded in expanding the territory of the Khilafah, or terrorizing, massacring, and humiliating the enemies of Allah. These operations are merely a selection of the numerous operations that the Islamic State has conducted on various fronts across many regions over the course of the last few weeks.\nThe War on Turkey\nOn the 7th of Rabi\u2019 al-Akhir, the soldiers of the Khilafah destroyed a Turkish BMP after targeting it with a guided missile near the town of Qabbasin.\nOn the 8th of Rabi\u2019 al-Akhir, the soldiers of the Khilafah carried out an assault on Turkish army and Sahwah positions west of the city of Bab.

So He ordered remembrance until the heart is firm with certainty and the tongue is firm with dhikr, saying what the companions of Talut said, \u2018Our Lord! Pour upon us patience and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people\u2019 (Al-Baqarah  250).  This  condition  cannot  be  accomplished except  through  the  strength  of  knowledge  and  the ignition of insight, which is the commendable courage of men. The third is that you must remember the promise Allah made to you when you sold your souls, as well as the reward He has for you.\u201d\nI say that all of these opinions should be considered,  as  one  should  mention  Allah  with  his  tongue while  his  heart  feels  bold,  remembering  what  Allah promised him of support in the Dunya and gardens in the Akhirah. And Allah c said to Musa and Harun, \u201cDo not slacken in My remembrance\u201d (Ta Ha 42).  Ibn  Kathir  \uf072  said,  \u201cThis  means  they  were  to not languish in the remembrance of Allah when they faced Fir\u2019awn, that Allah\u2019s dhikr would support and empower them, as well as being a decisive authority against  [Fir\u2019awn].\u201d\nKnow  that  the  dhikr  of  Allah  during  combat  is something secret. Al-Hakim authenticated the report from Abu Musa \uf068 that Allah\u2019s Messenger g would dislike raised voices during combat.1\nThe eighth path to victory is du\u2019a (supplication). Allah c said, \u201cSay, \u2018My Lord would not care for you if  not  for  your  supplication\u2019\u201d  (Al-Furqan  77),  and, \u201cSo call upon Him, being sincere to Him in religion\u201d (Ghafir 65), and, \u201cInvoke Him in fear and aspiration. Indeed,  the  mercy  of  Allah  is  near  to  the  doers  of good\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 56), and \u201cYour Lord says, \u2018Call upon Me; I will respond to you.\u2019 Indeed, those who disdain My worship will loathingly enter Jahannam\u201d (Ghafir 60), and, \u201cWhen My servants ask you concerning Me, then indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond  to  Me  [with  obedience]  and  believe  in  Me that they may be rightly guided\u201d (Al-Baqarah 186).Allah\u2019s Messenger g said, \u201cDu\u2019a is \u2018ibadah (worship)\u201d  (Reported  by  Ibn  Majah,  Abu  Dawud,  and \n1  The author\u2019s use of this hadith does not negate the raising of one\u2019s voice with dhikr during battles. Rather, the Prophet\u2019s g dislike of raised voices during combat means at the moment of contact with the enemy: in his time, when swords clashed, and in our time, when triggers are pulled. And Allah knows best.\nat-Tirmidhi from an-Nu\u2019man Ibn Bashir). Al-Hakim and others reported from Abu Hurayrah \uf068, that he g said, \u201cNothing is more precious to Allah than du\u2019a\u201d (Al-Mustadrak). He also said, \u201cWhoever does not ask of Allah, He is angry with him\u201d (Reported by at-Tirmidhi from Abu Hurayrah). Ibn Taymiyyah \uf072 said, \u201cVictory and provision are obtained through various means. The most sure of them is the du\u2019a of the believers.\u201d He also said, \u201cWhen victory was determined on the Day of Badr, and the Prophet g told his companions that it would come and that the enemy would fall, what led to that was the Prophet g seeking help and making du\u2019a\u201d (Majmu\u2019 al-Fatawa).\nThis is Allah\u2019s Messenger g who, when he saw the multitudes  of  his  enemy  and  their  strength,  as  well as the scarcity of his companions and their weakness, resorted  to  the  only  one  in  whose  Hand  victory  is held. \u201cVictory is not except from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 126). \u2018Umar Ibn al-Khattab \uf068 said, \u201cOn the Day of Badr, Allah\u2019s Messenger g looked at the mushrikin, who were one-thousand, and  at  his  companions,  while  his  companions  were three-hundred nineteen men. So the Prophet of Allah g faced the qiblah, then spread out his hands and began calling out to his Lord, \u2018O Allah, fulfill what You promised me. O Allah, give me what You promised me. O Allah, if You destroy this small group of Muslims, You will not be worshiped on the earth.\u2019 He would not stop calling out to his Lord with his hands extended, facing the qiblah, until his cloak fell from his shoulders\u201d (Reported by Muslim).\nHe  g  would  make  du\u2019a  against  the  mushrikin in  general,  saying,  \u201cO  Allah,  Revealer  of  the  Book, Swift  in  Judgment;  O  Allah,  defeat  the  factions;  O Allah, defeat them and shake their foundations\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from \u2018Abdillah Ibn Abi Awfa). He would also specifically mention their individuals  and  chiefs,  as  Ibn  Mas\u2019ud  \uf068  narrated, saying, \u201cThe Prophet g faced the Ka\u2019bah and made du\u2019a against some members of Quraysh: against Shaybah  Ibn  Rabi\u2019ah,  \u2018Utbah  Ibn  Rabi\u2019ah,  al-Walid  Ibn \u2018Utbah,  and  Abu  Jahl  Ibn  Hisham.

May blessings and peace be upon the seal of the prophets and messengers, Muhammad, and upon his family and all his companions. As for what follows:\nIn  this  article  we  will  discuss  the  ruling  of  giving da\u2019wah to the asli kuffar (i.e. those who are disbelievers in origin, as opposed to those who became disbelievers after previously being Muslims) prior to fighting them. We will also discuss the ruling of giving da\u2019wah both to those whom the da\u2019wah has already reached and those whom it has not yet reached, prior to fighting them. We likewise discuss the evidences for these issues, as well as the evidence for initiating battle without giving da\u2019wah to those who have already heard of the religion of Islam. We will also clarify the ruling on killing the kuffar whom the da\u2019wah has not yet reached, and also clarify whether or not these rulings apply to the murtaddin.\nRulings Related to Giving Da\u2019wah to the Harbi \n(Belligerent) Kuffar\nWhat is meant by the harbi kuffar is the kuffar to whom the Muslims have not granted security through either a covenant of security, a ceasefire agreement, or a dhimmah contract. And what is meant by giving them da\u2019wah is to call them firstly to Islam, and if they refuse, to call them to pay the jizyah, prior to fighting them. The fuqaha have stated that da\u2019wah with them is of two types: \u201chaqiqi\u201d da\u2019wah, and \u201chukmi\u201d da\u2019wah. As for \u201chaqiqi\u201d da\u2019wah,  it  is  da\u2019wah  which  is  given  by  way  of  speech before fighting begins, and as for \u201chukmi\u201d da\u2019wah, it is that the da\u2019wah spreads, becomes manifest, reaches the harbi kuffar, and as a result, takes the place of haqiqi da\u2019wah.\nHaqiqi Da\u2019wah\nThe description of haqiqi da\u2019wah is that the Muslim leader calls the kuffar to Islam when he descends in their territory. Al-Qayrawani al-Maliki said, \u201cAnd it is more beloved to us that the enemy not be fought until he is called to Allah\u2019s religion, unless they hasten to fight us. So  either  they  embrace  Islam  or  pay  jizyah,  otherwise they are fought. And jizyah is only accepted from them if they are in a place where our authority can reach them. If, however, they are far away from us, jizyah is not accepted from them unless they move to our lands, otherwise they are fought\u201d (Ar-Risalah by al-Qayrawani).\nThey are first called to Islam, and their embracing of Islam is by merely pronouncing the shahadatayn (the \ntwo testimonies of faith) without having to carry out the laws, because carrying out the laws of Islam is impossible at the point of battle. So it is obligatory on them to enter Islam in that situation, and this is achieved with the pillar of the shahadatayn.\nImam Malik said, \u201cWhen da\u2019wah becomes obligatory, they are only called to Islam in a general sense without mentioning the laws, unless they ask about them, in which case they should be clarified to them. Likewise, they are called to jizyah in a general sense without explaining the details  and  without  specifying  the  amount,  unless  the Muslims are asked about that, in which case it should be clarified for them (the kuffar)\u201d (At-Taj wal-Iklil).\nAs for the length of the period of da\u2019wah, some scholars said it is three continuous days, just as a murtadd is called on for three days to repent before being killed.\nHukmi Da\u2019wah\nHukmi da\u2019wah is achieved when the kuffar hear of the religion of Islam and what it calls to. Allah c said, \u201cAnd this Quran was revealed to me that I may warn you  thereby  and  whomever  it  reaches\u201d  (Al-An\u2019am  19). In  his  tafsir,  Imam  at-Tabari  narrates  from  Mujahid that he said, \u201c\u2018And this Quran was revealed to me that I may warn you thereby\u2019: \u2018The Arabs,\u2019 \u2018and whomever it reaches\u2019: \u2018The non-Arabs\u2019\u201d (Jami\u2019 al-Bayan fi Tawil alQuran).\nIbn  \u2018Abbas  said,  \u201c\u2018And  this  Quran  was  revealed  to me that I may warn you thereby\u2019, meaning: the people of Makkah, \u2018and whomever it reaches,\u2019 meaning: if this Quran reaches anyone it is a warner for them\u2019\u201d (Jami\u2019 alBayan by Imam at-Tabari).\nAbu Hurayrah narrated, that Allah\u2019s Messenger g said,  \u201cBy  Him  in  Whose  hand  is  Muhammad\u2019s  soul, no one from this ummah hears of me \u2013 neither Jew nor Christian \u2013 and then dies without having believed in that which I have been sent with except that he will be from among the people of Hellfire\u201d (Reported by Muslim).\nImam  Ibn  Taymiyyah  r  said,  \u201cIf  the  da\u2019wah  of Allah\u2019s Messenger  g  \u2013 the da\u2019wah to Allah\u2019s religion with which He sent him \u2013 reaches anyone and they do not respond to it, it is obligatory to fight them \u2018until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah\u2019\u201d (Majmu\u2019  al-Fatawa).\nThe scholars differed with regards to giving da\u2019wah to the kuffar before fighting them. Among them were those who stipulated that da\u2019wah be given in all cases before fighting, regardless of whether the da\u2019wah has reached them or has not, and this is the position of the majority \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "A Mujahid's Memories from the Battle of Mosul", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "9"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5-The-Siyahah-of-Jihad", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "5", "schema:articleBody": "Abu Dawud reported in his sunan from Abu Umamah al-Bahili \uf068 that a man said, \u201cO Messenger of Allah, permit me to practice siyahah.\u201d So the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cIndeed, the siyahah of my ummah is jihad for Allah\u2019s cause.\u201d Abu Dawud was silent concerning the authenticity of this hadith. Al-Hakim reported it in his mustadrak and declared its isnad sahih. \u2018Abdul-Haqq al-Ishbili and adh-Dhahabi declared the hadith sahih. And an-Nawawi and al-\u2018Iraqi declared its isnad jayyid (good).\nThis hadith is from among that which some people of hijrah and jihad have incorrectly understood, thinking that the siyahah of jihad means, as according to its modern usage, \u201ctravelling from country to country for the purpose of pleasure or sightseeing and discovery.\u201d1 Due to this misunderstanding, if one were to observe some aspect of beauty in the land to which he has made hijrah, such as mountains, rivers, beaches, and trees, or were to find some aspect of luxury in food, drink, dress, and shelter, he would point to that blossom of worldly life and say, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 spoke the truth. Indeed, jihad is the \u2018tourism\u2019 of the Ummah!\u201d\nThis is how many people have misunderstood the hadith and the athar, and what a big difference between what is intended in the noble hadith and what the minds of many people have understood!\nIf it were asked, \u201cWhat is the meaning of the \u2018siyahah\u2019 mentioned if it is not tourism?\u201d the answer would be that the uncommon Arabic words in hadith are to be interpreted according to the eloquent tongue of the Arabs and according to the understanding of the righteous Salaf \u2013 not according to the terminology coined by  the  later  generations,  nor  according  to  that  with  which  the people of the modern era are acquainted \u2013 and this is done by referring back to the imams specialized in the language and the uncommon Arabic words, who have preserved the meanings of the Quran and hadith for those generations after them just as the Quran reciters and the muhaddithin have preserved the words of the two revelations \u2013 may Allah reward them, on behalf of Islam and the Muslims, with tremendous good.\nIbn  Qutaybah  \uf072  (died  276AH)  stated  in  his  explanation of the term \u201csiyahah\u201d in the athar, \u201cSiyahah is to leave the cities \n1   This is the definition of siyahah in the contemporary Arabic dictionary \u201cAl-Mu\u2019jam al-Wasit.\u201d The word siyahah, in the context of the hadith, is often wrongly translated as \u201ctourism\u201d in English.\nand travel into the open land, like the action of\u2026the worshipers of Bani Israil\u2026 He \uf067 meant that Allah \uf062 forbade the Muslims from this and sent him with the religion of moderation and monotheism\u201d  (Gharib  al-Hadith). \nIbnul-Anbari \uf072 (died 328AH) said, \u201cSiyahah is to head to the outer reaches of the lands and to isolate oneself from the people, such that one attends neither Jumu\u2019ah nor congregational prayers\u201d (az-Zahir).\nAbu Mansur al-Azhari \uf072 (died 370AH) said, \u201cAl-Layth said, \u2018Siyahah is that a man travels throughout the land for worship and monasticism, and the siyahah of this ummah is fasting and regularly attending the masajid\u2019\u201d (Tahdhib al-Lughah).\nThus, the siyahah that the Prophet \uf067 did not permit is that of monasticism, which the Most Just of Judges had not legislated. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cThen We sent Our messengers following their [i.e. Nuh and Ibrahim\u2019s] footsteps and followed them with \u2018Isa, the son of Maryam, and gave him the Injil. And We placed in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy and monasticism, which they innovated; We did not prescribe it for them except [that they did so] seeking the approval of Allah. But they did not observe it duly. So We gave the ones who believed among them their reward, but many of them are defiantly disobedient\u201d (Al-Hadid 27).\n\u2018Urwah  Ibn  az-Zubayr \uf072  said,  \u201cThe  wife  of  \u2018Uthman  Ibn Madh\u2019un entered\u2026upon \u2018Aishah looking disheveled, so \u2018Aishah asked her, \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 She said, \u2018My husband prays all night and fasts all days.\u2019 Then, the Prophet \uf067 entered and \u2018Aishah mentioned that to him, so Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 met with \u2018Uthman and said, \u2018O \u2018Uthman, indeed monasticism has not been prescribed for us. Is there not an example in me for you? For by Allah, I am the most fearful of Allah among you and the one most observant of His limits\u2019\u201d (Reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, and Ibn Hibban).Likewise,  when  one  of  the  Sahabah  \uf06a  sought  permission from the Prophet \uf067 to practice siyahah, he \uf067 forbade him from imitating the deviant monks and guided him to what Allah \uf063 had legislated as a methodology for the best ummah brought forth for mankind, jihad for His cause, which contains what is found in the monastic siyahah of zuhd, reclusion, dhikr, and worship. And by adhering to these realities, the mujahid may come closer to Allah and thereby become from among the monks of the night and the \nArticle\fA  final  benefit  to  note  is  that  we  are  not  more courageous  than  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  \uf067,  who  would wear a coat of armor and a helmet, just as he had a sword. \u2018Aishah \uf069 said, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 passed away while his coat of armor was pawned to a Jew for thirty measures of barley\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari). It  is  also  established  that  the  Prophet  \uf067  wore  two coats of armor, one on top of the other, on the Day of Uhud (Reported by Ahmad and Abu Dawud from asSaib Ibn Yazid). Likewise, Anas Ibn Malik narrated that the Prophet \uf067 entered Makkah, the year it was conquered, and he was wearing a helmet on his head (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nMoreover, the Lord of might guided us to using metal ingots as the basis of producing the weapons of today. In the story of Dhul-Qarnayn, He \uf063 said, \u201c\u2018Bring  me  blocks  of  iron,\u2019  until,  when  he  leveled what  was  between  the  two  flanks,  he  said,  \u2018Blow,\u2019 until,  when  he  had  made  it  a  fire,  he  said,  \u2018Bring me  molten  copper  to  pour  over  it\u2019\u201d  (Al-Kahf  96). That, and it has been discovered recently that adding a  percentage  of  copper  to  iron  is  the  best  way  to harden the iron and increase its strength, resistance, and  solidity.\nAs for preparations related to media, then indeed the  battles  of  the  mujahidin  and  their  enemies revolve, today, around two important axes. The first is the military axis, which has already been mentioned. The  second  is  the  axis  of  confronting  the  Satanic media that has distorted the identity of the Ummah, perverted  its  \u2018aqidah  and  values,  and  propped  up the  pillars  of  humiliation  and  psychological  defeat. Indeed,  the  blazing  missiles  of  media  are  more lethal  and  more  dangerous  for  the  Ummah  and  its \nAlso,  Allah  taught  Nuh  how  to  construct  ships. He  said,  \u201cMake  the  ark  under  Our  eyes  and  with Our inspiration\u201d (Hud 37). At-Tabari reported from Ibn \u2018Abbas \uf06b that he said, \u201cHe did not know how to make the ark, so Allah inspired to him to make it  based  on  the  model  of  a  bird\u2019s  breast.\u201d  And  the Prophet \uf067 commended those soldiers of his ummah who rode ships, as is in the hadith of Umm Haram \uf069 (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim). So is there anyone  to  undertake  such  production?\nAllah \uf063 also said, \u201cAllah came at their building from  the  foundations,  so  the  roof  fell  upon  them from  above\u201d  (An-Nahl  26).  It  is  known  to  anyone who  understands  explosives  and  how  to  use  them that this verse contains the basis for demolition using explosives. \nFurthermore, no industry has been encouraged as much  as  the  manufacturing  of  war  tools,  as  it  was reported that the Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cThree people enter into Jannah due to a single arrow: The one who made it, hoping it will be used for good, the one who shoots it, and the one who passes it [to the shooter]\u201d (Reported by Ibn Majah, Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidhi, and  an-Nasai  from  \u2018Uqbah  Ibn  \u2018Amir).  How,  then, about one who manufactures a rocket or an aircraft or invents an explosive material?\nmen than the infernal missiles fired from warplanes. Accordingly, it is only appropriate that the mujahidin \u2013  those  whom  Allah  has  accommodated  with  the ability to break the force of their enemies militarily \u2013 also contend on another front: the media front.\nAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cWage jihad against the mushrikin with your tongues\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from Anas Ibn Malik). He \uf067 also said, \u201cIndeed, the believer wages jihad with his sword and his tongue. By the One in whose hand is my soul, it is as if you are shooting [with your words] a barrage of arrows\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from Ka\u2019b Ibn Malik). Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 would employ his era\u2019s most effective form of media, that which was harshest on the hearts of  his  enemies:  poetry.  At-Tirmidhi  and  an-Nasai reported from Anas Ibn Malik that the Prophet \uf067 entered  Makkah  for  \u2018Umrat  al-Qada  and  \u2018Abdullah Ibn Rawahah was walking in front of him, saying,\nO sons of infidels, leave alone His way,for we strike for His revelation today \u2013a strike that, heads from their napes, will split,making a beloved, his beloved, forget.\u2018Umar  then  said,  \u201cIbn  Rawahah!  You  would recite poetry in front of Allah\u2019s Messenger and at the Haram  of  Allah?!\u201d  So  the  Prophet  \uf067  said  to  him, \u201cLeave him alone, \u2018Umar, for [such words] pass more quickly  through  them  than  a  barrage  of  arrows.\u201d\nAnd  just  as  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  \uf067  rejoiced  when Khalid \u2013 the military leader \u2013 accepted Islam, he also rejoiced  when  one  of  the  greatests  poets  accepted Islam.  When  the  delegation  of  the  Ansar  came  for the  bay\u2019ah  of  \u2018Aqabah,  he  said  to  al-\u2018Abbas,  \u201cDo you  know  these  two  men?\u201d  When  he  turned,  he said, \u201cYes, this is al-Bara Ibn Ma\u2019rur, the chief of his people, and this is Ka\u2019b Ibn Malik.\u201d Ka\u2019b said, \u201cBy Allah, I will not forget the word of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067  when  he  asked,  \u2018The  poet?\u2019\u201d  Al-\u2018Abbas  replied, \u201cYes\u201d (Reported by Ahmad). It was also related that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 would prepare his poets well, as he said to Hassan Ibn Thabit, \u201cGo to Abu Bakr and have him teach you the faults of the people, for he is knowledgeable of lineages\u201d (Al-Bayhaqi: Lubab alAnsab). Hassan sought permission from the Prophet \uf067 to poetically insult the mushrikin [of Quraysh], to which he replied, \u201cHow about my lineage?\u201d Hassan said,  \u201cI  will  spare  you  from  them  just  as  a  hair  is pulled  out  from  dough\u201d  (Reported  by  al-Bukhari from  \u2018Aishah).  And  the  Prophet  \uf067  enjoyed  good poetry. He said, \u201cThe most truthful word spoken by a  poet  is  the  word  of  Labid,  \u2018Alas,  everything  save Allah  is  of  no  avail,\u2019  and  Umayyah  Ibn  Abis-Salt nearly entered into Islam\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and  Muslim  from  Abu  Hurayrah).\nLikewise,  he  \uf067  made  Thabit  Ibn  Qays  Ibn Shammas \u2013 one of those who were promised Jannah \u2013 a spokesman to speak out for Islam and the Muslims. So  when  Bani  Tamim  came  with  their  spokesman and  poet,  the  Prophet  \uf067  said  to  Thabit  Ibn  Qays, \u201cStand and reply to him.\u201d Thabit then responded. At that, al-Aqra\u2019 Ibn Habis said, \u201cIndeed, Muhammad is \n\f", "schema:headline": "The Siyahah of Jihad", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "19"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah10-Establishing-the-Islamic-State:-Part-4", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "In  the  last  part  of  this  series  of  articles,  we  provided a glimpse at the history and the origin of the religion of the Rafidah on the basis of the false theory of \u201cal-imamah al-ilahiyyah\u201d (the divine imamah), and the theories derived from it, such as \u201cwasiyyah\u201d (inherited authority), \u201cnass\u201d (verbatim appointment), \u201ctaqiyyah\u201d (concealing the truth out of fear), \u201cbada\u201d (occurrence  of  an  idea),  \u201cghaybah\u201d  (prolonged  absence), \u201craj\u2019ah\u201d (reincarnation), and other kufri innovations  and  superstitions.\nAnd we shall attempt in this series \u2013 by Allah\u2019s permission \u2013 to explain how the Rafidah were compelled to  play  with  the  theory  of  al-imamah  al-ilahiyyah, \nwhich they made a condition for the establishment of the Islamic State, and how they added modification after modification upon that until they arrived at the theory of \u201cwilayat al-faqih\u201d (the leadership of the jurist), which abrogated the foundations of their original theories, and which the shirki Iranian state is founded upon today, and which they seek to spread throughout all the Muslim lands.\nIn contrast to the claims of the Rafidah that their religion  is  revelation  from  the  heavens  upon  Allah\u2019s Messenger, Muhammad g, and that it reached them in stages by way of \u2018Ali Ibn Abi Talib \uf068 and his sons, and which they even wrote down on sheets of paper \n20ARTICLE\nARTICLE\fhaving tread the path of jihad and then turned back \u2013 call to deserting the mujahidin.

He was known among his companions for his humility and his lack of desire for the Dunya. He was a devout worshiper who would pray at night and fast during the day, and who would recite the Quran,  memorize it, and  contemplate  it. These were his deeds and  his  habits  in his  daily  life  in  the land  of  jihad.  He would  likewise  be gracious in assisting the brothers, whether in the kitchen or elsewhere,  and  he would not forget to remember  Allah  at all  times.  This  was how  he  remained until  he  was  honored with shahadah. His  good  conduct and his kindness towards  the  Muslims made  him  beloved among the brothers, his severe enmity and rage towards  the  kuffar  led  to  him  being  pursued  by  his enemies, and the strength of his resolve and might terrorized the criminals of the taghut government in his  land.\nWhen he heard the call to jihad, he set out, responding to the call of Allah and His Messenger. He made hijrah to the Philippines in \u201c2006\u201d and joined the ranks of the mujahidin in the Abu Sayyaf Islamic movement \u2013 which, at the time, was under the leadership of Shaykh Khadaffy Janjalani \uf08a \u2013 with brothers from Indonesia and Malaysia. He waged jihad with them for a short period and then returned to his land and his place of birth in Sabah, carrying with him the manhaj of jihad and determined to open a jihad front there. However, Allah decreed that he would be detained and imprisoned by the taghut of Malaysia. He remained in prison for two years with patience and  steadfastness,  despite  the  plots  of  the  enemies, from among the scholars of evil who call to the gates of Hellfire and the abandonment of jihad and its illuminated path, and from among those who \u2013 after \nABU SABAH \uf08a JOINED THE MUJAHIDIN IN EAST ASIA WHO WOULD GO ON TO GIVE BAY\u2019AH TO THE KHILAFAH\none another to remain patient and steadfast, and he would always make du\u2019a for Allah to return him to the ranks of the mujahidin.\nIn the year \u201c2008,\u201d he came out of prison, and the taghut government of Malaysia continued to monitor him wherever he went, but he did not weaken and did not despair of joining the ranks of the mujahidin once again, and in the year \u201c2011\u201d Allah granted him the blessing of making hijrah once more to the Philippines. The taghut Malaysian government was enraged when it found out that he had reached the land of jihad in the Philippines, and it later joined the Crusader Filipino government in its war against the mujahidin there. But no matter how harsh the situation became for the mujahidin on account of the kuffar,  they  remained  patient,  having  certainty  in Allah\u2019s promise, and their hardships did not increase them in anything but love for their mujahid brothers and enmity towards their kafir enemy.\nAfter  a  long  period  of  jihad,  trials,  and  tribulations,  there  came  to  them  the  good  tidings  of  the establishment  of  the  Islamic  State,  the  hope  and \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Establishing the Islamic State: Part 4", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "19"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah8-The-Story-of-Abu-Sulayman-ash-Shami", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "There is no benefit in a scholar who conceals his knowledge, neither proclaiming the truth nor calling others to it.

May Allah\u2019s  blessings  and  peace  be  upon  His Messenger,  the  Imam  of  the  righteous  \u2013 whom Allah made both an imam for the people  that  rules  them  with  what  Allah has revealed, and an imam for the people to  follow  with  respect  to  their  religion, and whose rightly-guided successors Allah then  placed  upon  his  methodology  and path  \u2013  and  may  His  blessings  and  peace be upon his family, his companions, and those who follow them in goodness until the Day of Judgment. As for what follows:Imam  Ahmad  and  al-Hakim,  along with Ibn Hibban in his sahih, reported the hadith  of  Abu  Umamah  h,  that  Allah\u2019s Messenger  g  said,  \u201cYou  will  certainly undo the bonds of Islam one by one. Every time  a  bond  is  undone,  the  people  will cling to the one that follows. The first to be undone will be hukm (ruling) and the last of them will be the prayer.\u201d\nSo  the  greater  shar\u2019i  imamah  is  from among  the  bonds  of  Islam,  and  undoing the  affair  of  ruling  with  what  Allah  has revealed  is  a  deficiency  that  affects  the Muslims in  both  their  religious  and worldly affairs, for how many branches of Islam and iman cannot be achieved except through  this  particular  bond  of  Islam! And  the  task  of  ruling  with  what  Allah has  revealed  can  only  be  undertaken  by the ruler and the scholars of the Shari\u2019ah, who  aid  him  and  advise  him.  Allah  g said,  \u201cIndeed,  We  sent  down  the  Torah, in  which  was  guidance  and  light.  The prophets who submitted [to Allah] judged by  it  for  the  Jews,  as  did  the  rabbis  and scholars  by  that  with  which  they  were entrusted  of  the  Scripture  of  Allah,  and they  were  witnesses  thereto\u201d  (Al-Maidah 44). So Allah g clarified that it was the prophets  whom  He  commissioned  with the task of ruling with what He revealed, and  they  were  the  ones  who  would  lead \nBani Israil, as the Prophet g said, \u201cThe prophets would lead Bani Israil, and every time a prophet passed away, another prophet would succeed him. And indeed, there is no prophet after me. There will be khulafa and they will  be  many.\u201d  They  (i.e.  the  Sahabah)  said,  \u201cWhat  do you order us to do?\u201d He said \u201cFulfill your bay\u2019ah to the [one  given  bay\u2019ah]  first,  and  give  them  their  right,  for indeed  Allah  will  ask  them  about  that  which  He  has given  them  guardianship  over\u201d  (Reported  by  Muslim). So  the  khulafa  take  the  role  of  the  prophets  in  ruling the people with what Allah has revealed, and the pious scholars are their helpers in that regard.\nThe Rightly-Guided Khilafah Inherits the \nProphetic Methodology\nIndeed,  from  the  most  important  of  responsibilities of the Khilafah in this era is to renew the religion and establish it upon the prophetic methodology, as promised by  our  prophet g  in  his  statement,  \u201cProphethood  will remain  among  you  for  as  long  as  Allah  wills  for  it  to remain.  Then,  He  will  lift  it  when  He  wills  to  lift it.  Then,  there  will  be  khilafah  upon  the  prophetic methodology,  and  it  will  remain  for  as  long  as  Allah wills  for  it  to  remain.  Then,  He  will  lift  it  when  He wills to lift it. Then, there will be biting kingship, and it will remain for as long as Allah wills for it to remain. Then,  He  will  lift  it  when  He  wills  to  lift  it.  Then, there  will  be  oppressive  kingship,  and  it  will  remain for  as  long  as  Allah  wills  for  it  to  remain.  Then,  He will lift it when He wills to lift it. Then, there will be khilafah upon the prophetic methodology\u201d (Reported by Ahmad).  So  the  Khilafah  that  is  sought  is  that  which is  upon  the  prophetic  methodology,  and  the  Khilafah upon the prophetic methodology is that which achieves the  description  of  rushd  (right  guidance),  which  is  the description given to the Khilafah of the leading group of the companions of Allah\u2019s Messenger g.\nAnd a khilafah can only be described with rushd if \u2013 by Allah\u2019s permission \u2013 the khalifah follows the Book of Allah and the guidance of our prophet, Muhammad g, in all affairs and in all circumstances.\nRushd  has  various  meanings  in  the  Book  of  Allah g,  and  among  its  greatest  meanings  is  the  grace  and guidance  of  Allah g  for  those  of  His  slaves  whom  He loves:  \u201cAnd  know  that  among  you  is  the  Messenger  of Allah. If he were to obey you in much of the matter, you would  be  in  difficulty,  but  Allah  has  endeared  to  you the faith and has made it pleasing in your hearts and has made hateful to you disbelief, defiance and disobedience. \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Take Advantage of Your Spare Time before You Become Occupied", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "9"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3-Among-the-Believers-Are-Men:\rAbu-\u2018Abdillah-al-Britaini-\r", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "3", "schema:articleBody": "Abu \u2018Abdillah was a very sociable, lively, friendly, gentle person with a soft heart and a blessed smile. He was one of those characters whom everyone liked. He was never arrogant, regardless of whatever position he held. He was always humble towards others and would recognize his own mistakes and faults, and it was for this reason that he was dearly loved by many.Anyone who saw him could not help but to be reminded of wala and bara and see the love and concern he had for the religion and the Ummah. He was gentle towards the believers and harsh towards the kuffar, with his severity towards kufr and its people being a trait of his that was internationally known, due to his many efforts in giving global da\u2019wah, making him an inspiration for many Muslims around the world. The fact that he was active in da\u2019wah, however, didn\u2019t reduce him to being someone who just talked on and on  without  backing  up  his  words  with  deeds,  as  is the case with many du\u2019at nowadays. Rather, he was a man of action who not only \u201ctalked the talk,\u201d but also \u201cwalked the walk.\u201d\nHe  was  very  brave  hearted,  someone  who  stood firm and remained sincere in what he called for, not fearing the blame of critics. He had a strong determination and stubbornness in following the truth and was swift to sacrifice what he held dear, seeking Allah\u2019s contentment, spending both his wealth and his life for the sake of Allah \uf063.\nHe was born and raised in Britain, the youngest of five siblings. One can imagine the mischief and cor-\nExclusive\nruption a young man can fall into growing up in the lands of the Crusaders, where evil and corruption is widespread and where the ills of society are glamorized. It was the events of 9/11 that would inspire him to begin studying and practicing his religion. He then began preaching Islam to people, calling them to the tawhid of Allah \uf062, publically condemning the British government for the many  atrocities  committed  against  Muslims  both  locally  and abroad, and calling for the implementation of Allah\u2019s Shari\u2019ah and the revival of the Khilafah.1 Due to his da\u2019wah, he not only became well known in the community, but also became well known to the British authorities. Rather than deterring him or frightening him, however, this only spurred him on and made him more determined to call to the truth.\nThe Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cHe who possesses three characteristics has tasted the sweetness of iman: That Allah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than anything else, that he loves a person, only loving him for Allah\u2019s sake, and that he hates returning to \n1   This was prior to the Khilafah\u2019s eventual revival in the year 1435AH with the appointment of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi \uf085 as the Khalifah, an event that Abu \u2018Abdillah would witness as a soldier of the Islamic State. He thus not only called for the revival of the Khilafah, but translated his words into deeds by fighting to bring it back.\n\fand that He has no partner in legislation. The evidences for tawhid in rule and legislation are very numerous.\nThe  author  of  \u201cAdwa  al-Bayan\u201d  said,  \u201cCommitting shirk in Allah\u2019s rule is like committing shirk in His worship. Allah said concerning His rule, \u2018He does not have shirk in His rule with anyone\u2019 (Al-Kahf 26). In the recitation of Ibn \u2018Amir, one of the seven reciters, it comes in the form of a forbiddance: \u2018Do not commit shirk with anyone in His rule.\u2019 Likewise, Allah said concerning the act of committing shirk in His worship, \u2018Whoever longs to meet His Lord \u2013 let him do righteous deeds and not commit shirk with anyone in the worship of his Lord\u2019 (Al-Kahf 110). Both commands are equal, as is clearly seen.\u201d\nHe then said, \u201cWhat this noble verse entails \u2013 that rule belongs to Allah alone, without partner, according to both recitations \u2013 has been further explained in other verses.\u201d  He  then  mentioned  from  among  them  Allah\u2019s statement, \u201cThe rule is only for Allah. He has commanded that you worship only Him. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know\u201d (Yusuf 40), and His statement, \u201cIs it the rule of Jahiliyyah they want? But who is better than Allah in rule for a people who have firm faith\u201d (Al-Maidah 50), and His statement, \u201cIs it other than Allah I should seek as a judge while it is He who has revealed to you the Book explained in detail?\u201d (Al-An\u2019am  114).\nHe then said, \u201cWhat is understood from these verses\u2026 is that the followers of the rulings of lawmakers who legislate  what  Allah  has  not  permitted  are  committing shirk  with  Allah.  This  understanding  was  made  clear in  other  verses,  such  as  in  Allah\u2019s  statement  concerning those who follow Shaytan\u2019s legislation in permitting maytah [the meat of unslaughtered animals] under the pretext that they were slaughtered by Allah: \u2018Do not eat of that upon which the name of Allah has not been mentioned, for indeed, it is grave disobedience. Indeed the devils inspire their awliya [patrons] to dispute with you, and  if  you  were  to  obey  them,  indeed,  you  would  be mushrikin\u2019 (Al-An\u2019am 121). So he declared them to be mushrikin due to their obedience [to taghut legislation], and this shirk in obedience \u2013 following legislation that rivals what Allah has legislated \u2013 is what is meant by worshiping Shaytan in Allah\u2019s statement, \u2018Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Shaytan \u2013 [for] indeed, he is a clear enemy to you \u2013 and that you worship [only] Me? This is a straight path\u2019 (Yasin 60-61).\u201d\nHe then said, \u201cFor this reason, Allah named as \u2018shuraka\u2019 [partners] those who are obeyed in the sins they beautify. He \uf063 said, \u2018Likewise, the \u2018shuraka\u2019 of the mushrikin have beautified to them the killing of their children in order to bring about their destruction and to mislead them in  their  religion.  And  if  Allah  had  willed,  they  would not  have  done  so.  So  leave  them  and  that  which  they devise\u2019 (Al-An\u2019am 137). The Prophet \uf067 explained this to \u2018Adiy Ibn Hatim \uf068 when \u2018Adiy asked about Allah\u2019s statement,  \u2018They  took  their  rabbis  and  monks  as  lords besides Allah\u2019 (At-Tawbah 31). The Prophet \uf067 explained to  him  that  the  clergy  permitted  for  them  what  Allah \nhad prohibited, and prohibited for them what Allah had permitted, and the Jews and Christians followed them in that regard, and that was their taking of their clergy as lords. From the most explicit of evidences concerning this is that Allah \uf065 explained in Surat an-Nisa that He is amazed at the claim of faith from those who want to seek judgment from what Allah has not legislated, and that is only because their claim of having faith despite their desire to seek judgment from taghut reaches a level of lying so great that it is amazing, and this is in His statement, \u2018Have you not seen those who claim to have believed in what was revealed to you and what was revealed before you? They wish to seek judgment from taghut, while they were commanded to disbelieve in it; and Shaytan wishes to lead them far astray\u2019 (An-Nisa 60). Through these divine texts we have quoted, it becomes absolutely clear that none doubts the kufr and shirk of those who follow the  manmade  laws  which  Shaytan  has  legislated  upon the tongues of his allies in opposition to what Allah \uf065 has legislated upon the tongue of His messengers \uf070 except one whose vision Allah has wiped out and whom He has blinded from seeing the light of the revelation like He did to the followers of the taghut legislators\u201d (Adwa al-Bayan).\nAs  for  Allah\u2019s  statement,  \u201cIs  it  other  than  Allah  I should seek as a judge while it is He who has revealed to you the Book explained in detail?\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 114), then in pondering it there are many benefits. The author of \u201cAdwa al-Bayan\u201d said, \u201cSome scholars mentioned that some of the kuffar asked the Prophet \uf067 to seek judgment along with them from some of the soothsayers, as it was the custom of the Arabs \u2013 when they had disputes and disagreements \u2013 to seek judgment from some of the soothsayers, and Allah\u2019s refuge is sought.\u201d Allah \uf065 then revealed this verse and ordered the Prophet \uf067 \u201cto completely denounce those who seek a judge other than the Creator  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  who  is  the  Just Judge,  the  Subtly  Kind,  the  All  Aware\u201d  (Al-\u2018Adhb  anNamir).\nA similar verse is found in Surat al-An\u2019am. Allah \uf063 said,  \u201cSay,  \u2018Is  it  other  than  Allah  \u2013  the  Creator  of  the heavens and the earth \u2013 I should take as a wali [guardian], while it is He who feeds and is not fed?\u2019 Say, \u2018Indeed, I have been commanded to be the first who submits [to Allah] and [was commanded], \u2018Do not ever be of the mushrikin\u2019\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 14). He \uf063 also said, \u201cSay, \u2018Is it other than Allah I should want as a lord while He is the Lord of all things? No soul does evil except against itself, and no one shall bear another\u2019s burden. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ\u2019\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 164). He \uf065 also said in Surat al-A\u2019raf, \u201c[Musa] said, \u2018Is it other than Allah I should seek as a god for you while He has chosen you over all creation?\u2019\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 140).\nIbnul-Qayyim \uf072 said, \u201cOne\u2019s being pleased with Allah as his lord means that he does not take a lord other than Allah, trusting in its management of affairs and appealing  to  it  for  his  needs.  Allah  \uf063  said,  \u2018Say,  \u2018Is  it other  than  Allah  I  should  want  as  a  [rabb]  lord  while He is the Lord of creation?\u2019 (Al-An\u2019am 164).

The tawaghit have taken them away from the true religion, at times through the means of the scholars of misguidance, and at times through the means of their corrupt media, which had them showing allegiance to the tawaghit and showing enmity to the mujahidin under the pretext of countering terrorism. And this is an apparent act of apostasy from the religion of Islam, so it is upon them to hasten to repent from it, and thereafter it is upon them to not expose the mujahidin\u2019s secrets, and to cover them.

Yes, the soldiers of the Islamic State \u2013 without exception \u2013 are all prepared to  fight  in  the  cause  of  Allah  down  to  their  last drop  of  blood.

He also clarified what there was of severe poverty and widespread illnesses in Madinah, as well as the fear that used to govern the lives of the Muslims in this blessed state, so much so that they didn\u2019t feel safe from the kuffar outside the state invading them, nor from the munafiqin inside the state betraying them, and much more aside from  that  from  among  the  signs  of  weakness  which nevertheless did not detract a single bit from the value of the state of the Prophet g, nor from the obligation on the Muslims to always endeavor to make it their goal to establish a state in the same mold and to tread upon its methodology.\nFor this reason, when the Islamic State of Iraq was established, the followers of the deviant groups and the parties of fitnah were among the first to defame it, and what they used to criticize about it most was the poverty it  contained  and  the  mushrikin\u2019s  ability  to  kill  and imprison its soldiers, turning a blind eye to the condition which the state of the Prophet gwas in, and ignoring the fact that a state only becomes an Islamic state due to the rulings of the Shari\u2019ah being superior therein, and not due to the number of gold bars or piles of dollar bills in the coffers of its central bank, nor due to the size of its army or the number of planes flying in its skies.\nThe Sahabah\u2019s Society\u2026The Best Ummah Brought \nForth for Mankind\nLikewise,  the  deviants  who  associate  themselves with Islam persisted in their lies and in distorting the reality of an Islamic state, altering the characteristics of its people by depicting them as being angels who neither sin nor make mistakes, and who never transgress against one another, and who have no dunya-related concerns, and who are simply busy with worship, dhikr, praying, and fasting. So they painted this fanciful image of the Muslim society, and in reality, this society which they painted in the minds of their followers had never existed before on the earth for a single day, nor will it ever exist until Allah inherits the earth and those upon it. And \nit  is  not  required  that  a  society  fulfill  those  fanciful conditions  in  order  to  merit  the  description  of  being Islamic. Rather, it is sufficient for a society that Islam is what is manifested by the majority of its people and that they are ruled by the shari\u2019ah of Islam.\nIndeed,  the  society  of  the  companions  of  Allah\u2019s Messenger gis the best society to have ever existed on the earth, and those who lived in this society were among the best of the creation of Allah c. Allah c said, \u201cYou are  the  best  nation  brought  forth  for  mankind.  You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah. If only the People of the Scripture had believed, it would have been better for them. Among them are believers, but most of them are defiantly disobedient\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 110). And the companions of the Prophet Muhammad  g  are  better  than  the  companions  and disciples of the previous prophets, and there has never been in any society in terms of submitting to the rule of Allah the likes of that which was found in the society of the Sahabah. And without any doubt, it is a shar\u2019i obligation  for  any  society  of  Muslims  to  endeavor  to become  like  the  society  of  the  companions  of  Allah\u2019s Messenger  g  in  terms  of  their  iman,  their  worship, their justice, their concern in practicing the Sunnah, and their  jihad.\nBut if in the society of Muslims there exist people who make mistakes, or people who disobey Allah  c or who fall into committing oppression, or there occurs something  of  dispute  over  some  aspect  of  this  base dunya, or the Muslims are infiltrated by munafiqin \u2013 whether they are few or many in number \u2013 this does not negate the goodness of that society, nor do these issues detract from that society\u2019s Islamic nature as long as the good that is found within it is prevalent and the evil that it contains is fought, and as long as the justice that is found within it is prevalent and the injustice it contains is fought.\nAnd  we  can  go  back  to  the  ideal  society  \u2013  the society  of  the  Sahabah  \uf06a  \u2013  in  order  to  see  an example of this society\u2019s human nature, for among the Sahabah were people who made mistakes and sought forgiveness, and disobeyed Allah and repented. And among them were people who associated themselves with them but in reality were not from among them. On the surface, they were Muslims, but on the inside, they were disbelievers. Among them were many who died upon nifaq, and being members of this righteous society did not benefit them in any way, nor did their companionship of the leader of mankind g benefit them.\nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Foreword", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah8-Military-and-Covert-Operations", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "As the soldiers of the Khilafah continue waging war on the forces of kufr, we take a glimpse at a number of  recent  operations  conducted  by  the  mujahidin  of the Islamic State that have succeeded in expanding the territory of the Khilafah, or terrorizing, massacring, and  humiliating  the  enemies  of  Allah.  These  operations  are  merely  a  selection  of  the  numerous  operations that the Islamic State has conducted on various fronts across many regions over the course of the last few weeks.\nJazair Wilayah\nOn the 28th of Jumada al-Ula, one of the soldiers of  the  Khilafah  in  Jazair  \uf08a  set  out  and  conducted an istishhadi operation using an explosives-laden bag with which he targeted a police station belonging to the murtadd Jazairi police force in the middle of the city of Qusantinah.\nSalahuddin Wilayah\nOn the 1st of Jumada al-Akhirah, three inghimasi soldiers of the Khilafah, Abu Salih al-\u2018Iraqi, Abul-Yaman al-\u2018Iraqi, and Abu Fuad al-\u2018Iraqi \uf08d, set out with their explosive vests towards an intelligence base belonging  to  the  Rafidi  Salam  Detachments  militia on  the  outskirts  of  the  city  of  Samarra.  They  infiltrated the base, following which fierce clashes broke out that led to all those inside the base being killed. The inghimasiyyin then confronted a Rafidi convoy of  reinforcements,  and  after  exhausting  their  supply of ammo, they detonated their explosive vests on the murtaddin. The blessed operation resulted in 27 murtaddin being killed and wounded, and among those dead  was  the  intelligence  base  officer,  Abu  Mahdi. This was in addition to the buildings and vehicles suffering  an  extensive  amount  of  damage.\nOn  the  9th  of  Jumada  al-Akhirah,  two  soldiers of  the  Khilafah,  Abu  \u2018Abdillah  ash-Shami  and  Abu \n26News\n\fpointed to the blessing of health in what was reported by al-Bukhari in his al-Adab al-Mufrad and the other books of as-Sunan where the Prophet says, \u201cWhoever awakens secure with regards to his self, has his body in good health, and has his food for that day, it is as if he possesses the Dunya.\u201d Likewise, Imam al-Bukhari r reported in his sahih that Ibn \u2018Abbas k narrated that the Prophet g said, \u201cThere are two blessings that many  people  are  heedless  of:  health  and  free  time.\u201d Ibnul-Battal r says, while explaining this magnificent hadith, \u201cThe meaning of the hadith is that a person doesn\u2019t have free time until his needs are sufficed and his body is healthy. So whoever achieves that, then let him be vigilant not to become heedless in thanking Allah for what He has blessed him with, and from the means of giving Him thanks is to act upon His commands and abstain from what He has forbidden. So whoever is neglectful concerning that is heedless.\u201d\nThe Prohibition of Spoiling the Body\nWhat is strange with some people is that they spoil their health with that which Allah c has prohibited of  the  destructive  and  evil  things,  such  as  cigarettes and  intoxicants  that  make  absent  the  intellect  and cripple it in varying degrees, and which severely harm the body. Such things, and others from among that which is prohibited are a slow death, and a means of destroying the body, and Allah c forbade killing oneself when He said, \u201cAnd do not kill yourselves. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful\u201d (An-Nisa 29). And as such,  the  venerable  Shari\u2019ah  came  to  safeguard  the religion and the people, and for the sake of religion people  are  sacrificed  cheaply  by  way  of  jihad  in  Allah\u2019s cause until there is no more fitnah and all of the religion is for Allah. Apart from that, it is not permissible  for  the  Muslim  to  inflict  harm  upon  his  body or do something that harms his health, whatever the reason may be. Al-Hakim reported in his Mustadrak, from Jabir, that a man from the people of at-Tufayl Ibn  \u2018Amr  ad-Dawsi  made  hijrah  with  at-Tufayl  and then  became  sick.  He  said,  \u201cHe  became  discontent, so  he  came  to  a  quiver,  took  an  arrow,  and  cut  the veins in his hands and died. At-Tufayl saw him in a dream  and  said,  \u2018What  did  Allah  do  with  you?\u2019  He said, \u2018He forgave me due to my hijrah to the Prophet g.\u2019 So he said, \u2018What happened to your hands?\u2019 He said, \u2018It was said to me, \u2018We will not repair what you have corrupted of yourself.\u2019\u2019 So at-Tufayl narrated the story to the Prophet g and he g said, \u2018O Allah, and \nforgive him for his hands,\u2019 and he raised his hands.\u201d So that was a man who didn\u2019t intend to kill himself, however his action led to his death, and Allah forgave him due to his hijrah, as that is what is apparent from the supplication of the Prophet g for him. Therefore, contemplate what was said to him: \u201cI will not repair what you have corrupted of yourself,\u201d for this body is not to be ruined except in pursuit of Allah\u2019s pleasure and in maintaining obedience to Him, not due to the whims of the soul and its pleasures and impulses.\nPatience upon Sickness\u2026 A Sunnah of \nthe Prophets and the Manhaj of the Righteous\nBetween the blessing of health and the blessing of being  cured,  it  is  essential  for  every  Muslim  to  put their trust in their Lord and to utilize the means for remedy. If he is cured then verily it is from Allah alone, and if he does not recover then he should think well of his Lord \u2013 in that He wills by it to raise his station and erase his sins by means of all of that which befalls him from the different types of physical and mental harm. Therefore, the Muslim seeks his reward through patience  in  the  face  of  affliction,  for  that  is  the  situation  of  the  believer  in  both  easy  and  hard  times. Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported that the Prophet g said, \u201cNothing afflicts the Muslim of fatigue, illness, anxiety, grief, harm, or depression \u2013 even if it were the prick of a thorn \u2013 except that Allah expiates by that his sins.\u201d Due to this, some of the Salaf would rejoice if they fell sick, for verily those tested most severely are the prophets, then those resembling them, and then those resembling them. Imam al-Bukhari reported in his sahih from al-Harith Ibn Suwayd, from \u2018Abdullah that he said, \u201cI entered upon the Messenger of Allah g while he was suffering from fever, so I wiped him and said, \u2018Verily you are suffering a severe fever.\u2019 So he said, \u2018Verily, I suffer the likes of what two of you suffer.\u2019 I said, \u2018Is that because for you are two rewards?\u2019 He said, \u2018Indeed it is so. Likewise, there is no Muslim who is afflicted with harm \u2013 a pricking of a thorn or more than that \u2013 except that Allah expiates by it his sins just as a tree drops its leaves.\u2019\u201d Likewise, the Prophet of Allah Ayyub n was struck with an ailment that afflicted him for a prolonged time, and Allah c praised  him  for  his  patience.  He  said,  \u201cIndeed,  We found him patient, an excellent slave. Indeed, he was one repeatedly turning back (to Allah)\u201d (Sad 44). He then supplicated to Allah his Lord, but not in a direct  manner.  Rather,  it  was  with  excellent  manners \n\f", "schema:headline": "Military and Covert Operations", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "25"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah7-Rely-on-Allah,-Not-on-Your-Equipment", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "No  two  Muslims  would  disagree  that  preparing for jihad for the cause of Allah is an obligation.

He should not be tempted by this power in any way, because even if readiness is one of the factors of victory, being conceited with it is a factor of defeat.\nWe have a good example in the life of the Sahabah of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067. We also have a lesson from what they went through on the Day of Hunayn. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cAllah has already given you victory in many arenas and on the Day of Hunayn, when your great number pleased you, but it did not avail you at all, and the earth was confining for you with its vastness; then you turned back, fleeing. Then Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers and sent down soldiers whom you did not see and punished those who disbelieved. And that is the \nArticle\fConcerning  the  statement  of  Allah  \uf063,  \u201cOnly those of His slaves who have knowledge fear Allah\u201d (Fatir 28), Ibn Taymiyyah \uf072 said, \u201cThe meaning is that none fears Him except a scholar, for Allah has informed us that everyone who fears Allah is a scholar, as He stated in another ayah: \u2018Is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night, prostrating and standing  [in  prayer],  mindful  of  the  Hereafter  and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, [like one who does not]? Say, \u2018Are those who know equal to those who do not know?\u2019 It is only the people of understanding who will remember\u2019 (Az-Zumar 9). Fear always comprises hope, and if not for that it would have been security. So those who fear Allah and have hope in Him are the people of knowledge whom Allah has aided.\n\u201cIt  has  been  narrated  that  Abu  Hayyan  at-Taymi  said,  \u2018The  scholars  are  of  three  types:  One  who is knowledgeable of Allah but not knowledgeable of Allah\u2019s affair, one who is knowledgeable of Allah\u2019s affair  but  not  knowledgeable  of  Allah,  and  one  who is knowledgeable of Allah and knowledgeable of Allah\u2019s affair. The one who is knowledgeable of Allah is the one who fears Him, and the one who is knowledgeable of Allah\u2019s affair is the one who knows His commands and prohibitions.\u2019 Likewise, the Prophet \uf067 said, \u2018Indeed, I hope to be the most fearful of Allah among you and the most knowledgeable of that which he is mindful of\u2019 (Reported by Muslim from \u2018Aishah).\n\u201cIf those who fear Allah are the scholars, who are praised in the Book and the Sunnah, then they do not deserve to be disparaged, and this is only the case if they perform the obligatory deeds. This is indicated by the statement of Allah \uf063, \u2018So their Lord inspired to them, \u2018We will surely destroy the wrongdoers. And We  will  surely  cause  you  to  dwell  in  the  land  after them. That is for he who fears My position and fears My  threat\u2019\u2019  (Ibrahim  13-14).  This  is  also  indicated by  His  statement,  \u2018And  for  he  who  fears  the  position  of  his  Lord  are  two  gardens\u2019  (Ar-Rahman  46). So  He  promised  victory  in  the  Dunya  and  reward in the Hereafter for those who feared Him, and this is only because they performed what was obligatory upon them. This is evidence that fear necessitates the performance of that which is obligatory, and for this reason it is said that an immoral person does not fear Allah. The evidence for this is the statement of Allah \uf063, \u2018The repentance accepted by Allah is only for those who do wrong in ignorance [or carelessness] and then repent soon after\u2019 (An-Nisa 17).\nOne Knowledgeable of Allah Will Obey Him\n\u201cAbul-\u2018Aliyah  said,  \u2018I  asked  the  companions  of Muhammad about this ayah, and they said, \u2018Everyone who disobeys Allah is ignorant, and anyone who repents before death has repented soon after [his sin].\u2019\u2019 And the rest of the scholars of tafsir have stated likewise.  Mujahid  said,  \u2018Every  sinner  is  ignorant  at  the time of committing his sin.\u2019 Likewise, al-Hasan, Qatadah, \u2018Ata, as-Suddi, and others have said, \u2018They were only called ignorant due to their sins, and not because they  couldn\u2019t  distinguish  [between  good  and  evil].\u2019 Az-Zajjaj said, \u2018The meaning of the ayah isn\u2019t that they were ignorant of it being something evil, because if a Muslim commits a sin that he is ignorant of, he is like one who has not committed any evil. So it is only one of two possibilities: The first is that they committed it  while  ignorant  of  the  disliked  matter  it  contains. The second is that they committed it while knowing and comprehending that its consequence is disliked, preferring what they would gain from it immediately over what they would gain in the Hereafter [from leaving it], and as such they were called ignorant for preferring that which is little over abundant comfort and permanent wellbeing.\u2019 Here, az-Zajjaj has made ignorance to be either not knowing the consequence of the deed, or being corrupt in what one desires. It might be said that these two things are related, and this is further expounded on in the discussion about the  Jahmiyyah.\n\u201cWhat is intended here is that everyone who disobeys Allah is ignorant, and anyone who fears Him is a scholar who is obedient to Allah, and one only becomes ignorant due to a decrease in his fear of Allah, because if one\u2019s fear of Allah had been complete he would not have sinned. Likewise, there is the statement of Ibn Mas\u2019ud \uf068, \u2018It is sufficient in terms of knowledge for one to fear Allah, and it is sufficient in terms of ignorance for one to be deceived concerning Allah.\u2019 This is because envisioning the object of one\u2019s fear necessitates fleeing from it, and envisioning the  object  of  one\u2019s  love  necessitates  seeking  it,  so  if one does not flee from the first and does not seek the second, it indicates that he has not envisioned it completely. He might, however, envision what is reported about it, but envisioning what is reported, affirming it, and memorizing its letters is not the same as envisioning that which is being reported about. Likewise is the case if he neither loves nor hates that which he envisions, for the human being may affirm that which \n\f", "schema:headline": "Rely on Allah, Not on Your Equipment", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "11"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah8-Those-Who-Seek-the-Judgment-of-the-Tawaghit", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "Allah  c  said,  \u201cDid  you  not  see  those  who  claim they believe in what was revealed to you and what was revealed before you, (yet) they want to seek judgment from taghut, though they were ordered to disbelieve therein,  and  Shaytan  wants  to  lead  them  far  astray.

So  how  then, when an affliction struck them due to what their own hands brought forth, they then came to you, swearing by Allah, \u2018We did not want anything but well-doing and successful outcome\u2019\u201d (An-Nisa 60-62).\nWhoever  recognizes  that  there  is  no  god  except Allah  must  also  comply  with  His  hukm  (rule  and judgment) and submit to His command, which was brought forth from Him through His Messenger, Muhammad g. So whoever testifies that there is no god except Allah, and then defers to the judgment of other than the Messenger g in matters of dispute, then he has lied in his testimony.\nTawhid is based upon the two testimonies, and one is not said without the other due to their inseparability. And just as the testimony that, \u201cThere is no god except Allah,\u201d comprises the right of Allah over His slaves, \n34Article\n\fFor years following its establishment, the Khilafah has  called  on  Muslims  around  the  world  to  rise  up and wage jihad against the enemies of Allah in order to raise high His word, and to unite under the banner of the jama\u2019ah of the Muslims. This call was met with a forceful response as several groups of mujahidin around the world quickly closed ranks and declared their bay\u2019ah to Amirul-Muminin, with some of them uniting  with  other  mujahid  factions  in  their  region and nominating an individual from among themselves to be appointed by the Khalifah as their amir.\nThus,  the  Khilafah  quickly  expanded  beyond  its territories in Iraq and Sham, two lands from the lands of the Muslims that had been usurped by the Crusaders and carved up among themselves through the use of artificial borders that were upheld throughout the rule of their taghut puppets. The Khilafah expanded beyond Iraq and Sham after destroying their artificial border, uniting their territories, and establishing the Shari\u2019ah therein, thereby demonstrating that the Ummah\u2019s unity was not beyond reach, as long as it was pursued  on  the  basis  of  the  tawhid  of  Allah.  It  was this form of unity to which the Islamic State called the mujahidin \u2013 a form of unity that gave tawhid its proper due, as opposed to sacrificing it for the sake of temporary political gain \u2013 and it was this form of unity that the truthful mujahidin around the world had long awaited. So when the Khilafah made its call, the response  echoed  from  every  direction\u2026  from  Sinai, Libya, Jazair, Yemen, and the Arabian Peninsula.\nThe  mujahidin  were  being  mobilized  to  unite upon tawhid and to form a unified front against every mushrik in every corner of the earth, just as Allah c had commanded them, \u201cAnd fight the mushrikin collectively just as they fight you collectively\u201d (At-Tawbah 36). The war against kufr soon intensified as the mushrikin  rallied  in  an  attempt  to  stop  the  Islamic State\u2019s  expansion  and  bring  an  end  to  the  threat  it posed. But one after another the mujahid factions continued to unite under the Khilafah\u2019s banner. Khurasan, West Africa, Somalia, East Asia, Mali\u2026 the phenomenon swept through the lands of the Muslims, and in every  region  where  bay\u2019ah  was  given,  attacks  would follow. The mujahidin marched forth and struck the kuffar wherever they found them, not differentiating between a Crusading mushrik and a murtadd puppet.Such was the case when eight inghimasi soldiers of the Khilafah set out to raid a Russian National Guard base near the village of Naurskaya, northwest of the Chechen  city  of  Grozny  in  Qawqaz  Wilayah.  They \nused the foggy weather and the darkness of night to their advantage, advancing towards the military base, and the fact that they were armed with nothing but knives didn\u2019t make them hesitant in fighting the disbelieving enemies of Allah. Rather, it served as a sign of their truthfulness to Him. This small group of mujahidin \u2013 who spent ten days training for the operation \u2013 then attacked the soldiers in the base with their knives and  seized  their  weapons.  They  then  clashed  with them for several hours, killing at least six of them and injuring  three  others.  Six  of  the  mujahidin  attained shahadah during the course of the operation, and the remaining two returned safely back to their locations.The  daring  raid  on  the  Russian  base  in  Chechnya  coincided  with  another  operation  by  the  soldiers of the Khilafah several thousand kilometers away in Bengal. The istishhadi Abu Muhammad al-Bengali \uf08a made his way towards one of the checkpoints of the international airport in the city of Dhaka, where he entered into the midst of a group of murtadd Bengali policemen and detonated his explosive vest, killing at least three of them and injuring a number of others. Just one day later, dozens of murtadd Bengali forces personnel were killed and wounded when an explosive device was detonated on a group of them in the region of Sylhet as they were attempting to raid one of the mujahidin\u2019s bases. The soldiers of the Khilafah also carried out an operation a week prior, with one of the mujahidin targeting a special forces base in the area of Ashkuna located in Dhaka with an explosive vest.\nThe operations in Bengal and Qawqaz shook the ranks of the murtaddin and Crusaders, with the mujahidin in Bengal establishing their ability to confront and bleed the capabilities of the murtadd forces and target their most prominent commanders, as occurred in the operation in Sylhet, which resulted in the killing of the murtadd officer, Lieutenant Colonel Abul Kalam Azad, Director of Intelligence in Rapid Action Battalion. Likewise, the mujahidin in Qawqaz established their ability to target Russian Crusader forces and take them by surprise even in their military bases. These operations thus reminded all the sects of kufr that the battalions of the Islamic State in all corners of the earth will persist in their campaign to uproot their armies\u2019 forces wherever they\u2019re found, until the word of Allah is the highest and the word of the disbelievers is the lowest.\nMay  Allah  accept  our  shuhada  and  replace  them with those who will continue to carry the banner of tawhid  after  them.

Such attacks have been behind the destruction of towns, neighborhoods, and public, private, and governmental property, while likewise claiming numerous lives.\nRecently, on 15 Safar 1438AH, a soldier of the Khilafah stationed in Russia taught the despicable Crusaders a lesson on just how destructive an operation of such simplicity can be, successfully burning down a 3-story furniture factory in its entirety, as well as a chemical factory adjacent to it, both located in Losino-Petrovsky, a town northeast of Moscow. The fire was initiated on the ground floor, where it subsequently spread to the remaining floors and the neighboring buildings and continued to burn for three whole days, causing great financial losses for the Russian Crusaders.\nLikewise, the whole world witnessed the devastating fires that ravaged  Jewish  settlements  in  Palestine,  destroying  around  700 Jewish  homes.  Irrespective  of  the  motive,  this  deliberate  act  of destruction  demonstrated  the  lethality  of  such  an  effortless  operation. The attacks likewise demonstrate that with some simple \nArticle\fShaykh Zuwayd and its surrounding areas.\nAs for the Jariri tariqah, it has three main lodges. It has the Arab lodge in Isma\u2019iliyyah and the Sa\u2019ud lodge in the eastern region, and they are both in the land of Egypt. In Sinai, the tariqah has the Rawdah lodge, which many other lodges are affiliated with, such as the lodges in the neighborhood of Abu Jarir, and the areas of Tawil and Sabah, as well as others.\nThe  Ahmadi  tariqah  emerged  approximately  half  a century ago at the hands of Abu Ahmad al-\u2018Alawi al-Filistini, who came from Gaza. Its headquarters was in the area of Tumah, and the Jurah lodge is affiliated with it.\nWhen al-\u2018Alawi died, he bequeathed the lodge to his son  Mustafa  but  made  Khalaf  al-Khalfat  its  trustee  due to Mustafa\u2019s young age. From there, the taghut Khalaf became a head of the tariqah and Jurah became the mother-lodge. Then, this murtadd also died. He was buried in the Jurah lodge and his grave became a tomb with a green dome.\nAs for the Jariri tariqah, it was established by the taghut  \u2018Id  Abu  Jarir  and  was  centered  in  the  three  aforementioned lodges \u2013 the Sa\u2019ud lodge, the Arab lodge, and the Rawdah lodge \u2013 which the Islamic State will eradicate, inshaallah, as soon as it conquers the areas hosting those lodges.\nThe Jariri tariqah is more widespread and has more influence than the Ahmadi tariqah. It is also more extreme in deviance.\nQuestion: What are the worst practices of bid\u2019ah and \nshirk that these Sufi tariqas engage in?\nAnswer:  Shirk  has  become  very  widespread  in  the midst of these tariqas, to the extent that those senior in \nage grew old upon it, and those young in age were raised upon  it.  Indeed,  the  disaster  was  immense.\nThese  Sufis  believe  that  the  dead  have  the  power  to bring about harm and benefit. Hence, they direct various types of worship towards the dead, such as du\u2019a, tawakkul, sacrificial slaughter, and tawaf (circumambulation). They also claim that the dead are intermediaries between them and Allah \uf063 just as human kings have intermediaries between themselves and their subjects. Allah is far exalted above the mushrikin\u2019s claim. Likewise, they follow their tawaghit and shuyukh in their falsehood, and they blindly obey them in all statements and deeds.\nAll the Sufi tariqas in the world today share in these matters,  while  having  minor  differences  between  them. All the Sufi tariqas that we have known, heard of, or read about have fallen into shirk in one way or another.\nThe followers of the Ahmadi tariqah believe in hulul (panentheism) and ittihad (pantheism) \u2013 and Allah\u2019s refuge is sought \u2013 and they say that Allah \uf063 \u201cstays in everything that is still and moves in everything that moves\u201d! He is far exalted above what they say. Likewise, they venerate Ibn \u2018Arabi, al-Hallaj, and other imams of kufr and deviance.\nAs  for  the  Jariri  tariqah,  they  are  more  known  for grave-worship.  They  venerate  tombs,  perform  sacrificial slaughter for them, perform tawaf around them, and so on. This tariqah has a connection to the religion of the Rafidah. The one who authored the book of poetry titled \u201cBustan al-Mahabbah\u201d (The Garden of Love) \u2013 which they venerate and consider to be like a \u201cquran\u201d \u2013 is the dead Rafidi, an-Nimr al-Laythi, whose home was in Tanta.\nFrom among the rituals of worship practiced by the Sufis  in  Sinai  \u2013  like  Sufis  elsewhere  \u2013  is  what  they  call \u201cHadrah,\u201d which is their gathering together on the night \nA Sufi shirki lodge outside the territory of the Khilafah in Sinai \n\f", "schema:headline": "Just Terror Tactics: Part 3", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "7"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah8-And-Worship-Your-Lord-until-Death-Comes-to-You", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "Indeed, if Allah blesses one of His slaves, He makes for him his external the same as his internal and makes his statements to be in accordance with his actions, and he doesn\u2019t make him a munafiq in his belief or one whose actions contradict his  speech.\nThis is what Allah blessed the Islamic State with \u2013 due to His grace c \u2013 in many ways which can\u2019t be counted. From the main blessings is the purpose of its existence, and the reason for its formation \u2013 that is the establishment of the religion and ruling by the Shari\u2019ah.\nSo it opposed those who are misguided and who misguide others, from amongst the fractured and opposing  factions  and  the  parties  of  detriment,  those who filled the earth with their declarations and theories concerning their endeavor to establish the religion and their ambition to achieve that as soon as they have authority  and  take  power.  Then  it  became  apparent that their slogans were mere lies, and they broke their promises as soon as they achieved what they wanted, so they ruled by the legislations of the tawaghit, giving preference to the survival of their symbols and organi-\nzations as opposed to establishing the religion. Every time Allah opened for the Islamic State an area of land and they were empowered therein, its soldiers would hasten in establishing Allah\u2019s religion and ordering the people with good and forbidding them from evil, despite their certain knowledge that this matter would incite the kuffar against them and enrage the hearts of the munafiqin in opposition to them, however they sought through it the pleasure of the Lord of the creation.\nThe most soothing thing to the eyes of the muwahhid today is that he sees in every part of the Islamic State that the prayer is established and the zakat is collected, virtue is commanded and vice is forbidden, and that the hudud is carried out, despite the fact that the battle fronts are ignited on all sides.\nThe lions of Islam can be seen writing history, sacrificing  their  blood  and  their  lives,  as  they  confront the campaigns of the mushrikin on the outskirts of a city, while at the same time the adhan is called and the Muslims gather for prayer despite being only a street or two away from the ignited battle fronts. Likewise, \n4Foreword\n\fSo it was that the believers hoped to meet the caravan of Quraysh, so that they could take it easily without a fight and seize its spoils to empower them and hold them over for some time. But Allah c wanted \u2013 with His knowledge and wisdom \u2013 that the caravan should escape and that Quraysh should mobilize, determined to fight the Muslims with an army that exceeded three times the number of the Muslims. They hoped thereby to finish off the Muslims, who had begun to tarnish the standing of Quraysh, affecting them and their business dealings. Thus came to pass the Major Battle of Badr, about which Allah said, \u201cWhen Allah promised you one of the two groups, that it would be yours, and you wished that the unarmed one would be yours. But Allah intended to establish the truth by His words and to eliminate the disbelievers, so that He should establish the truth and abolish falsehood, even if the criminals disliked it\u201d (Al-Anfal 7-8).\nAlso,  Allah  c  made  the  kuffar  seem  few  in  the believers\u2019 eyes, so that they would be encouraged to fight them and not fear them. Likewise, He made the believers  seem  few  in  the  kuffar\u2019s  eyes,  thereby  luring them into fighting them. He c said, \u201cWhen He showed them to you, when you met, as few in your eyes, and He made you appear as few in their eyes, so that Allah might accomplish a matter already destined. And to Allah all matters are returned\u201d (Al-Anfal 44). Then, when the two sides met, the kuffar saw the Muslims as if they were double the number of kuffar. So the army of kufr was shaken, their morale declined, their strength waned, they lost hope of victory, and Allah empowered the believers with His support. He c said, \u201cAlready there has been for you a sign in the two armies which met \u2013 one fighting in the cause of Allah and another of disbelievers. They saw them as if twice their own number in their eyes. But Allah empowers with His support whom He wills. Indeed in that is a lesson for those with insight\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 13).\ngreat and much of it is unknown to us.\nIn the Battle of Ahzab, Allah c tested the believers with a hard and unexpected test, but it only increased them in having iman that the promise of Allah and His Messenger g, regarding the believers\u2019 victory and the disbelievers\u2019 defeat, would be realized.\nAllah c said, \u201cO you who believe, remember the favor of Allah upon you when armies came to attack you and We sent upon them a wind and armies (of angels),  which  you  did  not  see\u201d  (Al-Ahzab  9).  Ibn Kathir  said,  \u201cAllah c  is  referring  here  to  His  favor, bounty, and generosity to His believing slaves when \nHe repelled their enemies and defeated them in the year they gathered and rallied against them. That was the year of the Khandaq (Trench) in Shawwal of the fifth year after the hijrah\u2026 The mushrikin came and camped  east  of  Madinah,  near  Uhud,  and  a  group of them camped on the high ground of Madinah, as Allah  c  said,  \u2018When  they  came  at  you  from  above you and from below you\u2019 (Al-Ahzab 10). Allah\u2019s Messenger g went out with between seven-hundred and three-thousand Muslims, putting their backs to Sal\u2019 [a mountain at the market of Madinah] and their faces towards the enemy.\u201d This mobilization of the kuffar was a hard trial for the Muslims. Ibn Kathir continues, \u201cThe situation was difficult and harsh, and the condition was tight, as Allah c said, \u2018There the believers were tested and shaken with a severe shaking\u2019 (Al-Ahzab 11). They remained there, besieging the Prophet g and his companions for nearly a month.\u201d\nThen came the support of Allah c, after that hardship and adversity, in an amazing way that showed Allah\u2019s ability, power, might, wisdom, and His kindness to the believers. He c said, \u201cAllah repelled those who disbelieved,  in  their  rage,  not  having  obtained  any good. And sufficient was Allah for the believers in battle, and ever is Allah Powerful and Exalted in Might\u201d (Al-Ahzab 25). And Allah c empowered the believers with  victory  over  and  massacre  of  the  Jews  of  Bani Quraydhah, and then blessed the believers with many spoils,  which  He  caused  them  to  inherit  from  Bani Quraydhah.  He  c  said,  \u201cHe  brought  down  those who supported them among the People of the Book from their fortresses and cast terror into their hearts [so that] a party you killed, and you took captive a party. And He caused you to inherit their land and their homes and their properties and a land which you have not trodden. And ever is Allah, over all things, competent\u201d  (Al-Ahzab  26-27).\nIndeed, it is Allah\u2019s promise that He has fulfilled for His slaves after He tried and tested them, until the munafiqin left their ranks and the believers increased in solidarity and trust in that promise. So victory came to them from where they did not expect. We ask Allah to grant victory, honor, and consolidation to His slaves the mujahidin, and all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of  the creation.\n\f", "schema:headline": "And Worship Your Lord until Death Comes to You", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah7-What-They-Never-Told-Me", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of the creation, and may peace and blessings be upon the one who was sent with a sword as a mercy to mankind.\nAfter coming to Islam, I was given a pile of guides compiled for the new Muslim. These books and booklets explained the five pillars of Islam and the six pillars of iman, and also taught how to perform wudu and salah. At first, I thought this was quite a lot, as I had previously seen the lack of religious adherence by so-called \u201cMuslims\u201d \u2013 those whom I had thought to be Muslims \u2013 who didn\u2019t pray, possibly fasted during Ramadan, and whose extent of following the Shari\u2019ah was restricted to the avoidance of eating pork. After my iman started to root deeper and I gained a better understanding of what Islam really means, I started to wonder how these customary \u201cMuslims,\u201d who would neither pray nor fast, could even call themselves Muslims.\nWhen I asked about this problem, I received varying answers from both lay \u201cMuslims\u201d and supposedly knowledgeable \u201cMuslims.\u201d The responses were so different, I couldn\u2019t decide which one of them to follow.

This time, I couldn\u2019t let the matter rest, so I decided to start looking for an  answer  to  this  question  myself.  I  started  to  read books about \u2018aqidah. One of them mentioned something that I had never heard of before as a Muslim: the nullifiers of Islam. I was shocked! This was partly because I had never given thought to such a serious matter, and partly because nowhere else was I taught that, \u201cYes! In a blink of an eye, you can nullify your Islam and go from being a Muslim to being a murtadd kafir!\u201d\nKufr and riddah are two words that are taboo in the \u201cMuslim\u201d community of Finland. Few dare to utter them aloud and even fewer dare to accuse anyone of falling into them. But what is most dangerous is that most of them don\u2019t even know that there are ac-\nExclusive\n\fKnow, may Allah have mercy on you, that \u201cLa ilaha illallah\u201d is the supreme, most honorable, and most valuable  statement.  Whoever  holds  onto  it  shall  be safe and protected. The Messenger of Allah \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever says, \u2018La ilaha illallah,\u2019 and disbelieves in what  is  worshiped  besides  Allah,  his  property  and blood  shall  be  protected,  and  his  account  shall  be upon  Allah\u201d  (Reported  by  Muslim  from  Tariq  Ibn Ashyam). This hadith reveals that \u201cLa ilaha illallah\u201d is a word to be pronounced and that it has a meaning.Regarding this, people are divided into three categories. The first category consists of those who pronounced it and accomplished it in both meaning and application,  avoiding  its  nullifiers.  The  second  category is of those who pronounced it, outwardly acting according  to  it,  thereby  decorating  themselves  with its words, yet they inwardly succumbed to kufr and doubt.  The  third  category  is  of  those  who  spoke  it but acted against its meaning, openly falling into its nullifiers. They are \u201cthose whose effort is lost in the Dunya, while they think that they are doing well in work\u201d (Al-Kahf 104). The first category is safe, that of those of the true believers, while the second is of the munafiqin and the third is of the mushrikin.\n\u201cLa  ilaha  illallah\u201d  is  a  fortress.  But  they  erected against it the catapult of denial, casting the stones of ruin. So when the enemy entered, they took away its meaning and left its mere image. The hadith also says, \u201cIndeed, Allah does not look to your images and bodies, but rather, He looks to your hearts and deeds\u201d (Re-\nManifesting tawhid by commanding good and forbidding evil\nported by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah). They seized the meaning of \u201cLa ilaha illallah,\u201d such that all they had left was a movement of the tongue and the uttering of words. They speak of the fortress, but they are not protected thereby. Just as the mention of fire does not burn, the mention of water does not drown, the mention of bread does not satisfy one\u2019s hunger, and the mention of a sword does not cut. Likewise, the mention of the fortress does not protect. Words are the rind and the meaning is the core. Words are the shell and the meaning is the pearl. What then comes of a rind without a core or a shell without a pearl?\n\u201cLa ilaha illallah\u201d is to its meaning as the soul is to its body. The body is useless without the soul. Likewise,  this  statement  is  useless  without  its  meaning. The  people  of  merit  took  this  statement  with  both its image and its significance. They adorned their exteriors with its image \u2013 its words \u2013 and their inner selves with the meaning. As such, they were witnessed as preceding with truthfulness. \u201cAllah witnesses that there is no deity except Him, and so do the angels and those of knowledge, maintained in justice. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 18).\nThe people who equate things with Allah, i.e. those who  commit  shirk,  have  taken  this  image  without its meaning. They have adorned their exteriors with words  and  their  inner  selves  with  kufr,  believing  in what  neither  benefits  nor  causes  harm.  Their  hearts are dark and blackened.

But whether they are Muslims or merely claim to be Muslims, in both cases there is enough reason for the original inhabitants  of  the  land  from  among  the  Christians and Jews to hate them, and to endeavor to separate them from themselves, relegate them to the outskirts of the city, and avoid mixing with them and employing them in important positions of work. They prefer to leave them in this despicable condition so that they can be cheap servants for them who perform the kind of work that they themselves avoid, granting them in exchange for this humiliating condition the permission to remain in the country, as well as some wealth that barely keeps them alive and suffices their needs.Many of the residents of these suburbs accept these circumstances, which the tawaghit of the country and its native citizens conspired in in order that their situation remains as such, while others rebelled, in pursuit of a better life, equating with those who exclude them, and seeking fortune through the admiration of those who hate them. And so they did not find any avenue which would deliver them to that goal accept wealth, for it is the most important factor for measuring the value of people in that material society. Thus, the acquisition of wealth through any means possible became the goal, in pursuit of the attainment of deprived needs, and in aspiration of the fulfillment of endless desires.\nIn order to achieve this goal within the fastest time possible many of those pursue this worldly life, wandering  and  panting  behind  it,  motivated  by  the  attainment of a quick fortune, in most cases that being limited to the world of robbery and drug dealing.

He carried out a surprise attack on them with his light weapon and, after massacring several of them and exhausting his supply of ammunition, charged into their midst and detonated his explosive vest on them.

He detonated his explosive vehicle in their midst, killing 35 murtaddin and injuring nearly 45 others. Among them were some heads of kufr, including the murtadd Hisham Khalifah, a leader in Ahrar ash-Sham, the murtadd Khalid as-Sayyid, the head of the taghut higher judicial  council,  and  Muhammad  al-Faraj,  the  murtadd general deputy of the judicial council, both councils judging by other than what Allah revealed.\nAlgeria\nOn the 7th of Muharram, the soldiers of the Khilafah detonated an explosive device on a convoy belonging to the murtadd Algerian army yesterday near the city of Tamalus in Skikda towards the northeast of Algeria.\nOn the 28th of Muharram, the soldiers of the Khilafah assassinated a brigadier general in the murtadd Algerian police in the city of Qusantinah and took his weapon.\nKhurasan Wilayah\nOn the 11th of Muharram, our istishhadi brother \u2018Ali Jan \uf08a set out towards a gathering of Rafidi mushrikin in the area of Kartah Sakhi Ziyarat in the city of Kabul as they were engaged in their shirki rituals. He attacked them \nAftermath of the attack in Sha\u2019b on the Rafidah\nwith his assault rifle and hand grenades until he finished his ammunition, and then detonated his explosive vest in their midst, killing more than 14 of them, and injuring approximately  40  others.  An  Afghan  intelligence  force then arrived to protect the pagan shrine, and 30 minutes after the first attack, our istishhadi brother Thaqib al-Khurasani \uf08a attacked the intelligence personnel. He opened fire on them with his assault rifle and threw several hand grenades  before  detonating  his  explosive  vest  on  them, killing and injuring 70 murtaddin.\nOn  the  24th  of  Muharram,  our  brothers  Talhah al-Khurasani, \u2018Umar al-Khurasani, and \u2018Ubaydah al-Khurasani  \uf08d  carried  out  an  inghimasi  attack  on  a  training center belonging to the murtadd Pakistani police in the area of Saryab Road in the city of Quetta towards the west of Pakistan.

The soldiers of the Khilafah attacked government offices in the city and took control of a number of them, following which they kept advancing and took control of the neighborhoods of One Huzayran, Dumiz, \u2018Urubah, Nasr,  Majidiyyah,  Wasiti,  Tis\u2019in,  \u2018Adalah,  Mamdudah, and Gharnatah as a breakdown took place in the ranks of the murtaddin of the Peshmerga, the Rafidi Mobilization, and the security forces. At least 360 murtaddin were killed and a number of others were taken prisoner, including a lieutenant colonel in the Asayish security agency. Sources from inside the city reported that a number of Peshmerga officers fled with their families outside the city of Karkuk. Meanwhile,  the  soldiers  of  the  Khilafah  carried  out  an istishhadi operation with an explosive vehicle, striking a group of murtadd security forces near the provincial government  building.  During  the  course  of  the  attack,  the mujahidin captured a number of military vehicles as well as large quantities of ammo as ghanimah, and destroyed several other vehicles belonging to the murtaddin. In conjunction with the attack on the city, the soldiers of the Khilafah launched an attack on the region of Dibs north of Karkuk, with an istishhadi operation striking a Peshmerga reinforcement convoy and the mujahidin also cutting off the murtaddin\u2019s supply route between the region of Dibs and  the  city  of  Karkuk.  They  also  attacked  the  areas  of Albu Hamdan, Maktab Khalid, Daquq, Rashad, Sardak, Kabbah, and Bashir towards the south and southwest of Karkuk, as well as the area of Kraw towards the northeast of Hawijah. This operation was part of many to devastate the murtaddin and break their campaign against Ninawa Wilayah.

The soldiers of the Khilafah then stormed the murtadd barracks in the vicinity of the city, completely capturing them, and then continued their advance towards the city, entering its neighborhoods and attacking the Rafidi army\u2019s positions and centers. They succeeded in taking complete control of the city apart from the neighborhood of Karabilah. The neighborhood  of  Karabilah  saw  an  istishhadi  attack  on one of the locations where the remnants of the murtaddin were entrenched, and a second istishhadi attack was carried out targeting one of the Rafidi army barracks during the course of the assault. The operation resulted in more than 70 Rafidi soldiers being killed, in addition to a large number of their vehicles being destroyed. This operation came only two days after the soldiers of the Khilafah penetrated the city of Karkuk and was part of the operations to devastate the murtaddin and break their campaign against Ninawa  Wilayah.  The  mujahidin  thereafter  withdrew from Rutbah after executing their mission, and all praise is to Allah.\nRussia\nOn the 22nd of Muharram, two soldiers of the Khilafah \uf08c carried out an attack on a Russian military base in the city of Nizhny Novgorod, attacking the Crusaders with light weapons and hand grenades before the shahadah of the two brothers. They thereby exacted vengeance for the Muslims killed by the Russian Crusaders and their Rafidi and Nusayri allies in Qawqaz, Iraq, and Sham. \nSomalia\nOn the 25th of Muharram, the soldiers of the Khilafah carried out an attack on a number of police stations belonging to the murtadd Somali police in the city of Bosaso towards the east of Somalia and in the city of Yakhshed north of Mogadishu, and succeeded, by Allah\u2019s grace, in taking control of the town of Qandala located near the city of Bosaso.\nOn the 27th of Muharram, the soldiers of the Khilafah destroyed an armored vehicle belonging to African Union forces after targeting it with an explosive device in the area of Ilasha near Mogadishu. They also carried out two attacks with hand grenades, with the first attack targeting a government headquarters in the area of Ilasha and the second attack targeting a police station in the city of Bosaso towards the east of Somalia.\nAnbar Wilayah\nKenya\nOn the morning of the 22nd of Muharram, the soldiers of the Khilafah launched a wide scale attack from five axes on the city of Rutbah located near the artificial borders with Jordan towards the west of Anbar. During the course of the attack, they succeeded in taking control of most of the city\u2019s neighborhoods in just a matter of hours. The  operation  began  with  inghimasi  attacks  on  Rafidi \nOn the 26th of Muharram, a soldier of the Khilafah \uf08a stabbed one of the Crusader guards at the American embassy in the city of Nairobi in response to the Islamic State\u2019s call to target the citizens of nations participating in the Crusader coalition.\n44\nArticle\f45\n\f46\nArticle\f", "schema:headline": "Military and Covert Operations", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "41"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah11-Either-We-Exterminate-the-Mushrikin-or-Die-Trying", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "The Rafidah entered into the battle of Mosul parading their armored vehicles and heavy tanks in long convoys \u2013 one barely able to see where they end \u2013 and they promised their Crusader allies that they would end the battle in a matter of days.

We praise Him, seek His help, and ask for His forgiveness. We seek refuge with Allah from the evils of our souls and the evil consequences of our deeds. Whomsoever Allah guides,  none  can  misguide,  and  whomsoever  Allah misguides, none can guide. I testify that there is no god but Allah, alone and without partners, and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and messenger, who delivered the message, fulfilled the trust, admonished the  Ummah  and  left  it  upon  the  clear  path  whose night is like its day, and from which none strays except one who is ruined. \u201cO you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims [in submission to Him]\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 102). \u201cO mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from the two of them many men and women.

As for what follows:\nHistory  repeats  itself  and  the  logic  throughout the ages does not change. People change, actors are changed, tools evolve, but the stage of the events is constant and the story of the conflict is the same.\nTruth  wrestles  with  falsehood,  Islam  wages  war against disbelief, jahiliyyah and hypocrisy creep in, and  weak,  frail  individuals  hold  the  staff  from  its middle and ascribe themselves to their ummah, but give preference to their worldly life and wait for the silence of those shouting and for the end of the battle so that they may join the strong one, and board the ships of the dominant, and evil is what they do.\nThe pious men alone carry the banner in an era when  the  people  break  down,  and  they  raise  their foreheads in an era when the people are disgraced, and their ambitions soar through the air to the Knowing, \nSeeing One in emulation of the warner and bringer of glad tidings g. They are strangers whose faces are scorched  by  the  winds  of  solitude,  and  whose  bare feet bleed in deserts that are inflamed by the fire of enmity. Doors are shut before them, so they seek the door to the heavens and it is opened for them by the soul of the gardens, by which the souls are given life. They tasted the joy of iman, so none of them goes back out of resentment towards his religion, even if the whole world were to unite against him.\nO  my  ummah,  the  measure  has  overflown,  the matter  has  reached  a  critical  point,  the  oppressors have exceeded the limits, the rebellious transgressors have sniffed our earth, and wolves \u2013 nay, dogs! \u2013 have become  emboldened  against  us!\nAnd the people search for a solution in the mirage of the desert of the labyrinth, while the solution is in their hands\u2026 it is but waging jihad for the sake of Allah!\nThese are recommendations of the leaders of jihad who  went  ahead  of  us  on  this  blessed  path,  which I gathered with minor alterations, as a reminder for myself and my mujahid brothers, as an incitement to steadfastness, and as a call to patience upon the fundamentals and constants.\nO  mujahidin!  Indeed,  I  do  not  fear  for  you  the abundance of your enemy, nor the magnitude of their weaponry, nor the mobilization of the forces of evil and their gathering against you. Nor do I fear the desertion of your Muslim brothers in the various parts of the world, but I fear for you from your own selves. I  fear  that  weakness,  feebleness,  failure,  and  abundance of sins may afflict you. And there is a lesson and a reminder for you in what happened on the day of the Battle of Uhud. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cUntil [the time] when you lost courage and fell to disputing about the order [given by the Prophet] and disobeyed after He had shown you that which you love. Among you are those who desire this world, and among you are those who desire the Hereafter. Then He turned you back from  them  [defeated]  that  He  might  test  you\u201d  (Al \u2018Imran 152).\nIbn  Kathir  said,  \u201cTriumph  and  victory  were  for Islam at the beginning of the day, but when the disobedience of the archers took place and some of the fighting failed, the promise tied to the condition of steadfastness  and  obedience  was  delayed.\u201d\nIn this battle amazing events took place: The enemy  was  more  than  three  times  stronger  than  the Muslims.

Yet they still make the exception of their husband and their co-wife, assuming that eating their flesh is allowed and that they are immune on Yawm al-Qiyamah  to  account  and  inquisition.  And  rarely would you hear from those listening one who openly reprimands her, deters her, warns her, or reminds her. Instead, most of those listening enjoy it, their curiosity raised about the conduct and stories of these absent spouses.  In  his  book  Riyad  as-Salihin,  an-Nawawi mentioned the chapter, \u201cProhibition of Listening to Backbiting  and  the  Order  to  One Who  Hears  Forbidden Backbiting to Respond to It and Criticize Its Bearer; and If He Is Unable or His Words Are Not Accepted, Then He Should Leave that Gathering If Possible.\u201d\nAnd yet, if some of them were to only limit themselves to listening! Some women help one another and support  each  other  in  this  wrongdoing.  When  one woman complains against her husband, some of her friends react with incitement and provocation. Worse still, some women even guide their sister to the court and explain the procedure for divorce. They beautify to  her  the  termination  of  her  relationship  with  her husband, hoping to marry her off to one of their relatives or to one of their husband\u2019s relatives \u2013 not doing  anything  for  her  out  of  love  or  in  an  endeavor to fix her problem \u2013 as if they have never read what Abu Dawud reported from Abu Hurayrah, that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever embitters a women against her husband, or a slave against his owner, is not from us.\u201d\nThe  same  applies  regarding  one\u2019s  co-wife.  Many women do not refrain from speaking ill of their cowives. Instead, among them is she who would go as far as to insult her co-wife and curse her in her absence due to excessive jealousy. This happens during a meeting of women or in the presence of the husband, who often has no clue as to what he can do! Should he fight off the hostility of this sharp-tongued woman against himself or against his absent wife? Indeed, Allah\u2019s help must be sought!\nEvery Muslim woman should remember that any disparagement of her Muslim brother or sister, even with  a  mere  gesture,  is  prohibited  slander,  which  is \none of the greatest sins. It was reported that \u2018Aishah i said, \u201cO Messenger of Allah, Safiyyah is a woman\u201d and she gestured with her hand to mean that she is short. He said, \u2018You have said a word that, if ever mixed with it, would alter seawater\u201d (Narrated by Abu Dawud).\nThis was Umm al-Muminin who jokingly gestured with her hand \u2012 instead of speaking with her tongue \u2012 her disparagement of her co-wife Safiyyah i. And yet, he \uf067 warned her against her enormous act, clarifying that if this word, which none would pay attention to, were to be mixed with the water of the sea, it would alter its qualities. Further, it suffices us that he \uf067 said, \u201cThe slave says a word that displeases Allah, not giving any attention to it, until he drops with it into  Jahannam\u201d  (Narrated  by  al-Bukhari  from  Abu Hurayrah).\nThe Intelligent Person Does Not Expose the Secrets \nof His Home\nEven worse than this woman who wrongs herself is finding an otherwise intelligent man speaking about the secrets of his home to others. He exposes the secrets of his relationship with his wife, as if to remove her veil in front of other men. Indeed, this is evidence of a lack of manliness. Only one who makes a fool of himself does such a thing. Such speech should only be said to the qadi, the mufti, or a counselor who is trusted with regards to his religion and morals, and who  safeguards  the  secrets  of  those  of  his  brothers who speak to him.\nNoble  are  the  morals  of  that  tabi\u2019i  who  wanted to  divorce  his  wife,  so  he  was  asked,  \u201cWhy  do  you want to divorce her?\u201d He said: \u201cI do not speak ill of my wife\u201d. After he had divorced her, some honorable men asked him, \u201cWhy did you divorce your wife?\u201d He  said,  \u201cI  am  not  one  of  those  who  speaks  about an ajnabiyyah woman,\u201d i.e. a woman who is neither directly  related  nor  married  to  him.\nSpouses who speak about each other should know that  every  secret  of  their  home  that  is  revealed  and every ill-spoken word is akin to tears in their clothes. The more the number of holes and the larger the holes are, the more the fabric of matrimony will inevitably decay,  and  no  amount  of  patchwork  will  help  after that.\nJust as homes have a sacredness to them, they also bear  secrets  that  no  muwahhid  and  believer  should ever  expose  to  others,  even  to  his  closest  relatives. \n\f", "schema:headline": "Disavowal of the Mushrikin in the Lives of the Prophet and the Sahabah", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "25"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah2-Glad-Tidings-of-Imminent-Victory-to-the-Patient", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "2", "schema:articleBody": "Allah \uf063 created His slaves and made tribulation something constant for them, so that the pure become distinct from  the  corrupt,  and  that  those  who  perish  may  perish upon clear proof and that those who live may live upon clear proof. Thus, there will be no consolidation without trial, no victory without hardship, and no ease without difficulty.The path to Allah \uf062 and what He prepared for the believers therein of immense reward is a costly path, and these costs  cannot  be  expended  except  by  true  believers,  those whose hearts are attached to Allah alone, who are steadfast upon  the  methodology  of  the  Prophet  \uf067  and  his  noble companions. These \u2013 the true believers \u2013 are not confused by famous men and popular names. They seek the truth and recognize its people. And the people of truth are not those whose reputation in \u201cjihad\u201d circulated for decades, only to distance  themselves  therefrom,  to  deteriorate  and  regress, eventually becoming people who desert jihad and deny it. Nor are they those who spent their lives reading and writing about jihad, but when the herald called, \u201cThe Islamic State has been established, so come and follow up your knowledge with action,\u201d they turned in arrogance, as if they were hard of hearing.\nDescribing the path to the gardens of eternity, Ibnul-Qayyim \uf072 said, \u201cHow far are you from the path? It is the path upon  which  Adam  became  exhausted,  upon  which  Nuh \ncried [in prayer], upon which Ibrahim was cast into the fire, upon which Isma\u2019il was laid down for slaughter, upon which Yusuf was sold for a meager price and spent years in prison, upon which Zakariyya was sawed in half, upon which Yahya was butchered, upon which Ayyub faced harsh illness, upon which Dawud wept greatly [in fear of Allah], upon which \u2018Isa walked with wild beasts, and upon which Muhammad \uf067 faced poverty and all kinds of abuse\u201d (Al-Fawaid).\nSo if this was the condition of the Prophets \uf070, among whom were those of utmost determination, who met what they met for the sake of Allah \uf062, had patience, and were steadfast despite the great harm they endured due to their da\u2019wah to tawhid, never slackening or becoming weak, then what about those who are lesser than them? Are they not tried so that they might become pure? Are they not tested so that they might become sincere? Ash-Shafi\u2019i \uf072 was asked, \u201cWhich is best for a man, to be granted consolidation or to be tested?\u201d He said, \u201cHe will not be granted consolidation until he is tested\u201d (Al-Fawaid).\nIndeed, one who does not have a scorching beginning will not have a shining end. So there is no consolidation until the trials are intensified and the constraints are tightened, as Jannah is only promised to the truthful men and women. Therein they shall gaze upon Allah\u2019s face, which is the highest of blessings and the dearest of hopes. Could that be at-\nArticle\fJannah, the precious commodity of Allah, is the most blissful place and the ultimate aspiration, to which the believers  race  and  for  which  competitors  should  compete. Minds are unable to fathom its blessed essence. The eloquent orator is unable to describe it with words. Yet it is encircled by thorns, not roses, as the blood and severed  limbs  of  those  who  purchase  it  bear  witness,  and willingly sacrificing oneself is the highest form of generosity. \u201cBy Allah, it is not something cheap over which the morally bankrupt could haggle. Nor is it something unsought, such that the destitute could purchase it on credit. It has been presented in the market for whoever wishes to acquire it. But its Lord was not content to put a  price  on  it  other  than  the  expenditure  of  souls.  The losers  procrastinate,  while  those  who  possess  true  love stand, waiting to see which of their souls is suitable to be the payment\u201d (Ibnul-Qayyim: Zad al-Ma\u2019ad).\nIn  His  Book,  Allah  \uf062  says  something  great,  and blessed are those who read it or hear it and reflect over it  and  consider  its  meaning,  that,  \u201cIf  some  wound  afflicts you, then [know that] a similar wound has already afflicted  the  enemy.  Such  are  days  [of  war],  which  we alternate  between  the  people,  so  that  Allah  shall  make known those who believe and shall take from amongst them shuhada; and Allah does not like the tyrants. And so that Allah shall test those who believe and shall crush the disbelievers. Or did you think that you would enter Jannah, while Allah has yet to have made known those of you who waged jihad and those who were patient?\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 140-142). It is the perfect, divine management of affairs, a wound for a wound, a state for a state, and the believers, some of them are shuhada, and all of them are tested in order to be distinguished, and thus the pure rise above the foul. As for Jannah, it is the reward for those who pass the test and have patience during the trials, remaining steadfast upon hardship, neither panicking nor becoming resentful, never implying by their actions that, \u201cAllah and His Messenger promised us nothing but delusion\u201d (Al-Ahzab 12). How far the sick-hearted are from ever reaching and enjoying the gardens of their Lord!\nThe muwahhidah must not assume that she is exempt from such tests and trials. Rather, the woman and the man \u2013 regarding this \u2013 are similar. She could play a major role in keeping her husband and children steadfast. Such was the case of Khadijah and Asma, and of Sumayyah and al-Khansa, as well as many others whose virtues are too numerous to mention here. As for Khadijah, she is the Mother of the Believers and the one whose heart was the first to throb with iman in the prophetic message. She was one of those by whom Allah firmly established this  religion  through  her  support  of  her  husband,  the Final Messenger, Muhammad \uf067.\n\u2018Aishah  \uf069  narrated  that  the  Prophet  \uf067,  after  first receiving revelation at Hira Cave, became alarmed and went to his wife, Khadijah, telling her what happened, saying, \u201cI have become worried for myself.\u201d So Khadijah said to him, \u201cDo nothing, but rejoice! For by Allah, He will never disgrace you. By Allah, you keep ties of kinship, you speak the truth, you bear burdens for orphans and widows, you gain virtue by helping the destitute, you are \nhospitable to guests, and you help people through their afflictions\u201d  (Reported  by  al-Bukhari  and  Muslim).  So when the Mother of the Believers Khadijah \uf069 heard the astounding news from her husband, she did not despair or become terrified. She did not grab onto her husband for fear of the days to come. And she did not dishearten him, but rather emboldened him. On this, an-Nawawi said,  \u201cScholars  have  said  that  these  words  of  Khadijah \uf069  are  the  greatest  evidence  and  most  profound  proof of the merit of Khadijah, the excellence of her counsel, the strength of her soul, the firmness of her heart, and the magnitude of her comprehension. And Allah knows best\u201d (Sharh Sahih Muslim).\nDays passed and the da\u2019wah spread, as did the oppression of the tawaghit of Quraysh against the muwahhidin. They besieged them in the mountain pass belonging to Abu Talib and banned them from food and water. But the Mother of the Believers was steadfast alongside her husband \uf067. She was patient and perseverant, while the afflictions of hunger and thirst hit her as it hit the rest of the people with them. She was who she was, a person of great heritage and lineage, and of wealth and esteem. She stayed there in the pass of Abu Talib for two years, hurt by starvation and fatigue, until she died in her state of patience, firmly upon her religion, while her husband was pleased with her; may Allah be pleased with her.\nAs for Sumayyah, Bint Khayyat, the mother of \u2018Ammar  Ibn Yasir,  then  she  was  the  seventh  person  to  accept Islam and the first person to attain shahadah, thus quenching  the  tree  of  tawhid  with  her  blood.  Yes,  O Muslimah, the first blood to be shed for the cause of \u201cla ilaha illallah\u201d was the blood of a woman. Sumayyah, her husband, and her son were mawali (freed slaves) of the Makhzum  clan  of  Quraysh.  And  when  they  embraced Islam, they were met with all kinds of torture. Jabir \uf068 narrated  that  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  \uf067  passed  by  \u2018Ammar and his family while they were being tortured, so he said, \u201cGlad tidings, O family of \u2018Ammar, O family of Yasir, for verily your destination is Jannah\u201d (Reported by ad-Diya and  al-Hakim).\nSumayyah  \uf069  was  not  tortured  except  for  the  sake of Allah, in order to push her to leave her religion, the path of the Prophet \uf067, who did not bring wealth, gold, or silver, but only a \u201cnew\u201d religion, not followed by the forefathers of the Arab pagans. He gave them a word, to bear witness to and abide by, so that Jannah would be theirs.  And  despite  the  severe  torture,  and  despite  Sumayyah being a weak, oppressed woman, she remained firm and did not abandon faith or go back on what she believed and that by which she worshiped her Lord. Ibn Ishaq said, \u201cSome men from the family of \u2018Ammar Ibn Yasir  told  me  that  Sumayyah,  the  mother  of  \u2018Ammar, was tortured by the family of al-Mughirah [Ibn \u2018Abdillah al-Makhzumi] due to her Islam, and she refused to reject Islam until they killed her\u201d (As-Sirah). So her end was that of shahadah, after she was patient and steadfast, when the enemy of Allah \u2013 Abu Jahl (Ibn Hisham Ibn al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi) \u2013 pierced her with a spear, killing her.\nAs  for  Asma,  she  was  the  daughter  of  Abu  Bakr \n\f", "schema:headline": "Glad Tidings of Imminent Victory to the Patient", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "25"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5-Traits-of-the-Evil-Scholars", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "5", "schema:articleBody": "In  a  previous  article  titled  \u201cThe  Wicked  Scholars  Are Cursed,\u201d1 we clarified the correct meaning of \u201cscholars\u201d and mentioned the most important traits by which they became imams in the religion. It is clear by the shar\u2019i texts that the \u201cscholars\u201d of evil and deviance can never be counted among the scholars no matter how much they memorize and pen and no matter how famous they become. Rather, they are more similar to the Jews, who had knowledge, but concealed what they knew, did not act by it, and even called others to deviance. And because of the numerous \u201cscholars\u201d of evil in our era who have persisted in calling to misguidance, it is necessary to mention their ugly traits until the people are heedful of their danger.\nConcealing the Truth\nIndeed, among the purposes of knowledge is to convey it and make it clear to the people, as their guidance and interests  are  linked  to  it.  By  contrast,  concealing  it  and  not manifesting it are from the greatest of forbidden matters and severest of destructive sins. Thus, Allah has taken a covenant \n1   See Rumiyah, issue 1.\n26Article\nfrom every individual whom He gave knowledge, ordering that he convey it and not conceal what people need from it. Allah \uf063 said, \u201c[Mention], when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture, [saying], \u2018You must make it clear to the people and not conceal it.\u2019 But they threw it away behind their backs and exchanged it for a small price. And wretched is that which they purchased\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 187).As such, the evil \u201cscholar\u201d is a traitor to Allah\u2019s religion, a denier of the blessing of knowledge, and a cause for the people\u2019s deviance. Thus, Allah decreed that he be cursed and placed the people\u2019s curse upon him, due to his endeavor to cheat mankind by concealing the truth from them. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cIndeed, those who conceal what We sent down of clear proofs and guidance after We made it clear for the people in the Scripture \u2013 those are cursed by Allah and cursed by those who curse\u201d (Al-Baqarah 159).\nIndeed, the greatest matter which the evil \u201cscholars\u201d have concealed from the people is the condition of the tawaghit and the ruling of Allah on them, as Allah has commanded us to abandon the tawaghit and disbelieve in them, and has made this from the basis of tawhid and iman. However, when the  people  saw  their  prominent  \u201cscholars\u201d  compromising with the taghut rulers and being silent about their shirk and \nArticle\fThe river island from which it is said the Murabitin set forth \nsake of da\u2019wah. However, the Shaykh of Kadalah advised him to stay in a famous school near the Senegal River. Ibn Khaldun said, \u201cThey isolated themselves from the people at a hill near a river basin, one which is shallow in the summer and abundant in the winter, causing the appearance of various islands. They entered the forests on the islands and secluded themselves for worship\u201d (Tarikh Ibn Khaldun).\nFrom Da\u2019wah to Jihad\nAllah  willed  that  this  caller  to  Islam  would  be  a  good seed from which an Islamic emirate would grow. Ibn Khaldun said, \u201cAll those who had a grain\u2019s weight of good in their hearts began speaking about them. People began coming to them and entering into their religion and their forest home. Once their number reached a thousand men, their shaykh, \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin, said to them, \u2018A thousand will not be defeated due to small numbers, and establishing the truth, calling to it, and holding everyone to account for it has become obligatory on each of us. So let us go forth for this cause.\u2019 They then went out and killed whoever opposed them from the Lamtunah and Kadalah tribes.\u201d Ibn Yasin thus went forth as a mujahid for Allah\u2019s cause, fighting against the apostate tribes forcefully resisting the Shari\u2019ah.\nIbnul-Athir related this, saying, \u201cIbn Yasin then said to those who obeyed him, \u2018It is obligatory upon you to fight those who opposed the truth, denied the Shari\u2019ah of Islam, and prepared to fight you. So raise for yourselves a banner, and put forward an amir to lead you.\u2019\u201d And with that small believing group, the Murabitin subdued the desert to the rule of Allah \uf063. As-Salawi said, \u201cHe began raiding the different tribes until he conquered all of the lands of the Sahara and crushed its tribes\u2026 His authority became known in all of the lands of the Sahara and, from those that neighbored it, of the Sudan, the Kabyle, the Masmuda, and the rest of the Maghrib, and [the news spread] that there arose a man in Kadalah, calling to Allah \uf063 and to the straight path, and ruling by what Allah had revealed, and that he was humble \nand  had  zuhd  towards  the  Dunya.  His  reputation  soared throughout the lands, and his impression made its way into the people\u2019s hearts until they loved him.\u201d Just as he sought to please Allah by displeasing the people at the beginning of his mission, Allah caused the people to be pleased with him thereafter. They loved him and entered under his obedience.\nRuling by the Shari\u2019ah\nWhen  the  Shaykh  of  Kadalah  passed  away,  Ibn  Yasin presented the leader of the Lamtunah tribe to take over as the military leader. As-Salawi said, \u201c\u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin gathered  the  heads  of  the  Sanhaja  tribes  and  appointed Yahya Ibn \u2018Umar al-Lamtuni over them, while \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin was the amir\u2026 Yahya Ibn \u2018Umar was tasked with managing the affairs of war, while \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin oversaw affairs pertaining to religion, ruling by the Shari\u2019ah, and collecting zakah and jizyah.\u201d\nThe Murabitin continued, behind their new military amir and under the direction of their faqih, \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin, to renew the religion for the people.\nIn the year 446AH, as al-Bakri mentions, Ibn Yasin raided Aoudaghost (in southern Mauritania today), which was the seat of the King of Ghana before he entered into Islam. Al-Bakri said, \u201c\u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin killed a man there, who was from the mixed Arabs of Kairouan and who was known for  piety,  righteousness,  Quran  recitation,  and  performing Hajj, and his name was Zabaqirah. The reason the Murabitin attacked them was because these mixed Arabs backed the authority and rule of the [pagan] leader of Ghana\u201d (Al-Masalik wal-Mamalik).\nIn  the  year  447AH,  the  Murabitin  entered  Sijilmasa (in southern Morocco today), and stopped all wrongdoing therein. As-Salawi said, \u201c[\u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin] changed whatever vices he found therein. He destroyed flutes and musical instruments. He burned taverns in which wines were sold. He annulled taxes and toppled the taxing offices. He effaced whatever the Book and the Sunnah obligated to be effaced. \n\f", "schema:headline": "Traits of the Evil Scholars", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "25"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq3", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3-Towards-the-Major-Malhamah-of-Dabiq", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "3", "schema:articleBody": "During the Battle of Ahzab, the believers were afflicted by the sick-hearted and the scaremongers in Madinah, the people\u2019s eyes shifted in fear and their hearts reached their throats, and various assumptions were made about Allah. He \uf063  said,  \u201cAnd  you  assumed  about  Allah  [various]  assumptions\u201d (Al-Ahzab 10). At-Tabari and Ibn Abi Hatim reported  that  al-Hasan  al-Basri  \uf072  commented  on  this verse,  saying,  \u201cThe  munafiqin  thought  that  Muhammad and his companions would be eradicated, and the believers had conviction that what Allah had promised them was true \u2013 that He would make Islam overpower all religions even if the mushrikin despised such.\u201d The munafiqin and the sick-hearted then said, \u201cAllah and His Messenger did not promise us except delusion\u201d (Al-Ahzab 12). At-Tabari and Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Qatadah \uf072 commented on this verse, saying, \u201cSome of the munafiqin said, \u2018Muhammad used to promise us that we would conquer Persia and Rome, but we\u2019ve been besieged here and now none of us is able to go out to relieve his bowels. Allah and His Messenger did not promise us except delusion.\u2019\u201d\nThen \u2013 in the midst of harsh war and severe affliction \u2013 the believers realized that Allah\u2019s support was near. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cWhen the believers saw the [war] parties, they said, \u2018This is what Allah and His Messenger had promised us, \nand Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth.\u2019 And it increased them only in faith and submission\u201d (Al-Ahzab 22). At-Tabari reported that Ibn \u2018Abbas \uf06b commented on this verse, saying, \u201cAllah had said to them in Surat al-Baqarah, \u2018Do you think that you will enter Jannah while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken, until [their] messenger and those who believed with him said, \u2018When is the support of Allah?\u2019 Indeed, the support of Allah is near\u2019 (Al-Baqarah 214). So when calamity befell them as they were in the trench performing ribat against the war parties, the believers applied the verse to their situation, and it did not increase them except in faith and submission.\u201d\nThus, the believers, in their trenches, remember the ayat of Allah \uf065 and the ahadith of the Messenger \uf067, interpret what they contain of news and signs, and apply them to their tribulations. Hardships and calamities do not distance them from contemplating the ayat of Allah and the wisdom of the Messenger \uf067. Rather, the hardships and calamities increase the believers \u2013 during their effort and battle \u2013 in patience against tribulation, contentment with Allah\u2019s decree, and certainty of the actualization of what Allah and His Messenger \uf067 have promised them, whereas the mu-\n24Article\nArticle\fScholars of the tawaghit\nto not ask about the isnad, but when the fitnah arose, they would say, \u2018Name your men for us!\u2019 So they would take hadith from people of Sunnah and would not take hadith from people of bid\u2019ah.\u201d\nAn example of this is Shababah Ibn Sawwar al-Fazari (d. 206AH). When he adopted some of the bid\u2019ah of irja, Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal \uf072 abandoned taking knowledge from him and said, \u201cI did not write from him due to his irja\u201d (Al-Mizzi: Tahdhib al-Kamal).4\nThis indicates that there were those amongst the people of bid\u2019ah who bore knowledge, preserved it, and excelled in many fields thereof, yet despite so, the imams of the Sunnah were not deceived by them. Rather, the imams avoided the mubtadi\u2019ah, as such knowledge was not a commendation for  them,  but  a  proof  against  them.  Knowledge  necessitates fear of Allah and good deeds, as Ibrahim an-Nakha\u2019i \uf072 said, \u201cWhenever we wanted to take knowledge from a shaykh, we would ask him about his food, drink, and where he would spend his time. If he was upright, we would take from him. Otherwise, we would not go to him\u201d (Ibn \u2018Adiyy: Al-Kamil fi Du\u2019afa ar-Rijal).\nRather, the Salaf would not shy away from mentioning, by name, those who made mistakes when narrating, wheth-\n4   Though Shababah al-Fazari was involved in the bid\u2019ah of irja and even called to it, he did not hold the extreme views of later Murji\u2019ah. He  is  even  quoted  as  saying,  \u201cMy  opinion  and  that  of  Abun-Nadr Hashim Ibn al-Qasim and a group of the fuqaha is that Bishr al-Marisi is a kafir. If he does not repent, his neck should be struck\u201d (Al-Lalikai: Sharh as-Sunnah). On top of this, he was a truthful and trustworthy narrator of hadith, having narrations in both Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. Imam Ahmad abandoned him as a disciplinary measure for Shababah and a precautionary measure for himself, as a person\u2019s bid\u2019ah could possibly emerge in conversation and thereafter settle in the heart forever. Finally, it is reported from Abu Zur\u2019ah that Shababah repented from irja (Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi: Tarikh Baghdad), and Allah knows best.\ner due to poor memory or imprecision, even if they were people of virtue and uprightness, and this was in order to warn people of their mistakes. This is not prohibited ghibah (backbiting); it is obligatory, sincere advice. This is so that these mistakes are not wrongly attributed to the Shari\u2019ah. Otherwise, people might assume the mistakes are from the religion and thus follow them. As a result, Islamic history bore witness to the emergence of a magnificent science called \u201cal-Jarh wat-Ta\u2019dil,\u201d5 which was one of the greatest sources of pride for the Ummah, and through it, the Sunnah was preserved by distinguishing the authentic reports from the weak ones.\nAl-Jarh wat-Ta\u2019dil is one of the sciences of hadith. In it, the conditions of narrators \u2013 those who transmit knowledge \u2013 are researched in regards to their uprightness, precision, truthfulness, and trustworthiness. Thus, the scholars of this field would mention the narrator based on what was known of him being weak, being deceptive, making mistakes, or telling lies. These scholars even dedicated compilations to such  \u201cmajruhin\u201d  (those  with  whom  faults  were  found). Al-Bukhari  and  Abu  Ja\u2019far  al-\u2018Uqayli  (d.  322AH)  compiled books they entitled \u201cAd-Du\u2019afa,\u201d meaning \u201cthe weak ones.\u201d  An-Nasai  (d.  303AH),  ad-Daraqutni  (d.  385AH), and Ibnul-Jawzi (d. 597AH) compiled books they entitled \u201cAd-Du\u2019afa  wal-Matrukun,\u201d  meaning  \u201cthe  weak  and  the abandoned.\u201d Ibn \u2018Adiyy al-Jurjani (d. 365AH) compiled his book \u201cAl-Kamil fi Du\u2019afa ar-Rijal,\u201d meaning \u201cthe complete collection  of  weak  men.\u201d  Other  scholars  likewise  wrote many famous and important compilations in this field.\nIn this regards, \u2018Abdullah Ibn \u2018Ahmad Ibn Hanbal \uf074 said, \u201cAbu Turab an-Nakhshabi came to my father as my father was saying, \u2018So-and-so is weak.

How then when the Shari\u2019ah is full of evidences about women having to \n40Article\nremain  in  their  homes  and  to  abstain  from  leaving unnecessarily\u201d  (At-Tafsir).\nIbn Kathir \uf072 said, \u201cThese are etiquettes which Allah \uf063 ordered the wives of the Prophet \uf067 to practice, and the women of the Ummah have to follow them therein\u201d (At-Tafsir).\nThe Sunnah is full of ahadith that indicate the permissibility  of  a  woman  leaving  her  home  to  seek  a fatwa, to provide water and medical treatment on the battleground to the wounded, or to visit her friends \nIndeed,  if  such  was  the  commandment  of  Allah \uf062 to the wives of the Prophet \u2013 the best of women, with the purest hearts, and most wary of what Allah has forbidden \u2013 then how about women who are less than them in status?\nWe cannot forbid what Allah \uf063 permitted, we seek refuge from doing so. Allah \uf063 is kind and merciful to His slaves and did not forbid a woman from leaving her  home  absolutely.  Rather,  He  only  made  staying home the default rule. As for her leaving home, then such is based upon need. This need is evaluated by the woman  after  her  husband,  father,  or  guardian.

The  hudud  of  Allah are  carried  out  on those  deserving  of them,  and  the  circumstances  did  not stop the call to good, and  ordering  it  and forbidding  evil.  This is how Islam is established  in  its  totality  as  Allah  c  ordered.\nThe murtaddin\u2019s claims that they would rule by the Shari\u2019ah were mere lies\nSo the fighter on the frontlines remains firm in his place only to defend the land that is governed by Allah\u2019s shari\u2019ah from the mushrikin, and he knows with certainty  that  his  victory  over  his  enemy  is  not  due to the strength of his arms, nor to the accuracy of his weapon or the extent of his equipment. Rather it is the sheer grace of Allah upon him. And the more he is certain that the religion is being established as Allah has willed, the more he increases in certainty of Allah\u2019s victory for him over his enemy. And so he establishes the religion on the axis that the imam designated him with, by waging jihad against the mushrikin and defending the Muslim lands.\nHis brothers behind him are a company to which he falls back and a means of support. They protect the Muslims\u2019 honor and wealth, and nothing keeps them away from the battle fronts and the outposts of ribat except their obedience to those in authority over them and that which they fulfill of the responsibility placed on their shoulders \u2013 the responsibility of establishing the religion, whose rites would not be honored, whose hudud  would  not  be  preserved,  and  whose  rulings would not be implemented without them. So if they are called to mobilize, they mobilize, if their support is sought, they support, and if they are ordered, they obey.\nThis is how the situation continues to proceed in every part of Dar al-Islam. The soldiers of the Islamic State establish the religion therein as long as the blessing of empowerment continues, so that if Allah afflicts them through their enemy and they are forced to fall \nback and regroup with the main company \u2013 with the permission of their leaders \u2013 after sacrificing greatly in repelling the mushrikin from it, they become free of blame before Allah, and go back to exerting every effort in order to regain control over the territory they withdrew  from  and  establish  the  Shari\u2019ah  therein. Through that, the truthfulness of their call and their loyalty  to  their  pledge  is  confirmed,  such  that  they please their Lord and demonstrate the correctness of their  manhaj.\nAl-Bukhari reports from Anas that the Prophet g said, \u201cIf the Hour is established and in the hand of one of you is a date palm seedling and he is able to finish planting it, then he should plant it\u201d (Al-Adab al-Mufrad).\nTherefore, O soldiers of Islam and defenders of the Shari\u2019ah,  let  not  one  of  you  disdain  any  manner  of good deed, and let him not become incompetent in establishing any rite from the rites of Islam that he is capable of establishing, or calling to any of the recommended deeds, even if he is occupied with repelling the enemy, defending the lands, or guarding an outpost.\nAnd  beware  of  delaying  the  establishment  of  the religion in its entirety after Allah has established you in the land even for a day or part of a day. And beware of undoing any of the religion\u2019s rites and rulings in the territory you control for so much as a day or part of a day, for you will anger your Lord and assist your enemy against yourselves. Allah says, \u201cSo whoever does an atom\u2019s weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom\u2019s weight of evil will see it\u201d (Az-Zalzalah 7-8).\n\f", "schema:headline": "Contents", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "1"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah11", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq2", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah11-Important-Advice-for-the-Mujahidin:-Part-1", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "6ARTICLE\nARTICLE\fMy beloved sisters with whom I am on a journey to Allah, let us purify our intentions and rectify our deeds, as it seems that ahead of us await times of intense trials and extreme hardships, and times of severe battles between iman and kufr, after which will be ease inshaallah, as Allah \uf063 has promised us in His statement, \u201cFor verily along with hardship is relief.

Are our  souls  ready  to  make  sacrifices  for  the  sake  of Allah?  Are  our  hearts  empty  of  everything  except iman? Are we able to continue upon this path? Are we able to remain firm and steadfast and say as the Sahabah  \uf073  said  after  the  Battle  of  Uhud:  \u201cThose unto whom the people said, \u2018Verily the people have gathered  against  you.

It was due to their sincerity towards Allah and His Messenger. Was there anything left that they did not give up in order to seek the pleasure of Allah? There were no thorny paths that they could have treaded for the sake of Allah except that they treaded them willingly. There was no better way of showing their loyalty to Allah and His Messenger than cutting the heads of their mushrik relatives and so they did it. Their claim of loving Allah and His Messenger more than  anything  else  was  truly  illustrated  through their  iman,  their  taqwa,  their  sacrifices,  and  their ambitions. It was demonstrated by what their concerns were. And their yearning to Allah made it clear that they desired the Hereafter only. May Allah \uf063 be pleased with them all and grant us of strength, iman, and taqwa the like of what they were blessed with so that we can attain the likes of the rewards they  attained.\nMy beloved sisters, our roles and responsibilities have not come to an end. Rather, they have increased and have become of greater importance. It is time to  reform  ourselves,  to  wake  up  from  the  slumber of heedlessness to the reality of our objectives. It is \ntime to examine our duties and roles, and prioritize our concerns for the Hereafter, not the Dunya. We Muslim women are required to fulfill our duties attentively, and being negligent of them will only lead to our own destruction. Our mission is greater than we can imagine. Allah has honored us by choosing us to be the wives, sisters, and mothers of the mujahidin, so does it befit us to be busied by the lowly materialistic life as many of us have unfortunately become? The time to prepare ourselves is limited, so we must dust off the dirt of laziness and break the shackles of the Dunya. Did we not already leave the best that the world could offer us a long time ago? Did we not leave the most beloved ones to us behind when we took our first steps on our hijrah? So why it is that after having purified our hearts of the Dunya some  of  us  are  caught  up  in  the  traps  of  shaytan, with our hearts being contaminated and becoming attached to the Dunya once more by making foods, drinks, gossip, slander, idle speech, and materialistic objects our main concern? How sad is it that we are witnessing sisters chasing after the Dunya here instead of making their priority the support of their mujahid husbands and the raising of their children to emulate the likes of Khalid Ibn Walid and \u2018Abdullah Ibn az-Zubayr.\nAllah  \uf063  says  \u201cYou  are  the  best  nation  brought forth  for  the  people.  You  enjoin  right  and  forbid wrong, and you believe in Allah\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 110). Yet, how many sisters have returned to Dar al-Harb after refusing to remarry for the sake of Allah due to their extreme love of their husband who had attained  shahadah  inshaallah,  even  though  on  the Day of Judgment everyone\u2019s cry will be \u201cMyself, myself,\u201d and neither will a woman be concerned about her husband, nor will a man be concerned about his wife.  Why  are  we  allowing  our  desires  to  control our actions? Do we not contemplate on the ayah in which Allah \uf063 says, \u201cHave you seen him who takes his own desires as his god?\u201d (Al-Jathiyah 23). How many of us here without maharim are not obeying those who\u2019ve been designated to be responsible over us, whereas Allah commands us to do so, saying, \u201cO you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those of you who are in authority\u201d (An-Nisa 59).\nAnd how many of us are making life difficult for our  husbands  because  they  intend  to  practice  the sunnah of polygamy in which there are many benefits for the Ummah, while Allah  \uf063 says, \u201cO you \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Important Advice for the Mujahidin: Part 1", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "5"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah12-Rulings-Related-to-Giving-Da\u2019wah-to-the-Harbi-Kuffar", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "12", "schema:articleBody": "18ARTICLEARTICLE\n\fO  mujahidin!

And during the year of the Trench there was a strong coldness and a harsh wind, by which Allah turned the Ahzab away from Madinah, as He c said, \u2018And We sent upon them a wind and armies [of angels] you did not see\u2019 (Al-Ahzab 9).\n\u201cAnd  likewise,  this  year,  Allah  multiplied  in  it the snow, rain, and cold, in contradiction to what is common, until most people disliked that and we used to tell them, \u2018Do not dislike that, for indeed in this lies a wisdom and mercy from Allah.\u2019 And this was from the greatest means by which Allah turned away the  enemy.\n\u201cAnd  Allah  said  about  the  matter  of  the  Ahzab, \u2018[Remember] when they came at you from above you and from below you, and when eyes shifted [in fear], and hearts reached the throats and you assumed about Allah [various] assumptions. There the believers were tested and shaken with a severe shaking\u2019 (Al-Ahzab 10-11).\n\u201cAnd  likewise  this  year,  the  enemy  came  from the  upper  part  of  Sham...which  is  north  of  the Euphrates\u2026\u201d\nHe then continues until he says, \u201cAnd the people assumed about Allah various assumptions. This one \nthought that no one from the army of Sham would stand  and  face  them  and  they  would  eradicate  the people  of  Sham,  and  this  one  thought  that  if  they confronted  them,  [the  Mongols]  would  annihilate them  and  surround  them  just  like  the  moon  is surrounded by a glow, and this one thought that they could no longer reside in the land of Sham and that it would no longer be a land of Islam, and this one thought that they would take it (i.e. Sham) and then proceed to Misr (Egypt) and then conquer it and no one  would  stand  in  their  way,  so  he  contemplated fleeing to Yemen and other such places, and this one \u2013  thinking  somewhat  positively  \u2013  said,  \u2018They  will rule [Sham] this year as they ruled it in the year of Hulagu  in  657  AH.  Then  the  army  may  come  out from  Misr  and  rescue  it  from  them  just  as  it  came out that year.\u2019 And this is the assumption of the best among  them.  And  this  one  that  what  the  scholars of  the  prophet  narrations  informed  him  of,  along with  the  glad  tidings,  were  merely  false  hopes  and absurd  superstitions,  and  this  one  was  overcome  by fear  and  panic,  to  the  extent  that  thoughts  would enter his heart, coming and going as quickly as the passing of the clouds, as he had no mind with which to comprehend and no tongue with which to speak. And  for  this  one,  the  signs  contradicted  themselves and his desires conflicted with one another, especially because he could not distinguish with regards to the glad tidings between those which are true and those which are false, nor could he distinguish with regards to the scholars of narrations between those who were mistaken and those who were correct, nor does he know the texts of the narrations as the scholars do. Rather, he is either ignorant of them and has only heard them as  parables,  following  which  he  could  not  discern the subtle clues they contain, or even lead himself to refute  what  he  thought  contradicted  them  upon  his initial glance. For this reason, confusion took hold of him who was characterized as being guided, and the various opinions would pelt one another with him just as children pelt one another with stones. \u2018There the believers were tested and shaken with a severe shaking\u2019 (Al-Ahzab  111).  Allah  tested  them  with  this  trial, through  which  He  atones  their  mistakes  and  raises their ranks, and then He c said, \u2018And when a faction of them said, \u2018O people of Yathrib, there is no place for you [here], so return [home]\u2019\u2019 (Al-Ahzab 13).\n\u201cSo a faction of them said, \u2018There is no place for you to take up position here due to the large numbers of the enemy, so return to Madinah.\u2019 And it was said \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Rulings Related to Giving Da\u2019wah to the Harbi Kuffar", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "17"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah7-Only-Those-of-His-Slaves-with-Knowledge-Fear-Allah", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "Article\n\ftions that take people out of Islam, so many people think they are still Muslims, while in reality they have fallen into kufr and riddah.\nMany  people  think  Islam  is  like  a  citizenship  \u2013 once you get it, it remains with you until the end of your life. But Islam doesn\u2019t work with the same principle.  It  has  conditions  by  which  one  enters  it  and nullifiers by which can leave it \u2013 even without knowing it. Just as wudu, salah, and fasting can be broken by certain actions, so too can one\u2019s Islam be broken, and nothing restores it except sincere repentance. It is the responsibility of every Muslim to protect himself and others from kufr, so it is necessary to know about those actions which lead to it.\nThe  nullifiers  of  Islam  that  deal  with  democracy and man-made laws are those least mentioned. Participating in government elections and voting in them, as well as military service, working as a lawyer, and criticizing the Shari\u2019ah of Allah, are only a few of the many things which can nullify one\u2019s Islam, and all of them are easy to perpetrate when living in Dar al-Kufr. The kufr of these actions is rarely explained to the Muslims, nor are they warned about it; in fact, they are often even incited to commit them by the many evil scholars, the imams of kufr and their followers!\nThe reason for this ignorance is the lack of study of the religion among individuals. Though most of the blame for this negligence could just as easily fall upon the imams, the \u201cscholars,\u201d and the lecturers. Instead of  warning  about  shirk  and  kufr,  they  belittle  their importance,  possibly  even  recommending  that  one commits  kufr  for  the  sake  of  some  passing  worldly benefit or for the sake of \u201ctolerance.\u201d They hold firmly to what they have learned at Murjiah-run schools in the Arab world and elsewhere, teaching \u2013 in practicality \u2013 that no Muslim can truly fall into kufr, as they criticize anyone who declares the riddah of a claimant to Islam for his commission of shirk or another act of blatant kufr.\nHowever, Allah \uf063 has promised in His Book that even if the Muslims were to abandon their religion, they would be replaced by those who would remain faithful to Him and to His limits. He said, \u201cO you who believe! Whoever of you should revert from his religion, Allah will bring forth a people He will love and who will love Him, who are humble toward the believers, powerful against the disbelievers; they strive in the cause of Allah and do not fear the blame of any blamer. That is the favor of Allah, which He bestows upon whom He wills, and Allah is Encompassing and \nKnowing\u201d (Al-Maidah 54).\nPerhaps  the  fulfillment  of  this  ayah  in  our  time came  only  recently.  As  the  masses  of  \u201cMuslims\u201d  in the world have been falling day by day into kufr and riddah, into accepting only an Irja-based creed, and rejecting the clarity of the Quran and the Sunnah, it was only a matter of time that Allah would replace them  with  true  Muslims  who  applied  the  Shari\u2019ah, rejecting kufr and guarding themselves from riddah, without  appeasing  anyone  who  criticized  them  for doing  so.  The  Islamic  State  rose  from  sincerity  and was nourished by the blood of shuhada who took the fight against kufr seriously, striking at it until they met their Lord in that condition, striving in His cause.\nAnd  by  the  grace  of  Allah,  the  Islamic  State  has continued  to  have  a  firm  policy  against  kufr  and riddah. It hasn\u2019t hesitated to make takfir despite the blame  of  any  critcs.  This  is  because  it  didn\u2019t  come about to please the people, but rather, to please the Lord of creation. Thus, when the Messenger of Allah \uf067 ordered to kill anyone who leaves Islam, the Islamic State listened and obeyed, as \u201cIt is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger  have  decided  a  matter,  that  they  should have any choice in their affair\u201d (Al-Ahzab 36).\nWhen the kafir media began spreading the news about the mass executions conducted by the Islamic State in Iraq and Sham, many foolish people accused it  of  being  of  the  \u201cKhawarij.\u201d  And  when  it  burned Muath al-Kasasbeh, it was called an \u201cun-Islamic extremist organization.\u201d As many of the so-called \u201cMuslim\u201d world protested and disavowed themselves from these actions, no one brought up the kufr and riddah of which these who were executed and burned were guilty! And how could they, for they themselves didn\u2019t know what the nullifiers of Islam were or what they included.\nThere is not a single enemy which the Islamic State is fighting that is free of kufr. Those factions that it wages war against have committed at least one nullifier \u2013 and most have committed more than one \u2013 which is usually their supporting the kuffar against the Muslims, as well as their endeavor to replace the law of Allah  with  man-made  legislation.  And  even  though this fact has been brought out several times, it doesn\u2019t benefit the Muslims unless they know that these actions are, in fact, riddah and kufr. For this reason, the ignorant \u201cMuslims\u201d are blaming the Islamic State for spreading fitnah and \u201cspoiling the jihad,\u201d though the only true jihad for Allah\u2019s cause is what the Islamic \n\f", "schema:headline": "Only Those of His Slaves with Knowledge Fear Allah", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "13"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq15", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq8", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah1-The-Kafir\u2019s-Blood-is-Halal-for-You,-So-Shed-It", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "1", "schema:articleBody": "In his famous mu\u2019allaqah poem, the Jahili poet \u2018Amr Ibn Kulthum said, \u201cAnd we had many glorious and long days, we defied the king therein, lest we obey.\u201d The word he used for \u201cwe obey\u201d is \u201cnadin,\u201d from the well-known but oft-misunderstood root word \u201cdin.\u201d Usually translated as \u201creligion,\u201d and indeed it is that, one of the basic meanings of din is obedience, and is especially used \u2013 as in the above verse of poetry \u2013 in reference to the authority and rule of a king. Allah \uf063 said in the story of Yusuf \uf06e, \u201cThus We plotted for Yusuf. He would not take his brother by the din of the king\u201d (Yusuf 76), meaning, \u201cby the rule and authority of the king,\u201d or as at-Tabari commented, \u201cYusuf would not take his brother by the rule, judgment, or obedience of the king of Egypt.\u201d He then mentioned the various statements of the Salaf suggesting that \u201cdin\u201d in this ayah means sultan (authority), qada (judgment), and hukm (rule), ending his commentary by saying, \u201cAnd the basis of din is obedience.\u201d\nAs for our King \u2013 the King of mankind, the King of the Day of Recompense, the True King \uf062 \u2013 then we have entered into His din and must obey His rule wholeheartedly, and He \uf063 said, \u201cAnd fight them until there is no fitnah and the din is for Allah. But if they cease, then there is no aggression except against the tyrants\u201d (Al-Baqarah 193). So the command of Allah \u2013 to which obedience is due as a religious duty \u2013 is to fight until there is no fitnah, i.e. evident shirk in the obedience of Allah, and until no manifest authority \nis given to any rule except to that of the True King. His saying, \u201cif they cease,\u201d means that if they submit or surrender, then they are to be left alone. This can either be in the form of repentance to Allah and abiding  by  His  worship  alone  or  by  the  paying  of  jizyah while  remaining  upon  subjugated  kufr,  just  as  Allah said, regarding the command of killing the mushrikin in general, \u201cThen if they repent, establish the prayer, and pay the zakah, then leave them alone\u201d (At-Tawbah 5), and He said that the People of the Book \u2013 those who \u201cdo not adhere to the true din\u201d \u2013 should specifically be fought \u201cuntil they pay the jizyah willingly, while they are humiliated\u201d (At-Tawbah 29).\nAnd  \u201cthere  is  no  aggression  except  against  the  tyrants\u201d means those who did not submit nor surrender, either through repentance or dhimmah, the covenant of jizyah. Thus, anyone who is neither a Muslim nor a  dhimmi  kafir  (while  still  a  tyrant  against  himself, deserving both hatred and humiliation) is a hostile tyrant deserving aggression. This is because shirk itself is dhulm  (tyranny),  as  Allah  said,  \u201cAnd  when  Luqman said to his son, admonishing him, \u2018O my son, do not commit shirk with Allah. Verily shirk is a great tyranny\u2019\u201d (Luqman 13). And although the people of dhimmah are mushrikin from the People of the Book, their shirk is subjugated and humiliated under the Shari\u2019ah of Allah enforced upon them.\nSo the duty to fight the tyrants \u2013 the mushrikin \u2013 is \n3434\n\fclear and established. But Allah did not only command the \u201cfighting\u201d of disbelievers, as if to say He only wants us to conduct frontline operations against them. Rather, He has also ordered that they be slain wherever they may be \u2013 on or off the battlefield. He \uf063 said, \u201cSo when the sacred months have  passed,  then  kill  the  mushrikin  wherever  you  find them and take them, surround them, and wait for them at every outpost\u201d (At-Tawbah 5). All of this becomes all the more apparent for those who have realized that the blood of a kafir is cheap, filthy, and permissible to shed.\nIslam  is  the  religion  of  sound  principles  providing  the perfect  foundations  upon  which  the  solid  structures  of justice and glory are built. One of these great principles is that all people must be fought until they accept Islam or come under a shar\u2019i covenant. This principle establishes the prohibition of shedding Muslim and covenant-bound kafir blood as well as the permissibility of shedding the blood of all other kuffar. The Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cI have been ordered to fight mankind until they say that there is no god except Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah, and they establish the prayer and pay the zakah. Whoever does so, then his blood and wealth are safe from me except for a lawful reason\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar), and he \uf067 said, addressing the Muslims, \u201cFor verily your blood, wealth, and honor are haram to each other\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Bakrah). And regarding the dhimmi \u2013 the one who has a covenant with the Muslims \u2013the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever kills a person of covenant shall not smell the fragrance of Jannah, which can be found for a distance of forty years\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from \u2018Abdullah Ibn \u2018Amr). These narrations offer an explanation of the ayah, \u201cAnd do not kill a soul which Allah has forbidden except for a lawful reason\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 151), about which at-Tabari said, \u201cThe soul which Allah has forbidden is the soul of a believer or a person of covenant, and His saying, \u2018except for a lawful reason,\u2019 means that which permits such a soul to be killed, as in capital punishment for murder, or stoning an adulterer to death, or killing someone for apostasy.\u201d\nAs for all others \u2013 meaning all disbelievers who have no covenant \u2013 then their blood has not been given the sanctity of prohibition, but remains under the command to fight mankind, so their blood remains halal. Shedding the blood of a non-dhimmi kafir is not sinful, but is rather rewarded with Jannah. Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cA kafir and his killer will never be gathered together in the Fire\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah). Furthermore, his words, \u201cI have been ordered to fight mankind,\u201d leave no room for debate, as mankind includes every person in the world, and the only ones excluded from this order to fight are those who submit or surrender to the rule of Islam, as was previously mentioned. This alone befits a messenger who was sent to all people, as Allah \uf062 said, \u201cSay, \u2018O mankind, verily I am the Messenger of Allah sent to all of you\u2019\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 158), and the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cOther prophets were sent to their people alone, but I was sent to all of mankind\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Jabir Ibn \u2018Abdillah).\nLest  someone  think  this  is  a  strange,  new  opinion,  it should be known that this is the stance of the Sahabah and the greatest scholars of the Ummah. This is reflected in the words of \u2018Umar Ibn al-Khattab who, during the life of the Prophet \uf067 and without objection, said to Abu Jandal, encouraging him to kill his father Suhayl Ibn \u2018Amr, \u201cBe patient, Abu Jandal, for they are merely mushrikin, and their blood is nothing but (like) the blood of a dog\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from al-Miswar Ibn Makhramah). Indeed, \u2018Umar was correct, as the mushrikin are entirely impure, as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cO you who believe! The mushrikin are nothing but impure\u201d (At-Tawbah 28).\nThis  is  also  understood  from  the  words  of  Anas  Ibn Malik, who was asked, \u201cO Abu Hamzah! What makes a slave\u2019s (i.e. a person\u2019s) blood and wealth haram?\u201d He replied, \u201cWhoever testifies that there is no god but Allah, faces our qiblah, prays our prayer, and eats what we slaughter, then he is a Muslim. He gets what a Muslim gets and is bound by what a Muslim is bound\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Maymum Ibn Siyah).\nAsh-Shafi\u2019i said, \u201cAnd the kafir\u2019s blood is not spared until he becomes a Muslim\u201d (Al-Umm). In further explanation, he  said,  \u201cAllah  spared  blood  and  restricted  the  taking  of wealth, except for a lawful reason, through belief in Allah and in His Messenger or through a covenant given by the believers, based on the rule of Allah and His Messenger, to the People of the Book. And He allowed shedding the blood of mature men who refrain from belief and who do not have a covenant. Allah \uf066 said, \u2018So when the sacred months have passed, then kill the mushrikin wherever you find them and take them, surround them, and wait for them at every outpost\u2019  (At-Tawbah  5)\u201d  (Al-Umm).  Mentioning  the  exception of killing women and children, he also said, \u201cAnd the reason for the prohibition of shedding Muslim blood being different from the prohibition of shedding the kafir child\u2019s and kafir woman\u2019s blood is that they are not to be killed due to specific revelation restricting this killing [while the initial ruling allows shedding kafir blood in general]. And our opinion regarding this \u2013 and Allah knows best \u2013 is that the restriction exists so that they can become slaves, which is more beneficial than killing them, and killing them does not harm the enemy; so making them slaves is more optimal than killing them\u201d (Al-Umm).\nAl-Khattabi said, \u201cThe kafir\u2019s blood is permissible because he has not yet uttered the word of tawhid; but if he were to say it, then his blood is spared and becomes prohibited\u201d (A\u2019lam al-Hadith).\nIbn  Hazm,  after  mentioning  the  prohibition  of  targeting women and children, said, \u201cAnd it is permissible to kill anyone \u2013 other than those we mentioned above \u2013 of the mushrikin,  both  the  combatant  and  non-combatant,  the businessman and employee, the elderly man \u2013 whether or not he be a person of influence \u2013 the farmer, the bishop or priest or monk, the blind or crippled \u2013 no one is given exception\u201d  (Al-Muhalla).\n35\n\fIbn Qudamah mentioned the harbi (the kafir who is not under  a  covenant)  and  said,  \u201cShedding  his  blood  is  permissible without exception, just like swine\u201d (Al-Mughni). He also said, \u201cThe kuffar asliyyin [those kuffar who are not murtaddin]  shall  have  no  protection  in  their  own  lands\u201d (Al-Mughni).\nIbn Rushd said, \u201cAnd the principle is that what makes wealth permissible to take is kufr, and that which protects it is Islam, just as the Prophet \uf067 said, \u2018Then if they said that, they have protected their blood and their wealth from me\u2019\u201d  (Bidayat  al-Mujtahid).  While  specifically  mentioning wealth, his words clearly point to the permissibility of bloodshed as is also in the evidence he quoted.\nAl-Qurtubi, said, \u201cIf a Muslim meets a kafir who has no \ncovenant, it is permissible for him to kill him.\u201d\nAbu Hanifah said, regarding a kafir who is killed, \u201cThere is no retaliation (against the killer) and the diyah (blood money) is not to be paid, because the blood of the kafir is permissible (to shed) unless it is established that he has a covenant or is under dhimmah\u201d (Al-Hawi al-Kabir). Likewise, the famous Hanafi scholar al-Kashani said, \u201cThe principle is that it is permissible to kill anyone from amongst the people who are at war (with the Muslims), whether they fight or do not fight. But it is not permissible to kill anyone who is not from the people who are at war [meaning those with a valid covenant], unless they fight or offer strategic support, obedience, instigation, or otherwise. So the priest and wandering ascetic who mix with the people are to be killed, as are those who have fits of insanity, and the deaf \nand mute, and the one with a severed hand or foot, even if they did not fight. This is because they are from the same people who are at war [with the Muslims]\u201d (Badai\u2019 as-Sanai\u2019).\nNone of this should be surprising to any Muslim who has studied his religion, as this matter of a kafir\u2019s blood being halal to shed is something upon which scholars have recorded consensus. At-Tabari said, \u201cThey [the scholars of Islam] have agreed that even if a mushrik were to wear the bark of all the trees of the Haram [in Makkah] around his neck and on his arms, that would not grant him safety from being killed unless the Muslims gave him a covenant of dhimmah or security.\u201d\nMuslims currently living in Dar al-Kufr must be reminded  that  the  blood  of  the  disbelievers  is  halal,  and  killing them is a form of worship to Allah, the Lord, King, and God of mankind. This includes the businessman riding to work in a taxicab, the young adults (post-pubescent \u201cchildren\u201d) engaged in sports activities in the park, and the old man waiting in line to buy a sandwich. Indeed, even the blood of the kafir street vendor selling flowers to those passing by is halal to shed \u2013 and striking terror into the hearts of all disbelievers is a Muslim\u2019s duty. There is no shar\u2019i requirement to target soldiers and policemen nor judges and politicians, but all kuffar who are not under the covenant of dhimmah are fair game. How can the disbelievers ever dream of safety and security while Muslims suffer anywhere in the world and while the rule of Allah is mockingly replaced by manmade monstrosities of democracy?\n...Even the blood of a merry Crusader citizen selling flowers to passersby \n36\n\f37\n\f38\n\f", "schema:headline": "The Kafir\u2019s Blood is Halal for You, So Shed It", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "33"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah1-The-Wicked-Scholars-Are-Cursed", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "1", "schema:articleBody": "Allah has honored knowledge and its people, raising their worth and elevating their status.

Likewise, Allah negated any equality between the scholars and others. He \uf063 said, \u201cSay, \u2018Are those who know and those who do not know equal?\u2019 Only those with deep understanding will remember\u201d (Az-Zumar 9).\nAnd Allah ordered to refer to them, as He \uf063 said, \u201cThen ask the people of remembrance if you do not know\u201d (AnNahl 43).

Once a  correlation  is  made  between  knowledge  and  action,  it follows that there is no action without knowledge and no knowledge  without  action.\nAs for knowledge accompanied by good deeds, then it is what yields fear of Allah, bearing a person to publicly declare the truth lest he earn Allah\u2019s anger and punishment. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cOnly those who fear Allah, of His slaves, are the knowledgeable ones\u201d (Fatir 28), and Ibn \u2018Abbas \uf06b said, \n\u201cThose who are knowledgeable of Allah are those who fear him\u201d (Az-Zuhd \u2013 Abu Dawud). And Ibn Mas\u2019ud \uf068 said, \u201cKnowledge is not an abundance of reports, but knowledge is fear [of Allah]\u201d (Hilyat al-Awliya).\nLikewise, one of the deeds directly correlated to knowledge is jihad for Allah\u2019s cause, for jihad is the companion of knowledge, as found in the hadith in which the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cFor whomever Allah wants well, He gives him fiqh (comprehension) of the religion, and there will not cease to be a group of Muslims fighting upon the truth, defeating whoever opposes them, until the Day of Resurrection\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Mu\u2019awiyah).\nThe mentioning of both knowledge and jihad in this hadith indicates the correlation between the two, and that the people thereof are the victorious group (at-Taifat al-Mansurah); so upholding the religion and manifesting the truth cannot come about except through knowledge and jihad.\nThis was the situation of the Sahabah \uf06a, those who were the  most  knowledgeable  of  the  Ummah,  as  they  joined knowledge with jihad. Whoever looks into the biographies of the Sahabah, whether from the Muhajirin or the Ansar, will find that many of them were killed on the fronts of jihad, fully achieving knowledge and action. On the Day of Yamamah, for example, the memorizers of Allah\u2019s Book began to be killed, as when the banner fell, Salim Mawla Abi Hudhayfah \uf06b took hold of it. The Muslims said to him, \u201cO Salim! We fear that we will be overtaken from your direction.\u201d So he said, \u201cWhat a wicked bearer of the Quran I would be if you were overtaken from my direction!\u201d So he went forth and fought until he was killed (At-Tabaqat al-Kubra).\n28\fim said, \u201cThe ten days of Dhul-Hijjah were deemed virtuous due to the days they include, for included among them is the day of slaughter, the day of \u2018Arafah, and the day of Tarwiyah [the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah, the day in which hajj is commenced]\u201d (Zad al-Ma\u2019ad).\nMaking Much Dhikr: Allah \uf063 said, \u201cThat they may witness benefits for themselves and mention the name of Allah on known days\u201d (Al-Hajj 28). Ibn Rajab said, \u201cThe bulk of the scholars hold the view that these known days are the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah\u201d (Al-Lataif).\nAmong these ten days is a day that is great according to Allah. It is the day of \u2018Arafah, the witnessed day, the day on which Allah completed the religion, and fasting on it expiates the sins of two years. Also among these days is the day of slaughter, which is the greatest day of the year, the day of the greater hajj on which comprises a number of  acts  of  obedience  and  worship  that  are  not  gathered together on any other day.\nFor this reason, the Prophet \uf067 enjoined upon the Muslims much tahlil (saying \u201cla ilaha illallah\u201d), takbir (saying \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d), and tahmid (saying \u201calhamdulillah\u201d) in these days, as in his \uf067 statement, \u201cThere are no days that are greater according to Allah or on which a deed is more beloved to Him than these ten days, so make much tahlil, takbir, and tahmid in them\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from Ibn \u2018Umar).\nIndeed, reaching these ten days is a tremendous blessing from the blessings of Allah \uf063 upon His slaves, which none but the worshipers and the diligent truly appreciate. So the obligation upon the Muslim slave is to perceive this blessing and take advantage of this opportunity, for the Salaf would be diligent in worship on these days more so than any other day, as established in their beautiful biographies.\nAl-Bukhari said in his \u201cSahih,\u201d \u201c\u2018Umar RA would make takbir in his tent in Mina and the people in the masjid would hear him, so they would make takbir, and the people in the market would make takbir, to the point that Mina  would  shake  with  takbir.  Ibn  \u2018Umar  would  make takbir in Mina on those days, and would do so after the prayers, and on his mattress, in his pavilion, in his gatherings, and on the pathways throughout all those days.\u201d\nThere are many virtuous deeds that the Muslim should strive to perform on these days, such as jihad for the cause of Allah, reciting the Quran, diligently attending the congregational prayer in the masajid, being dutiful to one\u2019s parents, upholding the ties of kinship, being good to one\u2019s neighbors,  reconciling  between  people,  honoring  one\u2019s guest, spending for the cause of Allah, visiting the sick, etc. However, there are certain deeds that are specified for these days, including:\nTherefore, takbir is from among the deeds of the Sunnah specified for these ten days, and it is of two types: takbir performed generally and takbir performed at a specific time. Takbir is performed, in general, at all times, from the first of the ten days to the end of the days of tashriq (the 13th of Dhul-Hijjah). As for the takbir performed at a specific time, it is done after the five daily prayers (after the salam in the obligatory prayers) and it begins from fajr on the day of \u2018Arafah \u2013 for those not performing hajj \u2013 and lasts until \u2018asr on the last day of tashriq, as was reported \nThe hujjaj at Mount \u2018Arafah\n\f", "schema:headline": "The Wicked Scholars Are Cursed", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "27"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah9-The-Woman-Is-a-Shepherd-in-Her-Husband\u2019s-Home", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "9", "schema:articleBody": "Every woman to whom Allah has granted the blessing of giving birth in the Islamic State should take advantage of this tremendous grace \u2013 which Allah c has not granted to many other women \u2013 and painstakingly endeavor to raise her children in a manner that pleases her Lord and brings benefit to her ummah. And why should she not? For she is the child-rearing, nursing, and educating mother, whereas the fathers are either working for the cause of Allah or stationed in ribat.\n\u2018Abdullah Ibn \u2018Umar \uf06b narrated, saying, \u201cI heard Allah\u2019s Messenger g say, \u2018Every one of you is a shepherd and every one of you is responsible for his flock. The man is a shepherd over his family and is responsible  for  his  flock,  the  woman  is  a  shepherd  in  her husband\u2019s home and is responsible for her flock, and the servant is a shepherd over his master\u2019s wealth and is responsible for his flock\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and  Muslim).\nSisters\n\fObedience was never just a type of worship, rather it is worship itself, for it is obedience to Allah in accordance with that which He has ordered upon the tongues  of  His  messengers  \uf070,  and  that  he  doesn\u2019t obey  anyone  from  among  the  creation  except  that this obedience of his falls under Allah\u2019s obedience, otherwise it is not necessary to obey any of the creation independently \u2013 and what is meant here is the obedience that is specific to making haram what is halal  or  making  halal  what  is  haram.  So  whoever obeys a created being in that regard \u2013 other than the Messenger g, for he does not speak from his whims \u2013 then he is a mushrik, as Allah c made clear in His statement, \u201cThey have taken their scribes\u201d meaning their  scholars,  \u201cand  monks\u201d  meaning  their  devout worshipers  \u201cas  lords  besides  Allah,  and  [also]  the Messiah, the son of Mary. And they were not commanded except to worship one God; there is no god except Him. Exalted is He above whatever they associate with Him\u201d (At-Tawbah 31). This was explained by the Prophet g as their obedience in making haram what is halal, and making halal what is haram, as will be mentioned in the hadith of \u2018Adi.\nSo  if  it  is  said  that  Allah  c  has  stated,  \u201cO  you who  have  believed,  obey  Allah  and  obey  the  Messenger and those in authority among you\u201d (An-Nisa 59), then it is said, they are the scholars, and it is said they are the leaders, and these are two explanations reported from Ahmad. Ibnul-Qayyim said, \u201cAnalysis  reveals  that  the  verse  encompasses  both  groups. It  is  said  that  it  is  obligatory  to  obey  them  if  they command obedience to Allah and obedience to His Messenger. The scholars are conveyers of the orders of Allah and the orders of His Messenger, and those in authority are the executors of those orders, so it then becomes obligatory to obey them in accordance with obedience to Allah and His Messenger, as he g said, \u2018There is no obedience in disobedience, rather obedience is in what is righteous\u2019 (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). He g also said, \u2018Upon a person is to listen and obey as long as he is not ordered with disobedience,  for  if  he  is  ordered  with  disobedience  then there is no listening and no obeying.\u2019 Both ahadith are sahih, so there is nothing in this verse that contradicts the verse of Baraah (i.e. At-Tawbah).\n\u201cIbn \u2018Abbas said, \u2018Stones are about to rain on you from the sky! I say: \u2018Allah\u2019s Messenger g said,\u2019 and you say: \u2018Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar said?!\u2019\u2019\n[\u2026]\u201cThis is what Ibn \u2018Abbas said to one who disputed \nwith him regarding combining Hajj and \u2018Umrah in the time of Hajj, which Ibn \u2018Abbas used to order. The one  disputing  challenged  him  with  Abu  Bakr  and \u2018Umar\u2019s  prohibition  of  this,  implying,  \u2018They  both are more knowledgeable than you [Ibn \u2018Abbas] and more deserving of being followed.\u2019 So Ibn \u2018Abbas said those words that were pronounced from pure faith and from the absolute nature of his following of Allah\u2019s Messenger g, regardless if anyone opposed him for that \u2013 and regardless of who they may be \u2013 as ash-Shafi\u2019i said, \u2018The scholars have agreed that whoever the Sunnah of Allah\u2019s Messenger g has become apparent to, it is not for him to leave it on account of the saying of any other person\u2019\u201d (Madarij as-Salikin).So if that was the saying of Ibn \u2018Abbas to the one who opposed him with Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar \u2013 and they are who they are \u2013 what would you expect he would say to one who opposes the Sunnah of Allah\u2019s Messenger g with his imam or the founder of his madhhab, which he attributes himself to, and makes his statement a standard of measure over the Quran and Sunnah, such that whatever is in agreement with his madhhab he accepts and whatever opposes it he rejects or reinterprets?! And Allah\u2019s help is sought.\nAnd how good is that which was stated by some of \nthe later scholars:\nSo if there came to them evidence in agreementWith what the preceding forefathers were uponThey\u2019d be pleased or say, \u201cThis needs interpretation,\u201dAnd they would go to great lengths to interpret it.And  there  is  no  doubt  that  this  falls  under  the statement of Allah c, \u201cThey took their scribes and monks  as  lords  besides  Allah\u2026\u201d  (At-Tawbah  31).\nShaykh  Muhammad  Ibn  \u2018Abdil-Wahhab  said, \u201cAhmad Ibn Hanbal said, \u2018I am amazed at a people who know the authenticity of a chain of narrators, yet they go to the opinion of Sufyan, while Allah c says, \u2018So let those beware who dissent from his (i.e. the Prophet\u2019s) order, lest fitnah strike them\u2019 (An-Nur 63). Do you know what that fitnah is? That fitnah is shirk. Perhaps if he were to reject some of his statements there would fall into his heart something of deviance and he would therefore perish.\u2019 This was the statement of Ahmad, reported from him by al-Fadl Ibn Ziyad and Abu Talib.\n\u201cAl-Fadl  narrated  that  Ahmad  said,  \u2018I  looked  in the  Quran  and  I  found  [the  order  to  have]  obedience to the Messenger in thirty-three places.\u2019 Then he began to recite the verse, \u2018So let those beware who dissent from his (i.e. the Prophet\u2019s) order, lest fitnah \n\f", "schema:headline": "The Woman Is a Shepherd in Her Husband\u2019s Home", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "17"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah13-The-Hijrah-of-Umm-Sulaym-al-Muhajirah", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "13", "schema:articleBody": "My hijrah to the Islamic State was a journey not \nunlike  that  undertaken  by  many  others  who sought to leave the lands of kufr and reside in the lands of tawhid.

That is best for you if you only knew\u201d (AsSaff 10-11). Belief in Allah \uf063 and waging jihad for His cause with wealth and soul are emphasized here, and jihad using one\u2019s  wealth  is  mentioned  first  because wealth is used initially in order to prepare equipment  and  arm  the  troops,  and  because jihad using one\u2019s physical self (soul) has exemptions \u2013 those who are excused from fighting \u2013 and the woman is exempt therefrom. As for waging jihad with one\u2019s wealth,  then  there  is  no  excuse  for  anyone whom Allah has enriched from His bounty and who has yet to spend. There is  no  difference,  in  this  regard,  between men and women, the old and the young, the blind and the seeing, and the sick and the healthy. As for the one who is poor, \nthen there is no sin upon him for not being able to spend, due to the saying of  Allah  \uf063,  \u201cNor  upon  those  who, when they came to you in order that you carry them (to battle), you said, \u2018I do not have that upon which to carry you\u2019\u201d  (At-Tawbah  92).\nAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cWage jihad  against  the  mushrikin  with  your wealth, your souls, and your tongues\u201d (Reported by Abu Dawud from Anas).\nRegarding  the  wisdom  in  mentioning jihad with one\u2019s wealth before jihad with one\u2019s soul, Ibnul-Qayyim \uf072 said, \u201cAnd a second point of interest is that wealth  is  dearly  beloved  by  the  soul, which exerts its effort in obtaining it, undergoes risks, and may even be exposed  to  death  while  seeking  it.

This led to the mujahidin assault unit taking  control  of  the  village.\nIn  the  area  of Tallat  Safiyyah,  situated  west  of  the  village  of  Kashkash Jubur  and  where  the  murtaddin  had stationed  themselves  in  heavily  fortified  positions,  a  group  of  inghimasiyyin  stormed  their  positions  and  the murtaddin  turned  and  fled  without any  confrontation.\nAllah  granted  victory  to  the  soldiers of the Islamic State as they broke through  the  front  line  of  defense  of the PKK murtaddin in less than two hours,  causing  a  breakdown  in  the ranks  of  the  murtaddin.\nby  the  murtaddin.  One  group  of  inghimasiyyin  entered  from  the  side  of Hammadat,  towards  the  village  of Shaykh  \u2018Uthman,  situated  southwest of  Shaddadi.  Meanwhile,  a  second group  of  inghimasiyyin  entered  the village of \u2018Adlah, the gateway to Shadadi from its southern side. After cutting off the roads and surrounding the murtaddin  in  the  village  of  \u2018Azzawi, the istishhadi brother, Abu Mus\u2019ab Suwaydan \uf08a, targeted a gathering close to the enemy\u2019s position at the school, which was taken as their second defensive line away from the village. This resulted in the killing and wounding of many  within  their  ranks.\nThis was followed by an attack by the mujahidin,  whereby  they  penetrated deep within the territory of the murtaddin. They proceeded to assault the villages  of  Shaykh  \u2018Uthman  and  \u2018Adlah,  which  represented  a  great  threat to  the  murtaddin  who  had  already started  gathering  their  forces  in  the desert, close to the village of \u2018Azzawiyyah, north of Tallat Safiyyah. While they were gathering forces, the istishhadi brother Abu Qudamah Hatlah \uf08a embarked, first chasing them down as they attempted to flee, then detonating his explosive vehicle in their midst.What then followed was a huge collapse in morale within the ranks of the PKK.  Fearing  this  collapse  and  the arrival of the soldiers of the Khilafah to the city of Shaddadi, the Crusaders \nrushed  to  send  their  warplanes,  dispatching  A10s,  B52s,  F16s,  and  unmanned Predator drones, which then began conducting dozens of systematic airstrikes on the villages taken by the mujahidin,  and  completely  destroying  some  of  the  villages,  particularly the village of Kashkash Zayyanat. This forced  the  mujahidin  to  withdraw from some of the villages that they had previously  entered.\nThe soldiers of the Islamic State took advantage  of  their  ability  to  transfer the  battle  from  one  area  to  another, maneuvering  to  avoid  the  warplanes. In this manner, they were able to attack an area, stop, and then maneuver and attack an alternate area, dispersing the effects of the Crusader warplanes.The soldiers of the Khilafah also assaulted the village of Albu Salman, west of Shaddadi. The assault began with an istishhadi brother setting out towards a gathering of murtaddin, sending them fleeing from the village. The istishhadi brother continued pursuing the murtaddin,  chasing  them,  but  returned shortly  after  without  needing  to  detonate his explosive vehicle as all of the murtaddin  had  fled.  The  mujahidin then  took  control  of  the  village,  taking as ghanimah a 4-wheel drive vehicle mounted with a 14.5mm machine gun, an ammunition-filled truck, and a hummer.\nAdditionally, the soldiers of the Khilafah conducted a raid on a group of murtaddin in the village of \u2018Inad, close to  Shaddadi.  The  istishhadi  brother Abul-Bara  Muhasan  \uf08a  advanced  towards  them,  detonating  his  explosive vehicle  in  the  midst  of  their  vehicles parked next to one of their barracks in the  village,  destroying  their  barracks and all those inside.\nThese operations resulted in the killing of around 124 murtaddin and the wounding  of  dozens  of  others.  The soldiers of the Khilafah, as a result of their battles in the village of \u2018Azzawi, also  succeeded  in  capturing  three  of the  murtaddin.\nHalab Wilayah\nOn  the  15th  of  Dhul-Qa\u2019dah,  in  a second special operation targeting the Crusaders  and  murtadd  PKK  in  the housing area of the Faruq Dam, which is  considered  a  heavily  fortified  barracks for the Americans, as well as the \nlocation  of  their  military  operations room  from  where  they  supervise  the battles  around  Manbij,  a  group  consisting of 5 inghimasiyyin of the Khilafah  assaulted  the  enemy,  clashing with the murtaddin inside. The assault began at Fajr and continued until \u2018Asr of the same day. During the course of the attack, American warplanes intervened, carrying out a number of airstrikes  in  support  of  the  murtaddin. There was no way to credibly verify the extent of losses incurred by the murtaddin as a result of the assault.\nThe area of the Faruq Dam had witnessed a similar attack on the 7th of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah,  when  7  inghimasiyyin conducted  an  attack  that  resulted  in the killing and wounding of 41 PKK fighters  and  American  soldiers.\nOn the same day, 4 soldiers of the Khilafah carried out an inghimasi assault  on  locations  of  the  PKK  murtaddin in the village of \u2018Imarah, north of  the  city  of  Manbij.

This was until they began a wide scale military campaign against the city with Russian air support at the start of the month of Jumada al-Akhirah in 1437. They mobilized thousands of ground troops (including army forces, Rafidi militias, Russian ground forces, and Russian advisors) in simultaneous coordination with a heavy aerial bombardment campaign, and on average the city\u2019s neighborhoods would be bombarded with approximately 100 rockets, barrel bombs, and explosive gas cylinders each day. The mujahidin were forced to withdraw from the city in the middle of the same month, following which the Nusayri regime sought to expand its areas of control in the city\u2019s surrounding areas.

He then said, \u2018I will perform hijrah with you.\u2019 So  the  Prophet  g  told  some  of  his  companions  to look after him and teach him. Then, when there was a battle, the Prophet g took some ghanimah. So he divided it and allotted for the Bedouin a share, and gave that share to his companions. The Bedouin had taken their animals out to pasture, and when he came back they gave him his share. So he said, \u2018What is this?\u2019 They said, \u2018A share which the Prophet g has allotted for you.\u2019 So he took it and came with it to the Prophet g and said to him, \u2018What is this?\u2019 He said, \u2018I allotted it for you.\u2019 The Bedouin said, \u2018It is not for this that I followed you. Rather, I followed you so that I would be struck here \u2013 and he pointed to his throat \u2013 by an arrow and die, and then enter Jannah!\u2019 So the Prophet g said, \u2018Indeed, Allah will be truthful to you.\u2019 They then remained for a short time and then rose to fight the  enemy.  He  was  then  carried  to  the  Prophet  g having been hit by an arrow in the spot he had pointed to, so the Prophet g said, \u2018Is it him?\u2019 They said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 So he said, \u2018He was truthful to Allah, so Allah was truthful to him.\u2019 The Prophet g then shrouded him with his garment. He then brought him forward and prayed over him, and among that which he said in his prayer was, \u2018O Allah, this is Your slave.

Their goal in that regards is to fill the mujahidin with despair by terrifying them with the threat of a large number of losses in their ranks if they continue in their fight and jihad against the mushrikin and their insistence on removing shirk and establishing the religion.\nThis  is  the  habit  of  the  kuffar  in  every  era,  and that is because they measure all affairs based on material,  dunya-oriented  results,  which  is  all  that  they know.  This  is  just  the  same  as  what  was  previously done by one of their leaders following the Battle of Uhud, when he boasted about killing the companions of Allah\u2019s Messenger g, seeking therewith to fill the remaining Muslims with sorrow. But they replied to him saying that they were not eaqual, for those killed from among the Muslims were in Jannah, and those killed from among the mushrikin were in Hellfire.And Allah\u2019s c command has come to His muwahhid slaves in every era that their wounds must not stop them from increasing their pursuit of the mushrikin and their endeavor to fight them, kill them, and seize their land and wealth, as in His c statement, \u201cAnd \ndo not weaken in pursuing the enemy. If you should be suffering - so are they suffering as you are suffering, but you expect from Allah that which they expect not. And Allah is ever Knowing and Wise\u201d (An-Nisa 104). So war is not only conquest and ghanimah. Rather, it includes wounds, pain, weariness, fatigue, the exhaustion of men and equipment, and the depletion of wealth and resources.\nBut  with  everything  they  sacrifice  for  the  cause of Allah, the muwahhidin hope to attain nearness to Him c, and to draw more of the victory which He grants to His slaves when He sees the truthfulness of their jihad. And even as they seek victory against their enemies, they know with certainty that there is even greater  reward  for  them  if  they  are  defeated  in  war after having purified their intentions and exerted their efforts, as the Prophet g said, \u201cNo fighter or detachment carries out a raid, takes ghanimah, and returns safely except that they have received two thirds of their rewards, and no fighter or detachment fails to acquire ghanimah  and  is  afflicted  except  that  their  rewards will be given in full\u201d (Reported by Muslim). So after every defeat, they make more sacrifices for the sake of pleasing the Lord of the heavens and the earth, until the religion becomes entirely for Allah or they perish in the process, just as their Lord c described them in \nThe mujahidin continue to pursue and punish the kuffar\n\f", "schema:headline": "They Say, \"We Fear That a Calamity May Strike Us\"", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq6", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://gsi.dit.upm.es/#scrapingActivity", "@type": "schema:Article"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah11-And-When-the-Believers-Saw-the-Confederates", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "All praise is due to Allah, who said in His Book, \u201cAnd  when  the  believers  saw  the  confederates,  they said,  \u2018This  is  what  Allah  and  His  Messenger  had promised us, and Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth.\u2019 And it increased them only in faith and acceptance\u201d  (Al-Ahzab  22).\nI bear witness that there is no god but Allah, alone and without partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad  is  His  slave  and  messenger,  whom  Allah  sent with the sword before the Hour as a bringer of glad tidings and a warner, and as a caller to Allah with His permission and an illuminating lamp. Through him Allah established the proof, clarified the correct path, and brought triumph to the true religion. He waged jihad in the path of Allah until the religion became upright by him. May Allah\u2019s blessings and abundant peace be upon him, and upon his family. As for what follows:\nIndeed, from the sunnah (established way) of Allah \uf063 which neither alters nor changes is that He tests His believing slaves, as He \uf063 has informed us with His statement, \u201cDo the people think that they will be left to say, \u2018We believe\u2019 and they will not be tried? But We have certainly tried those before them, and Allah will surely make evident those who are truthful, and He  will  surely  make  evident  the  liars\u201d  (Al-Ankabut 2-3).\nHe \uf063 also said, \u201cAnd if Allah had willed, He could have taken vengeance upon them [Himself], but [He ordered armed struggle] to test some of you by means of others. And those who are killed in the cause of Allah - never will He waste their deeds\u201d (Muhammad 4).\nThus, it was it was a must for the believer to accustom himself to facing trials. It is mentioned in the qudsi hadith which the Messenger g narrates from his  Lord  \uf063,  \u201cIndeed,  my  Lord  commanded  me  to teach you what you are ignorant of, from among that which He taught me today. [He said,] \u2018Every wealth which I grant to [My] slave is halal. Indeed, I creat-\ned all My slaves inclining to tawhid, and indeed the devils came to them and took them away from their religion, forbade from them what I had permitted for them, and ordered them to ascribe partners to me for whom I have not revealed any authority.\u2019 And indeed Allah looked to the people of the earth and detested them \u2013 the Arabs among them and the non-Arabs \u2013 except for some who remained from among the people of the Scripture, and He said, \u2018I have only sent you in order to try you and to try by way of you, and I have revealed to you a book which water cannot wash (i.e. which will be preserved in the people\u2019s breasts), and which you will read while asleep and while awake (i.e. with ease).\u2019 And indeed Allah commanded me to burn Quraysh, so I said, \u2018My Lord, then they will split my head like a piece of bread.\u2019 He said, \u2018Expel them as they expelled you, raid them and we will aid you, spend and We shall spend on you, send forth an army and We shall send forth five of its like, and fight those who disobey you with those who obey you\u2019\u201d (Reported by Muslim).\nAnd these trials which the Islamic State is passing through today \u2013 of the gathering of the paths of kufr and the factions against it \u2013 are but an affirmation of that promise. So we do not say except as our righteous predecessors from among the companions of Allah\u2019s Messenger  g  said  when  they  saw  the  confederates, \u201c\u2018This is what Allah and His Messenger had promised us,  and  Allah  and  His  Messenger  spoke  the  truth.\u2019 And it increased them only in faith and acceptance\u201d (Al-Ahzab 22).\nAnd indeed, Allah revealed in Surat Al-Baqarah, \u201cOr do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until [even their] messenger  and  those  who  believed  with  him  said, \u2018When is the help of Allah?\u2019 Unquestionably, the help of Allah is near\u201d (Al-Baqarah 214).

This  was  because  it meant \u2013 based on their corrupt principle \u2013 that the people had to remain without a jama\u2019ah, and without \nan imam who they could rally behind, pray behind, and fight their enemies behind, and without a judge who would settle their disputes, all this in addition to the rulings of the Shari\u2019ah being suspended and the people submitting to the rulings of the tawaghit, and in addition to the rites of the religion being abolished and its symbols ceasing to exist. And all this so that there  would  come  about  the  conditions  which  they claim are necessary for the emergence of their absent, fabricated  imam  in  order  to  rule  them,  lead  them, and govern them with justice, and rule them with the Shari\u2019ah.\nFrom the Leadership of an Infallible Person to \nWilayat al-Faqih\nGeneration  after  generation,  the  tawaghit  of  the Rafidah  would  endeavor  to  free  themselves  of  the shackles which they had placed on their own necks and the fetters with which they had bound their own hands and feet, and would endeavor to come out of the trap which they had dug themselves into. So they began  to  work  on  justifying  their  fulfillment  of  the roles which they had previously confined to their absent  imam,  beginning  with  issuing  fatawa,  judging, collecting the khums, and overseeing the awqaf (endowments) and the wealth of the orphans, until they eventually made the claim that they had the right to rule the people as deputies of the imam, and claimed that they had taken that right with regards to all of that  from  the  absent  imam,  either  through  letters falsely attributed to him, or narrations falsely attributed  to  their  previous  imams.

So he is required to act justly towards it, take care of its interests, and will be asked as to whether he fulfilled what was obligatory on him concerning his flock or did not.\nWhen  the  Prophet  g  states,  \u201cThe  woman  is  a shepherd in her husband\u2019s home and is responsible for her flock,\u201d it is a tremendous task and an enormous trust that has been placed on the Muslim woman, and which contains what it contains of great reward and recompense if she fulfills what is obligatory upon her with respect to her flock, which are her children.

Among that which is reported from \u2018Ali Ibn al-Husayn r is that he would teach his child, telling him, \u201cSay, \u2018I believe in Allah and disbelieve in taghut\u2019\u201d (Reported by Ibn Abi Shaybah). Likewise, the mother should teach her child the three principles: \u201cWho is your lord?\u201d \u201cWhat is your religion?\u201d and \u201cWho is your prophet?\u201d Likewise, she should ask the child, \u201cWhere is Allah?\u201d and \u201cWhat is the Quran?\u201d and other such questions which establish the foundation for a sound \u2018aqidah and pure tawhid within the child.\nAnd among the most beautiful things that a child can  learn  is  that  Allah  c  is  with  His  slave.  So  he learns to fear Allah \uf062, internally venerates the affair of his Creator, and perceives that He is watching him in secret and in public.\nAnd here you have \u2018Abdullah at-Tustari r who, as a child, would repeatedly utter before sleeping, \u201cAllah witnesses me, Allah sees me, Allah is with me\u201d (Reported by Ibn Abi Shaybah).\nThe Mother\u2019s Uprightness Is Reason for Her Chil-\ndren\u2019s Reform\nIt is upon the model, educating mother to reform herself so that she can succeed in reforming her children in her home, for indeed the uprightness of the flock is connected to the uprightness of the shepherd, and the uprightness of the children is connected to the uprightness of the mother.\nIbn Abid-Dunya narrated that \u2018Atabah Ibn Abi Sufyan  said  to  his  son\u2019s  instructor,  \u201cO  Abu  \u2018Abdis-Samad,  let  your  first  means  of  reforming  my  children be that you reform yourself, for indeed their deficiencies will be tied to your deficiency.

Allah \uf062 states upon the tongue of the believer from among the family of Fir\u2019awn, \u201cO my people, this worldly life is only [temporary] enjoyment, and indeed,  the  Hereafter  \u2013  that  is  the  home  of  permanent settlement\u201d (Ghafir 39).

She should teach them the meaning of zuhd and the fact that the blessings which  they  enjoy  are  transient,  and  there\u2019s  nothing better  in  this  regard  than  the  sirah  of  the  Prophet g, the imam of all ascetics. \u2018Urwah narrated saying, \u201c\u2018Aishah \uf069 said, \u2018We would see one crescent moon, and then another, and then another \u2013 three crescents in two months \u2013 and no fire would have been lit in the houses of Allah\u2019s Messenger g!\u2019 I said, \u2018O my aunt, what was it that used to sustain you?\u2019 She said, \u2018The two black things \u2013 dates and water.

In narrating his story \u2013 as reported in Sahih al-Bukhari \u2013 Ka\u2019b \uf068 said, \u201cThe Prophet g forbade the Muslims from speaking to the three of us specifically from among those who had remained behind, so we avoided the people, and they changed their attitude towards us to the extent that it was as if the land had changed and was no longer the one I recognized. We remained that way for fifty nights. As for my two companions, they gave up and \nremained in their homes, weeping, and as for me, I was the youngest and strongest of them, so I would go out and attend the prayer with the Muslims, and I would walk around in the markets and no one would speak to me. I would come to Allah\u2019s Messenger g and give him salam while he was sitting in his gathering after the prayer, and I would say to myself, \u2018Did he move his lips responding to my salam or not?\u2019 Then I would pray near him and would steal a glance at him. When I was busy with my prayer he would turn to me, and when I turned towards him he would turn away  from  me.  When  the  people\u2019s  harshness  lasted long, I went walking and then scaled the wall of Abu Qatadah, who was my cousin and the most beloved person to me. I gave him salam, but by Allah he did not return the salam. So I said, \u2018O Abu Qatadah, I ask you by Allah, do you know that I love Allah and His Messenger?\u2019 But he was silent. So I repeated it to him and asked him by Allah, but he was silent. So I repeated it to him and asked him by Allah, and he said, \u2018Allah and His Messenger know best,\u2019 so my eyes filled with tears.\u201d\nHe remained in this state, with the Muslims boycotting him, until Allah turned to him and his brothers in forgiveness. So reflect, O bondwoman of Allah, and look how the Muslims boycotted Ka\u2019b in response to the command of their prophet and out of their allegiance  to  him!  And  did  Ka\u2019b  \uf068  do  what  is  done by those who remain behind today? Never! For with respect  to  those  who  remain  behind  today,  it  isn\u2019t \n\f", "schema:headline": "The Safe Zone", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "17"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5-The-Syrian-Sahwat:-Shallow-Unity-and-Reliance-on-Taghut", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "5", "schema:articleBody": "Indeed, Allah \uf063 has divided the word of the Syrian Sahwat, scattered their hearts in disunity, ignited discord among them, and made their hostility against each other, until they began striking one another\u2019s necks. That was  after  they  turned  away  from  what  was  obligated upon them by Allah\u2019s saying, \u201cHold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 103), including the tawhid of Allah in His rule and  uniting  under  a  single  imam  who  establishes  the Shari\u2019ah through them and wages war against the kafir parties resisting the Shari\u2019ah.\nWhen some of the Syrian Sahwat realized that their situation  would  end  up  like  that  of  the  Iraqi  Sahwat, ending  up  being  struck  with  humiliation  and  misery, they spread the news of their endeavor to form a jahili, superficial union, in which they will curse one another for the sake of their personal and factional interests. It is as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cYou consider them united, but their hearts are divided. That is because they are a people who do not comprehend\u201d (Al-Hashr 14).\nThis division is the reaping of what they sowed, as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cFrom those who say, \u2018We are Christians,\u2019 We  took  their  covenant;  but  they  forgot  a  portion  of what they were reminded. So We caused among them animosity  and  hatred  until  the  Day  of  Resurrection. And Allah is going to inform them about what they used to do\u201d (Al-Maidah 14). Allah \uf063 also said, \u201cThe Jews say, \u2018The hand of Allah is chained.\u2019 Chained are their hands, and cursed are they for what they say. Rather, both His hands are extended; He spends however He wills. And that which has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and dis-\nbelief.  And  We  have  cast  among  them  animosity  and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war [against you], Allah extinguished it. And they strive to spread corruption throughout the land, and Allah does not like the corrupters\u201d (Al-Maidah 64).\nThus,  regardless  of  how  much  they  endeavor  to unite, and no matter how many new formations they proclaim, their mirage-unity will vanish. \u201cThe example of those who take allies other than Allah is like that of the spider who takes a home. And indeed, the weakest of homes is the home of the spider, if they only knew\u201d (Al-\u2018Ankabut 41). Their alliances with one another for the sake of other than Allah, and their holding tightly to other than His rope, as well as their fighting for other than His cause, all make them too frail to preserve a  single  banner  to  rally  under  or  to  secure  a  state  for themselves, especially after they claimed Islam and then apostatized therefrom by having wala to the Crusaders and the murtaddin in the fight against those who established Allah\u2019s law on the earth.\nHave  the  leaders  of  the  apostate  Sahwat  not  realized and learned that the unity to which they have been called is unity by the religion of Islam and the Muslim Jama\u2019ah, not by the methodologies of nationalism and partisanship?  However,  they  know  nothing  but  desire and taqlid. So if any of the \u201cscholars\u201d of the tawaghit and the \u201ctheorists\u201d of the Sahwat achieve their desires, they blindly follow them, and they throw the words of those who do not achieve their desires against the wall. As for following what Allah has revealed, as He ordered in His statement, \u201cFollow what has been revealed to you \nForeword\fIshaq, and Abu Thawr\u201d (Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari).\nThis was demonstrated in the Sirah of the Prophet \uf067, who killed female participants in the war against Islam. Bunanah, the Jewish wife of al-Hakam al-Quradhi, killed the companion Khallad Ibn Suwayd on the Day of Bani Quraydhah. The Prophet \uf067 called for her and then had her neck struck in retaliation for the blood of Khallad (Tarikh at-Tabari). Likewise, on the Day of al-Fath, the Prophet \uf067 ordered that the two songstresses of Ibn Khatal be killed along with their master. This was because they would sing poetry in support of the kuffar against Allah\u2019s Messenger (Sirat Ibn Hisham), showing that participation in hostile war is not limited to physical combat, but includes any major show of support therein.As for kafir women and children who do not fight or otherwise partake in hostilities, then the principle stands that they should not be deliberately killed, meaning that one should not single them out for targeting. However, when they are not distinctly isolated from the kafir men or when they are not easily distinguishable from them, then their collateral killing is a justified part of the jihad against the kuffar, especially as both the modes of attack and the types of weaponry executed and utilized by the Prophet \uf067 and his followers have necessitated such.\nWith this in mind, the best practice when conducting raids is to start during the night or at the break of dawn, before the sun rises, while the enemy is asleep. At such a time, it is very likely to enter buildings where no light shines and an adult male is not easily distinguishable from women and children. Indeed, it is from the Sunnah of Allah to attack His enemies while they are asleep, whether at night or during the day. Allah said, \u201cHow many villages have We destroyed, as Our might came to them overnight or while they took a midday sleep\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 4).\nSuch was the conduct of the Sahabah even during the life of the Prophet \uf067. As-Sa\u2019b Ibn Jaththamah \uf068 said, \u201cThe Prophet \uf067 passed by me at Abwa or Waddan. He was asked about the people of an area who were raided at night, with their women and children being killed and wounded. He said, \u2018They are from them\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nAl-Khattabi said, \u201cHis saying, \u2018they are from them,\u2019 means in regards to their hukm in the religion. So the son of a kafir is ruled as being a kafir as well. He did not mean by this statement that the children\u2019s blood is lawful to spill deliberately\u2026 But if they are killed or wounded due to them being intermingled with the men, then there is nothing wrong with killing them. Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 had prohibited the killing of women and children, if doing so was done deliberately and they were isolated from the adult males\u201d (A\u2019lam al-Hadith).\nAt-Tahawi said, \u201cSince Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 did not forbid them from making raids, even though they were killing and wounding women and children whom it was forbidden to kill deliberately, it proves that what is allowed based upon this report has a different meaning than that which the first report forbids. That is, the first report prohibits deliberately seeking to kill women and children, while it is allowed to deliberately seek killing the mushrik men, even if that means killing others whom it has been forbidden to deliberately kill\u201d (Sharh Ma\u2019ani al-Athar).\n2   This includes rallying, lobbying, propagandizing, voting, and fundraising for the war on Islam.\nRegarding the ruling on killing women and children of the kuffar, ash-Shafi\u2019i said, \u201cThe Prophet \uf067 only prohibited deliberately killing them, on an individual basis, while their location is known.3 If it is asked what proves this, it is said that his own raids and his command to perform raids proves this. As those who raid the enemy cannot avoid striking the women and children. And his saying, \u2018they are from them,\u2019 means that there is no kaffarah [expiation] for killing them. They are not protected by Islam or by a covenant, and there is no disagreement between Muslims \u2013 as far as I know \u2013 that whoever maims them during a raid, then there is no kaffarah upon him\u201d (Al-Umm).Furthermore, in the first century of the Hijrah, even during the life of the Prophet \uf067 himself, the use of catapults was common in siege warfare. Certainly, catapults \u2013 much like most missiles and explosives of today \u2013 do not distinguish between those whom they maim. Even though the intended target might be the enemy\u2019s men, cities, or barracks walls, the undeniably known result of using a catapult is destruction over a particular radius. All those who happen to be in that radius are not spared the effects of this weapon\u2019s impact. The scholars of the Sirah mentioned that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 first used catapults when attacking the town of Taif near Makkah (Sirat Ibn Hisham). \u2018Amr Ibn al-\u2018As \uf068 likewise used catapults when attacking the city of Alexandria in Egypt (Ibn Qudamah: Al-Mughni).\nLastly, one should not grieve over the collateral killing of kafir women and children, for Allah \uf063 said, \u201cDo not grieve over the disbelieving people\u201d (Al-Maidah 68). Instead, he should realize that Allah, the Lord of creation, had decreed their deaths by His exact justice and great wisdom.4 Moreover, in the hadith of as-Sa\u2019b \uf068, the Prophet \uf067 showed no remorse whatsoever for their collateral deaths nor did he censure the least bit those responsible for their killings in the raid. Accordingly, one should not avoid targeting gatherings of the kuffar \u2013 whether military or civilian \u2013 in which kafir women and children outnumber the kafir men. Rather, the mujahid must strive his utmost to do whatever is permissibly possible to further Allah\u2019s cause, irrespective of the collateral carnage produced thereby amid the kafir masses.5\nMay Allah \uf063 bless the knights of the Khilafah lurking in the Crusader homelands and enable them to carry out massacres against the cross-worshiping populations therein. Amin.\n3   Meaning when they are isolated and distinguished from the men, as he explained elsewhere that the Prophet \uf067 prohibited \u201cdeliberately killing them while they are distinguished and isolated from those he ordered to be killed\u201d (Ar-Risalah).\n4   One should also recall that the kuffar have killed far more Muslim women and children. However, even if the kuffar were to have never killed a single Muslim woman or child, it would still be permissible to target the kafir masses regardless of the collateral killing of kafir women and children caused thereby, as proven by the hadith reported from as-Sa\u2019b \uf068.\n5   The blessed Nice attack in France is an excellent example of the collateral carnage wreaked during the course of jihad. The mujahid Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel \uf08a did not allow the flimsy objections of the palace \u201cscholars\u201d and effeminate \u201creformers\u201d to sway his resolve and instead, relied upon Allah \uf063, followed the Sunnah of the Prophet \uf067 (as reported in the hadith from as-Sa\u2019b \uf068), and advanced upon the hordes of Christian filth, until he achieved martyrdom, after killing dozens of Crusader citizens and wounding multitudes more. May Allah accept him and all those who follow him in good.

At the start of the campaign, the mujahidin in the wilayah began by wearing down the Crusader force, at times by defending against their attacks, at times by counterattacking,  and  at  times  by  striking  the  enemy deep in their territory and by setting up ambushes inside their territory or in areas the kuffar were expected to enter. These operations had a significant effect on the kafir and murtadd troops, whose legions began displaying anxiety, confusion, and fear, and whose hearts were filled with terror.\nAmong the most successful means of defense against the murtaddin\u2019s advance was to booby-trap the places where  they  were  likely  to  advance,  particularly  any strategic locations, and places where the enemy wanted to give the impression of having obtained a victory. Also among  the  means  employed  was  the  distribution  of sniper units using various types of weapons \u2013 including both large-caliber and small-caliber snipers \u2013 throughout strategic locations where the enemy was exposed, as well as in high places, such as buildings.\nWe also employed explosive vehicles, which attacked the gatherings and vehicles of the kuffar that could not be reached with any other weapons, such as projectiles.

So what is the status of these ten days? And what is their virtue? What are the most important acts of worship undertaken in these days?\nIt is sufficient, in clarifying the virtue of these majestic days, that Allah \uf064 swore by them with His words, \u201cBy the dawn, and [by] ten nights\u201d (Al-Fajr 1-2). Ibn Kathir said, \u201cWhat is meant by the ten nights is the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, as stated by Ibn \u2018Abbas, az-Zubayr, Mujahid, and multiple others from the salaf and khalaf,\u201d and Allah \uf063 does not swear except by something significant! Ibnul-Qayyim said, \u201cA period of time that encompasses deeds such as this is worthy of the Lord \uf062 swearing by it\u201d (At-Tibyan).\nFurthermore,  the  Prophet  \uf067  clarified that the first ten days of the month of Dhul-Hijjah are better than all the days  in  this  world,  and  that  a  good deed done in these days is better than all  deeds  done  in  other  days.  He  \uf067 said, \u201cNo deed is better than the deeds in these days (i.e. the ten days of DhulHijjah).\u201d They said, \u201cNot even jihad?\u201d He said, \u201cNot even jihad, except a man who risks his soul and wealth and returns  with  nothing\u201d  (Reported  by  alBukhari from Ibn \u2018Abbas).\nIbn Rajab al-Hanbali said, \u201cThis hadith indicates that a deed in these days [meaning the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah] is more beloved to Allah than a deed in all other days of the world without any exception, and if it is more beloved to Allah then it is better according to Him\u201d (Lataif al-Ma\u2019arif). Ibnul-Qayy-\n\fclear and established. But Allah did not only command the \u201cfighting\u201d of disbelievers, as if to say He only wants us to conduct frontline operations against them. Rather, He has also ordered that they be slain wherever they may be \u2013 on or off the battlefield. He \uf063 said, \u201cSo when the sacred months have  passed,  then  kill  the  mushrikin  wherever  you  find them and take them, surround them, and wait for them at every outpost\u201d (At-Tawbah 5). All of this becomes all the more apparent for those who have realized that the blood of a kafir is cheap, filthy, and permissible to shed.\nIslam  is  the  religion  of  sound  principles  providing  the perfect  foundations  upon  which  the  solid  structures  of justice and glory are built. One of these great principles is that all people must be fought until they accept Islam or come under a shar\u2019i covenant. This principle establishes the prohibition of shedding Muslim and covenant-bound kafir blood as well as the permissibility of shedding the blood of all other kuffar. The Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cI have been ordered to fight mankind until they say that there is no god except Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah, and they establish the prayer and pay the zakah. Whoever does so, then his blood and wealth are safe from me except for a lawful reason\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar), and he \uf067 said, addressing the Muslims, \u201cFor verily your blood, wealth, and honor are haram to each other\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Bakrah). And regarding the dhimmi \u2013 the one who has a covenant with the Muslims \u2013the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever kills a person of covenant shall not smell the fragrance of Jannah, which can be found for a distance of forty years\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from \u2018Abdullah Ibn \u2018Amr). These narrations offer an explanation of the ayah, \u201cAnd do not kill a soul which Allah has forbidden except for a lawful reason\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 151), about which at-Tabari said, \u201cThe soul which Allah has forbidden is the soul of a believer or a person of covenant, and His saying, \u2018except for a lawful reason,\u2019 means that which permits such a soul to be killed, as in capital punishment for murder, or stoning an adulterer to death, or killing someone for apostasy.\u201d\nAs for all others \u2013 meaning all disbelievers who have no covenant \u2013 then their blood has not been given the sanctity of prohibition, but remains under the command to fight mankind, so their blood remains halal. Shedding the blood of a non-dhimmi kafir is not sinful, but is rather rewarded with Jannah. Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cA kafir and his killer will never be gathered together in the Fire\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah). Furthermore, his words, \u201cI have been ordered to fight mankind,\u201d leave no room for debate, as mankind includes every person in the world, and the only ones excluded from this order to fight are those who submit or surrender to the rule of Islam, as was previously mentioned. This alone befits a messenger who was sent to all people, as Allah \uf062 said, \u201cSay, \u2018O mankind, verily I am the Messenger of Allah sent to all of you\u2019\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 158), and the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cOther prophets were sent to their people alone, but I was sent to all of mankind\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Jabir Ibn \u2018Abdillah).\nLest  someone  think  this  is  a  strange,  new  opinion,  it should be known that this is the stance of the Sahabah and the greatest scholars of the Ummah. This is reflected in the words of \u2018Umar Ibn al-Khattab who, during the life of the Prophet \uf067 and without objection, said to Abu Jandal, encouraging him to kill his father Suhayl Ibn \u2018Amr, \u201cBe patient, Abu Jandal, for they are merely mushrikin, and their blood is nothing but (like) the blood of a dog\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from al-Miswar Ibn Makhramah). Indeed, \u2018Umar was correct, as the mushrikin are entirely impure, as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cO you who believe! The mushrikin are nothing but impure\u201d (At-Tawbah 28).\nThis  is  also  understood  from  the  words  of  Anas  Ibn Malik, who was asked, \u201cO Abu Hamzah! What makes a slave\u2019s (i.e. a person\u2019s) blood and wealth haram?\u201d He replied, \u201cWhoever testifies that there is no god but Allah, faces our qiblah, prays our prayer, and eats what we slaughter, then he is a Muslim. He gets what a Muslim gets and is bound by what a Muslim is bound\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Maymum Ibn Siyah).\nAsh-Shafi\u2019i said, \u201cAnd the kafir\u2019s blood is not spared until he becomes a Muslim\u201d (Al-Umm). In further explanation, he  said,  \u201cAllah  spared  blood  and  restricted  the  taking  of wealth, except for a lawful reason, through belief in Allah and in His Messenger or through a covenant given by the believers, based on the rule of Allah and His Messenger, to the People of the Book. And He allowed shedding the blood of mature men who refrain from belief and who do not have a covenant. Allah \uf066 said, \u2018So when the sacred months have passed, then kill the mushrikin wherever you find them and take them, surround them, and wait for them at every outpost\u2019  (At-Tawbah  5)\u201d  (Al-Umm).  Mentioning  the  exception of killing women and children, he also said, \u201cAnd the reason for the prohibition of shedding Muslim blood being different from the prohibition of shedding the kafir child\u2019s and kafir woman\u2019s blood is that they are not to be killed due to specific revelation restricting this killing [while the initial ruling allows shedding kafir blood in general]. And our opinion regarding this \u2013 and Allah knows best \u2013 is that the restriction exists so that they can become slaves, which is more beneficial than killing them, and killing them does not harm the enemy; so making them slaves is more optimal than killing them\u201d (Al-Umm).\nAl-Khattabi said, \u201cThe kafir\u2019s blood is permissible because he has not yet uttered the word of tawhid; but if he were to say it, then his blood is spared and becomes prohibited\u201d (A\u2019lam al-Hadith).\nIbn  Hazm,  after  mentioning  the  prohibition  of  targeting women and children, said, \u201cAnd it is permissible to kill anyone \u2013 other than those we mentioned above \u2013 of the mushrikin,  both  the  combatant  and  non-combatant,  the businessman and employee, the elderly man \u2013 whether or not he be a person of influence \u2013 the farmer, the bishop or priest or monk, the blind or crippled \u2013 no one is given exception\u201d  (Al-Muhalla).\n\f", "schema:headline": "The Virtue of the 10 Days of Dhul-Hijjah and the Acts of Worship Therein", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "30"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah11-Our-Journey-to-Allah", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "The  time  has  come  to  distinguish  and  separate the truthful from the liar, the righteous from the wicked, the believer from the hypocrite, and those  who  are  steadfast  and  unshakable  from those  who  despair  and  lose  hope;  to  separate those who truly desire Jannah from deep within their hearts from those who only make the claim on the tip of their tongues.

Then,  when  the  ahzab came in the year of the [battle of the] trench and they saw them, they said, \u2018This is what Allah and His Messenger  had  promised  us,  and  Allah and  His  Messenger spoke the truth,\u2019 and they  knew  that  Allah  had  tried  them with  being  shaken, and  that  there  had come  to  them  the likes  of  what  had come  to  those  who had passed on before them. And it did not increase them except in  faith  and  in  acceptance  of  Allah\u2019s judgment  and  command.  And  this  is the condition of the truthful  Muslims today,  just  as  it  has been the condition of the truthful Muslims in every era. Indeed, these trials \u2013 through which the Muslims in the Khilafah State have been afflicted, with these corrupting disbelievers who are attacking the shari\u2019ah of Islam \u2013 have a similar precedent in the era of Allah\u2019s  Messenger  g  through  which  Allah  tried  His Prophet and the believers, and on account of which He \uf063 revealed clear surahs and ayat, and the books of the Sunnah are abound with the mention of many of these events. Imam Ibn Taymiyyah said, \u201cIndeed, the texts of the Book and the Sunnah which represent the call of Muhammad g encompass all of mankind, and Allah\u2019s covenants in His Book and in the sunnah of His Messenger encompass the last of this ummah just as they encompassed the first of this ummah. And Allah only narrated to us the stories of those nations that came before us so that they would serve as a lesson for us, such that we would compare our condition to theirs and measure the last of the nations in accordance  with  the  first  of  them,  and  thus  the  believer from  among  the  latecomers  would  have  something resembling what the believers from among the predecessors had.\u201d This marks the end of his words.\nTHE RAFIDAH HAVE RALLIED AGAINST US UNDER THE BANNER OF THE CRUSADERS\nsight. But Allah supports with His victory whom He wills. Indeed in that is a lesson for those of vision\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 13). He also told us of their besieging of Bani an-Nadir, saying, \u201cIt is He who expelled the ones who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture from their homes at the first gathering. You did not think they would leave, and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allah; but [the decree of] Allah came upon them from where they had not expected, and He cast terror into their hearts [so] they destroyed their houses by their [own] hands and the hands of the believers. So take warning, O people of vision\u201d (Al-Hashr 2). So He commanded us to take a lesson from the conditions of those who\u2019ve preceded us in this nation as well as those nations came before us. He \uf065 then mentioned in more than one place in His Book that His sunnah concerning the nations is a sunnah that remains consistent and continuous. He \uf063 said, \u201cAnd if those who disbelieve had fought you, they would have turned their backs [in flight]. Then they would not find a protector or a helper. [This is] the established way of Allah which has occurred before.

Raqqah was the base from which the Islamic State expanded, and the center for the Khilafah\u2019s operations  on  the  various  fronts.

Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet  g  said,  \u201cDo  not  prevent  the female slaves of Allah from the masajid of Allah, and [when they go to the masjid] let them go without putting on perfume\u201d (Reported by Abu Dawud). Imam Muslim r reported in the hadith of Zaynab, the wife of \u2018Abdullah Ibn Mas\u2019ud \uf069, that she said, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger g told us, \u2018If one of you [women] attends the masjid, let her not touch any perfume.\u201d\nMusa  Ibn  Yasar  narrated,  saying,  \u201cA  woman  passed by Abu Hurayrah and her scent was wafting, so he said, \u2018Where are you going, O female slave of Al-Jabbar (the AllPowerful)?\u2019 She said, \u2018To the masjid.\u2019 He said, \u2018And you put on perfume?\u2019 She said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 So he said, \u2018Go back and take a bath, for indeed I heard the Prophet g say, \u2018Allah will not accept any prayer from a woman who goes to the masjid with her perfume wafting until she goes back and takes a bath\u2019 (Reported by Ibn Khuzaymah, and by al-Bayhaqi in al-Adab). And in general, a woman wearing perfume when she leaves her house is prohibited regardless of whether she is going to the masjid or elsewhere, and it is not permissible for anyone to smell the fragrance of a woman other than her husband and her maharim (near-relatives).\nAnd on her way to the masjid, the woman must avoid walking in the middle of the path and should instead stick to the sides of the path. Hamzah Ibn Abi Usayd al-Ansari reported that his father narrated that Allah\u2019s Messenger g came out of the masjid and the men had mixed with the women on the road, so he said to the women, \u201cRemain back, as it is not for you [women] to dominate the road. Stay on the sides of the path.\u201d So the women would walk adjacent to the wall, so much so that their garments would get caught on the wall due to them walking so closely to it (Reported by Abu Dawud and at-Tabarani).\nThe Sunan and Etiquettes of Entering the Masjid\nAs for when a woman enters the masjid, it is legislated for  her  to  pray  two  rak\u2019at  before  sitting  down.  Abu \nA WOMAN\u2019S PRAYER IN HER HOME IS BETTER THAN HER PRAYER IN THE MASJID\nQatadah \uf068 said, \u201cThe Prophet g said, \u2018When one of you enters the masjid, let him not sit down until he has prayed two rak\u2019at\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim). And if the woman enters the masjid and the iqamah has already been called, there is no prayer at that point other than the obligatory prayer. Abu Hurayrah \uf068 narrated that the Prophet g said, \u201cWhen the iqamah is called, there is no prayer other than the obligatory prayer\u201d (Reported by Muslim).\nIt is upon the Muslimah to seek out the last of the women\u2019s  rows  for  prayer,  for  Abu  Hurayrah  \uf068  said, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger g said, \u2018The best row for the men is the first row and the worst is the last row, and the best row for the women is the last row and the worst is the first  row\u2019\u201d  (Reported  by  Muslim).  So  we  find  that  the Legislator takes the utmost concern to distance her from the men, and prevents her from mixing with them even in the houses of Allah, which have not been established except  for  obedience  and  worship.\nAnd  from  the  Sunnah  is  that  the  woman  claps  her hands if something happens to her during her prayer. Abu Hurayrah \uf068 narrated that the Prophet g said, \u201cTasbih (saying \u2018subhanallah\u2019) is for the men and clapping is for the women\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nAs  for  the  manner  of  clapping,  the  fuqaha  have  a difference of opinion on it. Some of them said that the woman claps the palms of her hands, and some of them said that she claps the palm of one hand using the back of the other hand, and some of them said that she claps the palm of her left hand using two of the fingers on her right hand.\nHowever, if there are no men present, there is no harm in  a  woman  making  tasbih,  as  was  done  by  UmmulMuminin  \u2018Aishah  with  her  sister  Asma  \uf069  during  the kusuf (eclipse) prayer, as the only thing to beware of is making tasbih in the presence of men due to the fear that \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "It Will Be a Fire That Burns the Cross and Its People in Raqqah", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "31"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah10-Military-and-Covert-Operations", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "As the soldiers of the Khilafah continue waging war on the forces of kufr, we take a glimpse at a number of recent  operations  conducted  by  the  mujahidin  of  the Islamic State that have succeeded in expanding the territory of the Khilafah, or terrorizing, massacring, and humiliating the enemies of Allah.

He also gives glad tidings that many muhajirin from various regions have reached them and joined their ranks.\nRumiyah  Magazine  presents  here  its  interview with Shaykh Abu \u2018Abdillah al-Muhajir, the amir of the soldiers of the Khilafah in East Asia.\nQuestion:  Assalamu  \u2018alaykum  wa  rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.

May  blessings  and  peace  be  upon Allah\u2019s  trustworthy  Messenger,  and  upon  his  family, his companions, and those who follow them in righteousness until the Day of Judgment. As for what follows:\nThe condition of the Muslims in East Asia is like the condition of their  brothers in all the regions of the earth who neither have one jama\u2019ah that brings them together, nor an imam who leads them. They were groups, parties, tribes, and organizations who were scattered and divided, and the mushrikin benefited from this tremendously.\nWith the spread of Christianity on a large scale in this region under the sword of Crusader colonialism and with support from it, and with this continuing until the current period, wiping out Islam in this region was among the most important declared goals of the mushrikin. They attempted to place pressure on the Muslims using every means in order to change their religion and remove them from the land, and this is what gave birth to a good reaction, such that the  people  awoke  from  their  slumber  and  carried weapons  against  the  Crusader  government  and  its criminal  military.\nAnd this was what stunned the mushrikin, especially in the midst of their inability to subdue those attributing  themselves  to  Islam  and  their  inability to  subjugate  them  once  more.  So  they  were  forced to stop their shedding of blood and bring their aggression against their areas to a halt, and their greatest  dream  became  making  them  sit  back  and  not fight. But how far that is! For despite the crimes of the Crusaders, and the betrayal and treachery of the treacherous, the people continue to keep hold of their weapons, ready to fight the Christians at any time.And in this environment of enmity between the people of tawhid and the people of shirk, a new generation of youth was brought up. They learned tawhid, knew  wala  and  bara,  and  placed  before  themselves the goal of establishing Allah\u2019s rule in the land in this region which had become a thorn in the throats of the belligerent Christians, the pagan Buddhists, and all the other religions of shirk. But the large number of parties and banners, and the multitude of leaders steering  the  people  from  one  form  of  misguidance to another distanced the people from achieving their lofty  goals,  and  even  plunged  many  of  them  into shirk  and  apostasy  with  their  treading  of  the  path of the murtadd brotherhood, their entrance into democracy, and their allying with the mushrikin.\nHowever, a group of muwahhidin remained, concerned with not allowing the rule in this land to be except for Allah c. These were the vanguard among those who gave bay\u2019ah to Amirul-Muminin \uf085 and joined the Islamic State \u2013 may Allah bless it for us.\nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Military and Covert Operations", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "31"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah8-The-Kafir's-Wealth-Is-Halal-for-You,-so-Take-It", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "12Exclusive\n\fOur  Prophet  g  was the  leader  of  the  devout worshipers  and  the  zuhhad (ascetics).

He detonated his vehicle on them, killing and injuring at least 100 murtaddin and destroying dozens \nof vehicles.\nOn  the  7th  of  Rajab,  the  istishhadi  Abu  Dharr al-\u2018Iraqi  \uf08a  entered  into  a  memorial  service  held  by the Rafidi Mobilization in the area of Iskandariyyah in Babil and detonated his explosive vest, killing and injuring  dozens  of  them.\nRaqqah Wilayah\nOn  the  4th  of  Rajab,  several  inghimasiyyin  set out towards PKK positions in the eastern and western countryside of the wilayah. The first detachment attacked their positions in three villages in the eastern  countryside  and  succeeded  in  killing  more  than 35  murtaddin.  Another  group,  meanwhile,  attacked the  murtaddin\u2019s  positions  near  the  Tabaqah  airbase and  succeeded  in  killing  30  murtaddin,  in  addition to destroying a bulldozer and four military vehicles, and  taking  a  4-wheel  drive  vehicle  mounted  with  a \nNews\n\f\u2018Umar  (Adel  Kermiche  and  \u2018Abdul  Malik  Petitjean) in  France,  Muhammad  Riyad,  Muhammad  Daleel, and  Abul-Bara  at-Tunisi  (Anis  al-\u2018Amri)  in  Germany,  Abu  Ramadan  al-Muhajir  (Omar  Abdel  Hamid el-Hussein) in Denmark, and others \uf08d have set heroic examples with their operations. With their blood they incited, instructed, and demonstrated practically for other Muslims how one can attain Allah\u2019s pleasure and escape His \uf065 wrath while stationed in the garrisons of the open war arena against the Crusader West.     \nHostage-Taking\nThe objective of hostage-taking in the lands of disbelief \u2013 and specifically in relation to just terror operations \u2013 is not to hold large numbers of the kuffar hostage in order to negotiate one\u2019s demands. Rather, the objective is to create as much carnage and terror as one possibly can until Allah decrees his appointed time and the enemies of Allah storm his location or succeed in killing him. This is because the hostile kafir only  understands  one  language  and  that  is  the  language of force, the language of killing, stabbing and slitting  throats,  chopping  off  heads,  flattening  them under trucks, and burning them alive, \u2018until they give the  jizyah  while  they  are  in  a  state  of  humiliation\u2019 (At-Tawbah  29).\nThis sunnah of inflicting a slaughter upon the kuffar was ordered by Allah \uf062 when He said, \u201cSo when you meet those who disbelieve, strike [their] necks until, when you have inflicted slaughter upon them, then secure their bonds, and either [confer] favor afterwards or ransom [them] until the war lays down its burdens\u201d (Muhammad 4), and likewise in His c statement, \u201cIt is not for a prophet to have captives until he inflicts a massacre in the land. You (i.e. the Muslims) desire the commodities of this world, but Allah desires [for you] the Hereafter. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise\u201d (Al-Anfal 67).\nArmed with a Firearm\nThe scenario for such an attack is that one assaults a busy, public, and enclosed location and rounds up the kuffar  who  are  present.  Having  gained  control  over the victims, one should then proceed to slaughter as many of them as he possibly can before the initial police response, as was outstandingly demonstrated by the mujahidin \uf08d who carried out the Bataclan theatre massacre during the course of the blessed Paris raid in \nwhich the three soldiers of the Khilafah, armed with assault rifles and hand grenades, stormed the theater, taking  up  positions  and  firing  at  the  Crusader  citizens present. After having killed and injured many of them, those remaining of the kuffar were taken hostage so as to slow any efforts of the responding kafir armed forces from storming the theater. The raid was immensely successful, resulting in the harvest of 89 dead Crusader citizens and over 200 wounded. Similarly,  Omar  Mateen  \uf08a  superbly  demonstrated  this scenario when, having armed himself with an assault rifle  and  a  handgun,  he  single-handedly  slaughtered 49 sodomites \u2013 by Allah\u2019s permission \u2013 and wounded 44 others, taking advantage of the slow initial police response and utilizing that window of opportunity to massacre as many of them as he possibly could.\nThe Acquisition of Firearms\nThe acquisition of firearms can be very simple depending on one\u2019s geographical location. For example:The  USA:  In  most  US  states,  anything  from  a single-shot  shotgun  all  the  way  up  to  a  semi-automatic AR-15 rifle can be purchased at showrooms or through online sales \u2013 by way of private dealers \u2013 with no background checks, and without requiring either an ID or a gun license. And with approximately 5,000 gun shows taking place annually within the United States, the acquisition of firearms becomes a very easy matter.\nEurope:  Due  to  its  proximity  to  many  conflict zones,  such  as  Ukraine,  Russia,  Turkey,  and  Sham, and due to its inability to control its porous borders, firearms  are  widely  available  in  Europe,  facilitating their  acquisition  by  means  of  gun  dealers  and  underground  criminal  networks  \u2013  for  those  capable  of attaining  those  connections  \u2013  which  are  widespread and  rampant  throughout  Europe.  This  was  clearly demonstrated by the brother Abu Basir al-Ifriqi (Amedy Coulibaly) \uf08a, who succeeded in acquiring a small arsenal of weapons consisting of handguns, AK-47 assault rifles, explosives, and a cache of ammunition.The UK: Much like its Crusader European counterparts, the UK faces a gun control dilemma as it feebly attempts to fend off the influx of weapons, but to no  avail.  Guns  are  readily  available  for  purchase  on the streets of Britain, even if not to the extent of their availability  on  the  streets  of  its  Crusader  European partners.\n\f", "schema:headline": "Military and Covert Operations", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "41"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah13", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3-This-Is-What-Allah-and-His-Messenger-Promised-Us", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "3", "schema:articleBody": "With  the  beginning  of  the  modern  crusade against  the  usurped  Muslim  lands,  a  campaign aimed to fortify the rule of taghut therein and to prevent  the  muwahhidin  from  establishing  the religion and implementing the Shari\u2019ah, the Crusaders initiated a corresponding project to replace the religion of the people and to alter the tenets and teachings of Islam, so that it would become harmonious  with  the  jahili  American  vision  for the  world,  which  they  named  the  \u201cNew  World Order.\u201d To actualize this project, they found no better than the Murtadd Brotherhood to be the role model for people to be directed to and to thus follow, if they sought America\u2019s contentment. The Crusaders tested them and realized the corruption of their creed and their allegiance to enemies of the religion, observing the works of the Brotherhood in several lands.\nSince the followers of the Turkish taghut Erbakan  have  been  the  most  disgraceful  school  of the  Murtadd  Brotherhood,  the  most  severely  of them  drenched  in  the  swamp  of  shirk,  and  the most loyal of them to the mushrikin, one of Erbakan\u2019s students decided to enter into this project himself. Indeed, it was none other than the wicked Erdogan, for the student had far surpassed his apostate teacher in following the path of democracy  and  accepting  secularism.  He  was  appointed president, given an aura needed to deceive the fools of mankind, and tasked with overseeing several regional affairs. He had a major role, along with the tawaghit of the Arab nations, in executing the project of the Iraqi Sahwah, which assisted the Crusaders in hiding their embarrassing defeat and helped them establish the foundations of the Rafidi government in Baghdad.\nSince the beginnings of the jihad in Sham, Erdogan and his intelligence apparatuses strived to drag  the  various  militant  factions  into  relation-\n2Foreword\nships  with  him.  Through  him,  they  would  hook  up with  the  Crusader  nations,  which  used  them  to  fight the Islamic State and ordered them to stop fighting the Nusayri regime. Convoys of the militant factions would eventually leave the frontlines against the regime and, with the backing of Erdogan\u2019s army and the financing of his government, head off to fight the muwahhidin.Erdogan and his vile state attempted to keep their war on the Islamic State \u201cunder wraps,\u201d hiding behind the  murtadd  factions  that  were  formed  under  their watchful  eyes  and  nourished  by  their  support  and  financing.  This  was  out  of  fear  that  the  muwahhidin would turn on Turkey, igniting it in a blazing war that would  not  be  extinguished  until  its  borders  met  the fate  of  other  Sykes-Picot  borders  that  the  mujahidin had removed with their own hands. Then, as the battle intensified between the Islamic State and the Crusader coalition  and  its  murtadd  troops,  the Turkish  taghut revealed his prepared role and chartered mission, so he opened the airspace of his country for Crusader warplanes, opened its borders to supply the PKK atheists in \u2018Ayn al-Islam, and opened its armories for the Sahwah apostates in Aleppo. And when more was requested of him, he responded loyally, entangling his army in the battlefield against the soldiers of the Khilafah, sending \nArticle\fportion was like a great towering mountain. And We advanced the pursuers thereto. And We saved Moses and those with him, all together. Then We drowned the others. Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers. And indeed, your Lord \u2013 He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful\u201d (Ash-Shu\u2019ara 53-68).\nAllah \uf063 also said, \u201cWhen the messengers despaired and were certain that they had been denied, there came to them Our victory, and whoever We willed was saved. And Our punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are criminals\u201d (Yusuf 110).\nO slaves of Allah, indeed, faith will not be complete in the soul of the Jama\u2019ah of the Muslims until the Jama\u2019ah is exposed to \u2013 and makes preparations for \u2013 jihad against mankind over the matter of this faith and confronting the people of falsehood with all their strength, while  exposing  itself  in  that  jihad  and  struggle  to  the hammers of tribulation and the bitterness of hardship, being patient in both victory and defeat, and being shaken and afflicted with fear. Then it remains firm and does not doubt, remains upright and does not bend, and persists upon the rightly guided path of its faith, inshaallah. And if not for these parties and this jihad, faith would have weakened and not increased, the hearts would have become  corrupt  and  not  upright,  and  we  would  have seen  the  people\u2019s  souls  becoming  stagnant,  ambitions sagging,  and  faith  shriveling,  and  this  is  how  the  situation becomes when we are afflicted with luxury. \u201cIf it were not for Allah checking [some] people by means of others, the earth would have been corrupted, but Allah is full of bounty to the creation\u201d (Al-Baqarah 251).\nIndeed, the enemies of Allah \u2013 the Jews, Christians, atheists, Rafidah, apostates, and all the nations of disbelief \u2013 dedicated their media, wealth, armies, and vehicles to wage war against the Muslims and the mujahidin in Ninawa Wilayah after seeing it as one of the bases and beacons  of  Islam  in  the  shade  of  the  Khilafah.  Seeing the  Muslims  living  in  honor  and  security  therein  deprived them of sleep, and they were burdened by seeing an example of Islamic rule being realized for the people, one that they could see and live, whose shade they could seek, and whose goodness and blessing they could enjoy. And this is what they fear most, because it is the path to spreading the authority of Islam and expanding its territory, and the path to having the people enter it.\nTherefore,  O  people  of  Ninawa  in  general,  and  O mujahidin in particular, fear Allah, fear Allah concerning the religion of Allah. Beware of becoming weak in waging jihad against your enemy and repelling them, for indeed, this will undo the bonds of Islam and extinguish the light of truth.\nO  muhajirin  and  ansar,  proceed  forward  with  your foresight and be patient upon what you have resolved. Be patient with the bitterness, for it is as if the Ummah\u2019s division will be healed soon, the word of goodness and justice will be mended shortly, and the truth will repel falsehood, for indeed, there will be another day after this one, and patience brings the best result to all affairs. Allah \uf063 said, \u201c[Their] assembly will be defeated, and they will turn their backs [in retreat]\u201d (Al-Qamar 45). Allah \n\uf065 also said, \u201cYou wished that the unarmed party would be yours [to engage]. But Allah intended to establish the truth  by  His  words  and  to  eliminate  the  disbelievers, that He should establish the truth and abolish falsehood, even if the criminals disliked it\u201d (Al-Anfal 7-8).\nO soldiers of the Khilafah, if you stand before America\u2019s planes and allies, then stand with steadfastness, relying  upon  Him  in  whose  hand  is  the  domain  of  the heavens  and  the  earth,  the  one  before  whom  \u201cthere  is no creature but that He holds its forelock. Indeed, my Lord is on a straight path\u201d (Hud 56). Say, \u201cAllah is sufficient for us and the best disposer of affairs,\u201d for it is a statement Ibrahim said when he was cast into the fire, and which Muhammad \uf067 uttered when the people said to him, \u201cIndeed, the people have gathered against you, so fear them\u201d (Ali \u2018Imran 173), and know that if the sky were to clamp down on the earth, Allah would make an opening for the believers.\nTherefore, O battalions of inghimasiyyin, O caravans of  istishhadiyyin,  and  detachments  of  iqtihamiyyin,  O seekers of shahadah, the best reward, and more than that, O you who strive towards the Gardens and the pleasure of Allah, go forth with Allah\u2019s blessing, for indeed, this war  is  your  war. Turn  the  disbelievers\u2019  night  into  day, bring destruction to their homes, make their blood flow like rivers, for therein you will find the richest share of reward and means for achieving great success, attaining the companionship of those upon whom Allah has bestowed favor:  the  prophets,  the  truthful,  the  martyrs,  and  the righteous. And excellent are those as companions. And let your condition declare, \u201cI hastened to You, my Lord, that You be pleased\u201d (Taha 84). May Allah reward you with good on behalf of Islam and the Muslims. You have made the disbelievers taste horrors and have rubbed their noses in swamps. May we be sacrificed for you. You were, and continue to be \u2013 after Allah \u2013 the best source of support, strength, and aid.\nO Ahlus-Sunnah in Iraq, is it that every single time you show no sense? You tasted humiliation and disgrace to the extent that you grazed on it, and you strayed just as Bani Israil strayed before you. Do you not see the Rafidah, every day, afflicting you with the worst of torment? They  raid  your  lands  under  the  pretext  of  waging  war against  the  Islamic  State,  then  they  don\u2019t  depart  until they\u2019ve  either  killed  your  men  and  taken  your  women and children prisoner or until they\u2019ve driven them out. Do  you  not  see  Iraq  having  its  cities  emptied  of  Ahlus-Sunnah and filled with the most despicable of Allah\u2019s creation and the most evil of those to who have treaded the  earth?  Look  at  their  banners  when  they  fight  you, listen to their slogans when they surround your lands, contemplate their deeds when they expel you from your land, and listen to their cries when they shout with their calls  to  raid  all  the  lands  of  Ahlus-Sunnah,  from  your Iraq to your Sham to your Najd, even to your Yemen.O Ahlus-Sunnah, your rulers in the region have practiced the lowest and most despicable form of treachery history has known, for they sold your issue and surrendered  your  affair  and  your  land  to  your  enemy.

And I fear for those relatives after me, and my wife is barren, so grant for me, from Your bounty, a successor to inherit from me and from the family of Ya\u2019qub \u2013 and make him, my Lord, pleasant [to You and Your slaves]\u201d (Maryam 4-6).

Ibn  Kathir  \uf072  said, \u201cIbn  Jurayj  narrated  that  Mujahid  said,  \u2018This  is  the first  ayah  revealed  of  Surat  Baraah.  Allah  mentions His  favor  upon  them  and  His  generosity  for  them through His supporting them in \u2018many fields\u2019 of their battles alongside Allah\u2019s Messenger g; and that was from Him c and by His empowerment and estimation \u2013 not by their numbers or equipment \u2013 and He reminded them that victory comes from Him alone, whether their numbers are small or many.

Ibnul-Qayyim  \uf072  said,  \u201cSo indeed, being in need of Allah with some deficiency is better than being proud with none\u201d (Tariq al-Hijratayn). Muslim reported from Abu Hurayrah \uf068 that, \u201cNo one was humble to Allah except that He raised him. This raising in the Dunya is through support, victory, and good reputation; and in the Akhirah, it is through high levels and the praiseworthy station.\u201dIbn Battal \uf072 said, \u201c\u2018Aishah said, \u2018Indeed you are heedless  of  the  best  act  of  worship:  humility.\u2019  AtTabari \uf072 said, \u2018Humility is one of the tests by which Allah tests His believing slaves, to see how they will obey Him therein and because He knows the benefit for  His  creation  in  that  \u2013  of  their  dunya  and  their akhirah \u2026 Of that is when he g entered Makkah, the people began saying [in praise], \u2018He is this and he is that.\u2019 So he slumped upon his camel, saying, \u2018Allah is higher and loftier.\u2019\u2019 He then said, \u2018Tariq Ibn Shihab narrated that when \u2018Umar came to Sham, he reached a ford.

And  accustom  your hearts and tongues to His remembrance so that you may be successful \u2026 Qatadah said, \u2018Allah made dhikr an obligation when you are most occupied: during the exchange of clashing swords.\u2019\u201d\nAl-Qurtubi wrote valuable words when giving the tafsir of this ayah. He said, \u201cThe scholars have three opinions about this dhikr. The first is that you must remember Allah when your hearts are worried, for His dhikr assists with steadfastness during hard times. The \n\fin total, among which were 71 tanks, 18 23mm and 57mm cannons, a 14.5mm machine gun, 20 122mm and 130mm cannons, and several 4-wheel drive vehicles mounted with machine guns. This was in addition to the destruction of a Russian helicopter, and all praise is due to Allah.\nQuestion: What were the numbers and positions of the enemy in and around Tadmur prior to the conquest?\nAnswer: The Nusayri regime and those who support  it,  the  Russian  forces  and  the  Rafidi  militias, took  several  positions  as  their  central  points  in  the city and around it. They fortified them greatly, including Mount Tar, the city\u2019s silos, \u2018Amiriyyah Hill, and Mount Huyan, while the area of Jazal was where they set up their military barracks, atop hills overlooking the roads leading to them, also fortifying them. On the side of the Nusayri regime forces, there were Rafidi militias from Iran, Afghanistan, and Iraq, and the so-called  \u201cPopular  Committees,\u201d  as  well  as  Russian forces. The Russian forces, whose numbers were confined to the dozens, were charged with operating support and air cover and training the troops present in the area. The number of Nusayri personnel in the city was between 1500 and 2000, reinforced with dozens of armored vehicles, tanks, and heavy weapons. The Nusayriyyah gathered this force to launch an attack on positions of the mujahidin in Khayr Wilayah.\nThe city was divided based upon the militias stationed  therein.  Each  of  them  occupied  a  street  or building, painting their slogans of shirk and placing their particular flags all around, dominating the area thereby. The Rafidi mushrikin built several Husayniyyat inside the city, and they stole whatever property they  could,  even  water  tanks.  The  city  was  abound with checkpoints, there was a military base specifically for the Russian forces, and the city\u2019s condition in regards to services was extremely bad.\nQuestion: Tell us about the operation to recapture the city of Tadmur. How was it conducted and what were the results of the conquest?\nAnswer: The military operation began on the 8th of Rabi\u2019 al-Awwal. The soldiers of the Khilafah launched a wide scale, surprise attack against the Nusayri army and the Rafidi militias from 8 axes along a frontline that\u2019s approximately 200 kilometers long. They made a major advance \u2013 by Allah\u2019s grace \u2013 and took control of the city of Tadmur, as well as dozens of positions in the surrounding areas, in addition to the oil and gas fields, and vast areas of the eastern Hims countryside in a surprise attack that destroyed the Nusayriyyah\u2019s hopes of advancing on the Tadmur \u2013 Khayr highway with the intent of breaking the mujahidin\u2019s siege on the Nusayriyyah in the city of Khayr and its military airbase. The importance of the city of Tadmur lies in the  fact  that  it\u2019s  a  transportation  hub  that  connects \n\f", "schema:headline": "Paths to Victory: Part 4", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "29"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah13-Table-of-Contents", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "13", "schema:articleBody": "CONTENTS\nI S S U E   1 3   -   D H U L- H I J J A H   1 4 3 8\nO  MUWAHHIDIN,  REJOICE,  FOR  BY ALLAH WE WILL  NOT  REST  FROM  OUR JIHAD EXEPT BENEATH THE OLIVE TREES OF  RUMIYAH  (ROME).ABU HAMZAH AL-MUHAJIR r\n04 FOREWORD\nARTICLES\nOF JAHIIYYAH\nYOU BECOME OCCUPIED\nAND THE EVIDENCE FOR THE OBLIGATION OFESTABLISHING IT\n06 THE RULE OF THE SHARI\u2019AH, NOT THE RULE10 TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR SPARE TIME BEFORE 14 THE POSITION OF IMAMAH IN THE RELIGION22 IMPORTANT ADVICE FOR THE MUJAHIDIN: PART 326 THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MUNAFIQIN: PART 130 THE HIJRAH OF UMM SULAYM AL-MUHAJIRAH\n06\n10\nNEWS\n14\n36 MILITARY AND COVERT OPERATIONS\n\fSpain  experimented  with  this  matter  before, allowing herself to be led by the obeyed fool, Bush, in his invasion of Iraq as she dreamt of the oilfields and the potential revenue from construction. But she found the army that she had sent there at the forefront of  targets being struck by the mujahidin, who  continued  making  them  suffer  until  Spain was  forced  to  withdraw  its  troops  from  Iraq  in humiliation, with her soldiers licking their wounds and her government being cursed by its citizens. It appears,  however,  that  this  lesson  wasn\u2019t  enough for the Crusaders to take heed.\nSo when a later government claimed that it had understood  the  first  lesson  and  resolved  not  to have its army take part in a direct ground war, it made the decision instead to take part in the war against  the  Islamic  State  by  training  the  Rafidi army  and  providing  it  with  extensive  support  in order  to  pay  its  share  of  the  expenses  under  the framework  of  taking  part  in  the  international Crusader coalition established by America in order to fight the Islamic State.\nAnd  just  as  she  had  not  taken  a  lesson  from her prior experiment, she likewise had not taken a lesson from the experiments of the other western Crusader  states  waging  war  against  the  Muslims \u2013 states which are even more powerful than Spain and have better intelligence capabilities and more secure borders, such as Britain, France, Germany, and  America,  and  which  have  all,  nonetheless, faced the wrath of the soldiers of the Islamic State, who rushed forth in response to their leadership\u2019s incitement  to  fight  the  kuffar  in  their  own homelands. So Spain continued in her war against the  Muslims,  believing  herself  to  be  very  distant from what had afflicted her sisters.\nAnd  today,  the  soldiers  of  the  Islamic  State have repeated in multiple lands what their heroic brothers  have  done  in  other  Crusader  states, punishing  the  states  of  Turkey,  Spain,  Russia, Belgium,  and  other  lands  of  the  Crusaders  and murtaddin.\nIn Turkey, a lion of the Islamic State carried out an  attack  on  the  21st  of  Dhul-Qa\u2019dah,  stabbing and  killing  one  of  the  policemen  of  the  taghut, Erdogan, in front of their police station.\nIn  Spain,  a  group  of  Islamic  State  soldiers conducted two operations in two separate cities on the 25th of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah, with the main massacre dealing a blow to the tourism sector \u2013 which makes \nup  the  largest  part  of  Spain\u2019s  economy  \u2013  as  the mujahidin killed 16 and wounded more than 130 others from among the Jews and Crusaders, giving them a new lesson in politics that teaches them the necessity  of  preparing  themselves  to  pay  a  heavy human  and  economic  price  for  their  war  against the Islamic State before calculating the gains that they expect to make in their war.\nIn  Russia,  a  lone  knight  of  the  Islamic  State \uf08a stabbed and wounded 7 people on the 27th of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah, with his brave deed demonstrating that one doesn\u2019t need much in terms of weapons and planning in order to march forth and attack the kuffar.\nAnd in Belgium, a soldier of the Islamic State \uf08a attacked a group of Belgian soldiers on the 3rd of Dhul-Hijjah, stabbing them until he was killed.These are just some of the operations in which the  soldiers  of  the  Islamic  State  have  attacked the  Crusaders,  Jews,  and  murtaddin  in  their own  homelands,  killing  and  wounding large numbers  of  them,  particularly  in  recent  weeks. And  in  following  these  events,  one  can  see  that the  European  Crusader  states  have  not  ceased to  pay  the  heavy  burden  brought  about  by  such blessed  operations  even  after  several  months,  for their  militaries  continue  to  be  deployed  on  their streets, their security measures remain heightened, their  profit  from  trade  and  tourism  continues  to decline, and a state of terror continues to exist, the most obvious signs of which are not the widespread patrols  in  their  public  squares,  nor  the  cement barriers on their streets.\nWith  Allah\u2019s  permission,  the  attacks  in  Spain and in other kafir states will continue as long as they  are  at  war  with  the  Islamic  State,  and  with Allah\u2019s  permission,  they  will  not  be  able  to  stop them regardless of what measures and precautions they take, and they know this very well. And what is anticipated is that the soldiers of the Islamic State will escalate these attacks to a greater level in the coming  period.  So  let  the  Crusader  governments prepare themselves for an increase of loss in war, and  for  an  increase  in  what  they  hemorrhage  of wealth and of things that are precious to them, for tomorrow is close at hand.

There is no god but Him. He grants the truth victory, even if after some time. And may blessings and peace be upon the Imam of the Messengers, and may Allah be pleased with his companions from the Ansar and the Muhajirin. To proceed:Allah \uf063 said, \u201cThey want to extinguish the light  of  Allah  with  their  mouths,  but  Allah  refuses  except  to  complete  His  light,  even  if  the disbelievers hate it. He is the One who sent His Messenger  with  guidance  and  the  religion  of truth to make it prevail over all religion, even if the mushrikin despise such\u201d (At-Tawbah 32-33). Thus, every Muslim must be certain that complete  victory  is  coming,  that  Allah  will  honor this religion, that the future belongs to it, even if all nations rabidly contend against us, and that we shall definitely rule the earth by the might of Allah,  the  Powerful,  the  Strong.  And  whoever rejects or doubts that is nothing but one of the disbelieving  fearmongers.\nAllah,  the  True  King,  said,  \u201cAnd  We  have written  in  the  Zabur  after  previous  revelation that the earth shall be inherited by My righteous slaves. Verily in that is a message to a worshiping  people\u201d  (Al-Anbiya  105-106).  The  truthful and trusted prophet \uf067 said, \u201cThis matter shall reach  all  that  the  night  and  day  have  reached, and Allah will not leave a house of mud or fur [i.e. dwellings in the city or desert] except that He will make this religion enter it, through glory or humiliation \u2013 glory by which Allah glorifies Islam and humiliation by which Allah humbles the disbelievers\u201d (Reported by Ahmad). This was narrated  by Tamim  ad-Dari,  who  then  said,  \u201cI recognized that in my own household. Those of them who accepted Islam received much good, honor,  and  glory.  And  those  of  them  who  remained in kufr were afflicted with humiliation, subservience,  and  the  jizyah.\u201d\nThe  people  of  tawhid  must  know  that  a \u2018aqidah  (creed)  for  which  pure  blood  has  been spilled and for which shuhada have fought, lived, and died will definitely be victorious. Its arrows will extend to strike the neck of every kafir. And it  will  enlighten  the  heart  of  every  muwahhid. \n18Article\nBut we must all realize that the condition for victory is following the Prophet \uf067. If this adherence is present, victory shall  come,  and  if  it  is  absent,  there  shall  be  no  victory. No other cause rivals it, as the scholars have explained. Ibnul-Qayyim \uf072 said, \u201cAs such, victory and complete support is only for the people of complete iman. Allah \uf063 said, \u2018Indeed, We shall support Our messengers and those who believed, in the worldly life and on the day the witnesses rise\u2019 (Ghafir 51), and He said, \u2018So We empowered those who believed against their enemy, so they became victors\u2019 (As-Saff 14). Thus, whoever is lacking in iman will also lack in his portion of victory and support\u201d (Ighathat al-Lahfan).The Prophet \uf067 also guided us \u2013 with great detail \u2013 to both the causes for victory and the hindrances to achieving it. Ibnul-Qayyim \uf072 said, \u201cThus did he \uf067 teach them the tactics of war and confronting the enemy, as well as the paths to victory and triumph \u2013 such that if they were to learn them, comprehend them, and maintain them as they should be maintained, there would never be an enemy that could stand against them\u201d (I\u2019lam al-Muwaqqi\u2019in).\nAnd from the several causes for victory is tawhid. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cAnd they will not cease to fight you until they make you turn from your religion if they are able\u201d (Al-Baqarah 217), and He \uf063 said, \u201cThey only resented them because they believed in Allah, the Mighty, the Praised\u201d (Al-Buruj 8). This is the reality, which all mujahidin must comprehend.\nThe battle between the muwahhidin and the kafirin is fundamentally a battle of \u2018aqidah, and Allah has confined \nArticle\fing them was that all their men were to be killed and their women and children enslaved.\n\u2018Aishah \uf069 narrates, \u201cSa\u2019d [Ibn Mu\u2019adh] was wounded on the day of the trench when a man from Quraysh called Ibn al-\u2018Ariqah shot him [with an arrow] hitting an artery in his arm. Hence, Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 set up a tent for Sa\u2019d in the masjid to be close to him. When Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 came back from the trench, he put down his sword and bathed. Jibril \uf06e, shaking the dust off his head, came to him and said, \u2018You have laid down the sword? By Allah, we have not laid ours down. Set out for them.\u2019 Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u2018Where?\u2019 Jibril pointed towards Bani Quraydhah. Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 then attacked them. They later surrendered to the judgment of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067, and Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 referred the judgment concerning them to Sa\u2019d. Sa\u2019d said, \u2018My judgment concerning them is that their fighters are to be killed, their women and children are to be enslaved, and their wealth is to be divided.\u2019 \u2018Urwah Ibn az-Zubayr said, \u2018I was told that the Prophet \uf067 said, \u2018You have judged them by the judgment of Allah\u2019\u2019\u201d (Reported by Muslim). And thus, brutality towards those traitors served as a beneficial remedy, and a lesson and a warning to others.Prior to that, the Prophet \uf067 had expelled Bani an-Nadir from their homes and took their wealth as ghanimah after Allah \uf063 revealed to him their plot to assassinate him while he was in their presence. It was not long before he set out, besieging them and waging war against them, with Allah then granting him victory over them. He \uf067 also fought Bani Qaynuqa\u2019 and besieged them and did the same with the Jews of Khaybar, fighting them and conquering their fortresses by force (Sirat Ibn Hisham).\nAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 likewise would not be silent concerning the right of those Muslims killed treacherously and unjustly, unlike the evil scholars who discourage the Muslims from rising up and taking revenge against those kuffar who kill them, spill their blood, and violate their women. Ibn Kathir said, \u201cAl-Waqidi said, \u2018In the month of Shawwal, the 6th year after the Hijrah, the detachment of Kurz Ibn Jabir al-Fihri was sent to the \u2018Uraniyyin who killed the shepherd of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 and herded away the camels.\u2019\u201d\nAnas  \uf068  narrated  that  a  group  of  people  from  \u2018Ukl and  \u2018Uraynah  came  to  the  Prophet  \uf067  openly  manifesting Islam, and said, \u201cO Prophet of Allah, indeed we are a people of livestock and not a people of agriculture.\u201d They could not bear the nature of Madinah and had gotten ill. So the Prophet \uf067 ordered that they be lent a number of camels and a shepherd, and ordered the group from \u2018Ukl and  \u2018Uraynah  to  head  out  with  the  shepherd  and  drink the milk and urine of the camels. They set out, and when they reached the area of the lava field, they disbelieved after having embraced Islam, killed the Prophet\u2019s shepherd, and herded away the camels. This then reached the Prophet \uf067, so he dispatched a party in their pursuit and gave them orders [on how to punish them]. So they melted their eyes with heated nails, cut off their hands, and left them in the area of the lava field until they died in that state (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nThis was the punishment done by Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067. Even though he had forbidden mutilation, taking retribu-\ntion from these criminal apostates and their likes is something established in the religion. Thus, he did not let the killers of his shepherd go free. Rather, he sent a detachment to detain them and carry out the ruling of retribution on them.\nAnd during the conquest of Makkah (may Allah bring it back under the rule of the Muslims), Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 ordered for a number of individuals to be killed even if they were found clinging to the curtains of the Ka\u2019bah. Anas \uf068 narrated that the Prophet \uf067 entered Makkah the year of the conquest wearing a helmet. When he took it off, a man came to him and said, \u201cIbn Khatal is clinging to the curtains of the Ka\u2019bah.\u201d He responded, \u201cKill him\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nSa\u2019d Ibn Abi Waqqas \uf068 said, \u201cOn the day of the conquest of Makkah, Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 granted amnesty to all the people except four men and two women, saying, \u2018Kill them, even if you find them clinging to the curtains of the Ka\u2019bah\u2019\u201d (Reported by an-Nasai).\nThis prophetic order was also due to their harming Islam and the Muslims. The curtains of the noble Ka\u2019bah could not shield them from the law of the Lord of the creation after the severe kufr they had perpetrated with their hands and tongues.\nThese evidences from the Sirah of the Messenger \uf067 \u2013 and there are many others \u2013 do not negate from him the characteristic of compassion and mercy. Rather, these traits are in accordance with Allah\u2019s words, \u201cMuhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those with him are severe against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves\u201d (Fath 29). Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 carried out the command of Allah \uf062, who said, \u201cO you who have believed, fight those disbelievers near you and let them find brutality in you\u201d (At-Tawbah 123).\nLikewise, just as he \uf067 is the prophet of mercy, he is also the prophet of slaughter. As for taking his compassion and mercy for the allies of Allah and applying it to the enemies of Allah, then this is the methodology of the taghut scholars who want the Muslims to compromise with their enemies. Rather, the taghut scholars want the Muslims to obey their enemies as much as possible. And if the Muslim rushes to massacre the enemies of Allah and does to them just as they have done to the Muslims, including killing and humiliating them, these devils hasten to denounce him, \u201cwarning\u201d against the image of Islam and the Muslims being distorted. But of which \u201cIslam\u201d do they speak and what religion do they follow?! The religion of the taghut scholars is nothing but apostasy, which can only be cleansed by unsheathing the sword of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq \uf068.\nPart 2: In the History of the Rashid Khulafa \uf06a\nThe Sahabah \uf06a were people with the softest of hearts, the best of them in morals and character, and the most sincere of them in da\u2019wah, spreading the religion, and raising the banner of Islam. They were the most serious of people in holding tightly to the Sunnah of the Messenger \uf067 in all matters. Amongst these matters, was his guidance in dealing with the kuffar during war. The Sahabah were severe against the kuffar, showing harshness to them by sword and \n\f", "schema:headline": "Paths to Victory - Part 1", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "17"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3-Just-Terror-Tactics---Part-2", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "3", "schema:articleBody": "Vehicle Attacks\nThough being an essential part of modern life, very few actually comprehend the deadly and destructive capability of the motor vehicle and its capacity of reaping large numbers of casualties if used in a premeditated manner. This was superbly demonstrated in the attack  launched  by  the  brother  Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel  who,  while  traveling  at the speed of approximately 90 kilometers per hour, plowed his 19-ton load-bearing truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day in Nice, France,  harvesting  through  his  attack  the slaughter of 86 Crusader citizens and injuring 434 more.\nThe method of such an attack is that a vehicle is plunged at a high speed into a large congregation of kuffar, smashing their bodies with the vehicle\u2019s strong outer frame, while advancing  forward  \u2013  crushing  their  heads, torsos, and limbs under the vehicle\u2019s wheels and  chassis  \u2013  and  leaving  behind  a  trail  of carnage.\nStationed behind enemy lines, the just terror mujahid has at his disposal a multitude of weapons and techniques that he may employ at any given time to inflict misery and destruction upon the enemies of Allah, demonstrating by his actions an unforgettable lesson for every hardheaded, obstinate kafir nation that wishes to engage in war on the Islamic State. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cThrough them, disperse those behind them, that they might take heed\u201d (Al-Anfal 57). Ibn Kathir \uf073 said, explaining this verse, \u201cIt means, punish them severely and massacre them violently so that other enemies from the Arabs and non-Arabs are terrified and those punished and massacred become a lesson for the other enemies \u2018that they might take heed.\u2019\u201dWhen seeking to initiate an attack, it is important to define the objective. One\u2019s attack may be to harvest a large kill count. It may be aimed at disrupting the financial stability of a specific nation. It may simply be aimed at terrorizing the enemies of Allah and depriving them of a peaceful sleep. Accordingly, as the objective of the attack varies, the mujahid must choose a method that best suits the operation at hand.\nExclusive\n\fkufr after Allah saved him therefrom just as he hates being thrown into fire\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Anas). Abu \u2018Abdillah loved Allah and His Messenger more than anything or anyone else. An incident demonstrating this was when he was attending a da\u2019wah road show and stabbed a kafir in the back of the head with a pen for insulting the Prophet \uf067. He did this on a busy street in the heart of Brtian without any care for the consequences of his actions or any fear of the blame of critics, for he understood his duty and knew it was a tremendous honor and privilege to be allowed to defend the Prophet \uf067.\nShortly  after  this  incident,  Abu  \u2018Abdillah  left  for  the blessed land of Sham to join the jihad, despite already having attempted to do so before. Not being content with the life of humiliation, living under the rule of the kuffar, Abu \u2018Abdillah was determined to leave behind his loved ones, along with the rest of the Dunya, to be able to live a life of honor. However, when he arrived in Sham, he did not find himself in the correct company. It was just at the beginning of the Syrian Sahwah and he ended up with the wrong group, a supposedly \u201cIslamist\u201d faction. He became very confused and disheartened as he witnessed the practice of many sins amongst these so-called \u201cmujahidin,\u201d but most importantly, he later saw that the group wasn\u2019t implementing the Shari\u2019ah in the territories over which it had taken control. He was a man who could recognize the truth when he saw it and he clearly saw that these people were upon falsehood.\nHe was disheartened, but he did not lose hope in Allah\u2019s mercy, and after some time, and after traveling back and forth through Dar al-Kufr and facing various tribulations, he finally succeeded \u2013 by Allah\u2019s grace \u2013 in reaching the Islamic State and joining the ranks of its mujahidin. After completing the training camp, Abu \u2018Abdillah was sent to the frontlines for ribat. He was involved in a few battles, including the Islamic State\u2019s wide scale offensive in the northern Halab countryside during the course of which several major towns were liberated. He was a courageous mujahid who would not allow any signs of fear to show on his face or in his voice and actions, and he had full conviction that victory does not rely on numbers or the power of one\u2019s weapons, but rather, in the correctness of one\u2019s \u2018aqidah and in the strength of one\u2019s tawhid.\nHe loved performing ribat, for he understood the great reward found in the perseverance and endurance it requires, with the murabitin sometimes staying in a village for up to a month at a time, keeping guard, with no one around them. During Ramadan, he made much du\u2019a, asking Allah to grant him shahadah in that blessed month, but he did not attain shahadah that year. Little did he know, however, that his du\u2019a had been accepted, inshaallah.\nShortly  after  Ramadan,  he  was  injured,  having  been shot in the ear during a battle in Halab Wilayah, as a result of which he lost his hearing in one ear. Even whilst recovering, he didn\u2019t like to waste time, so he would spend his days memorizing the Quran and giving nasihah to the brothers around him. His eagerness and desire to resume his jihad then led him to joining tasni\u2019 (explosives manufacturing), even though he was still recovering from his injuries.\nOn the first day of working in tasni\u2019, there was a work-re-\nlated explosion at his site. Abu \u2018Abdillah sustained severe burns to his face, neck, chest, and hands. Despite him still being in the recovery process from his previous wound, Allah tested him again with another, more severe injury. The test was very difficult, and he remained in the burn unit for almost two months. The burns he sustained were very intense, especially on his hands, even to the point that all of his fingernails melted off. He became handicapped and was in constant pain, to the point that he would pass out from the intensity of the pain. In the initial stages of the injury, Abu \u2018Abdillah endured a lot of hardship and had to rely upon others to help him do almost everything. He would always apologize and feel as though he was a burden on those close to him, since he was always used to doing things for others.\nThe recovery process was very tough, but Abu \u2018Abdillah remained steadfast and patient, remembering that this was a test and a means of purification from Allah. He was a man who lived for the religion of Allah, and injuries would not stop him from supporting the cause of Allah. Rather, his burns were a constant reminder of Hellfire for him, which is something that Abu \u2018Abdillah would always think about.Abu \u2018Abdillah then began working in da\u2019wah, delivering lectures to the brothers and teaching them the religion, but his heart maintained a strong yearning to return to the battlefield, and this yearning continued to intensify as he witnessed the brothers around him all attaining shahadah one after another. He longed for the same, and after almost one year, Abu \u2018Abdillah finally received permission to join the brothers in Ramadan in the fight against the Crusader coalition forces, although he was still suffering from his injuries and had a shar\u2019i excuse to remain behind. His injuries were not hidden, and those around him could see him constantly banging his hands in order to numb the relentless pain of the new skin growth, and despite his ordeal, he longed to fight for the cause of Allah, to kill and to be killed.\nHe requested to be placed on the list for istishhadi operatives,  as  he  was  determined  to  attain  shahadah  in  the month of Ramadan. This was something he long wished for even back in Dar al-Kufr. He would always say, \u201cImagine on the Day of Judgment you come before Allah having been completely blown to pieces, and then Allah puts you back together and asks you, \u2018Why did you do this to yourself?\u2019 and you answer, \u2018I did this for You, my Lord.\u2019\u201d\nIndeed, an individual\u2019s time and place of death is decreed and destined for him no matter what he plans, and so despite Abu \u2018Abdillah\u2019s efforts to reach the area of Sirrin in Halab Wilayah in order to join the fight against the Crusader coalition forces, and despite his strong desire and intention  to  carry  out  an  istishhadi  operation,  Allah  had something else destined for him. On the 17th of Ramadan 1436AH, and whilst in the city of Raqqah, he was killed by a US drone strike, attaining shahadah thereby in the blessed month for which he prayed. We consider him a shahid and Allah is his judge. May Allah elevate his status and accept him among the siddiqqin and the best of the shuhada, and grant him comfort and tranquility in the gardens of Jannah.\n\f", "schema:headline": "Just Terror Tactics - Part 2", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "9"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah2-The-Shuhada-of-the-Gulshan-Attack", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "2", "schema:articleBody": "8Exclusive\nExclusive\f\u2022 \n\u2022 \nthus readily accessible. They are extremely easy to conceal and highly lethal, especially in the hands of someone who knows how to use them effectively. Also, due to their accessibility, were a person to conduct a campaign of knife attacks, he could dispose of his weapon after each use, finding no difficulty in acquiring another one.\nWhen  choosing  a  knife,  one  should  focus  firstly  on sharpness.  He  should  then  consider  the  strength  of  the blade and handle, and seek something reasonably sized for the job at hand. Also, it should not be too large, making it difficult to conceal, nor lacking a strong grip lest it be easily disarmed. Serrated or partially-serrated blades make for good  combat  knives.\nIt is explicitly advised not to use kitchen knives, as their basic structure is not designed to handle the kind of vigorous application used for assassinations and slaughter.\nSomething important that one should consider before acquiring a knife is to avoid troublesome knives, those that can cause harm to the user because of poor manufacturing. There are certain features that should be avoided when acquiring a knife.\nIf it lacks a guard, which is a protruding piece of metal or other material between the blade and the handle, the wielder may be harmed during the operation, as this guard is to prevent one\u2019s hand from sliding forward onto the blade when plunging it into a victim.\nFolding knives that do not feature a stable locking system should be avoided, for if enough resistance is met on the blade, the folding knife can collapse, cutting the wielder\u2019s own hand.\n\u2022  Knives that have a \u201clockback\u201d or spine lock, which is a locking system on the spine of the handle, are not a good option, for if the person holding the knife squeezes too hard on the handle, the pressure might release the locking system, causing the blade to collapse when plunged into a target.\nThe most reliable knives are fixed blade knives, where the handle and blade are crafted from a single piece of metal. This is characteristically the strongest kind of knife, since the blade extends into the handle without any moving parts.As for choosing a target, then this is just like hunting prey. When carrying out a knife operation, it is not advised to target very large gatherings or overly crowded areas, as this presents a disadvantage and only increases the likelihood of being prevented from achieving kills. Therefore, it is advised that when conducting an operation by oneself, the target should be a smaller crowd, particularly for the one strong in build or skillful in using a knife, as such attacks are proven to inflict terror. Alternatively, for one pursuing a prolonged campaign of terror, he may target lone victims. For example, the target could be a drunken kafir on a quiet road returning home from a night out, or the average kafir working his night shift, or someone walking alone in a public park or rural forested area, or someone by himself in an alley close to a night club or another place of debauchery, or even someone out for a walk in a quiet neighborhood. One should consider canals, riversides, and beaches. It may also help to carry a baton or some other kind of concealable blunt object, such as a baseball bat, to strike the victim\u2019s head with, thereby immobilizing him be-\nfore cutting his throat or stabbing him in other lethal areas to finish him off.\nRegarding  where  on  the  body  the  victim  should  be struck,  then  the  objective  here  is  to  kill  \u2013  so  the  strikes should be aimed at major organs, i.e. the heart, lungs, or main  arteries,  which  run  from  head  to  toe  along  the  inner parts of the body. These include the inner thigh, the groin area, and under the armpits, then extending up the neck. The windpipe can be cut easily by slicing the throat, which is in direct implementation of Allah\u2019s \uf063 command, \u201cSo when you meet those who disbelieve, strike their necks\u201d (Muhammad 4). Due to the hardness of the skull, it is not advised to stab the head. This can risk breaking the knife or causing the blade to become stuck in the skull, thereby making it difficult to extract the weapon.\nAdditionally, it should be stressed that the objective of a knife attack is to attain a reasonable kill count, while equally \u2013 if not more importantly \u2013 to inflict terror on the Crusader citizens of the land in which the operation is carried out. On this basis, the more gruesome the attack, the closer one comes to achieving the desired objective. Nevertheless, it is advised to not necessarily attempt to fully detach the head, as the absence of technique can cause a person to spend a long time attempting to do so, that is, unless the individual\u2019s circumstances and capabilities allow for such. Simply cutting the throat, just as one would slaughter a sheep, is sufficient.\nWhen attacking a victim wearing leather, jeans, or similarly  tough  material,  then  one  should  avoid  striking  the clothed areas. Instead, he should try to strike the exposed skin of the neck, etc. However, if very necessary, a strike with enough force should clear the clothing and penetrate the skin.\nThe psyche of most living creatures, when they perceive a threat, is explained in the concept of \u201cfight or flight.\u201d This practically means that once the assault is initiated, though the target may be injured, he may still attempt to resist. A swift slice across the face should quickly subdue them, as very few people will continue to fight once the smell, feel, and sight of blood becomes apparent. If the target is alone, the  aim  should  be  to  incapacitate  him  as  quickly  and  as silently as possible. This should be followed up with slitting his throat.\nLest the operation be mistaken for one of the many random acts of violence that plague the West, it is essential to leave some kind of evidence or insignia identifying the motive and allegiance to the Khalifah, even if it is something as simple as a note pinned or attached to the victim\u2019s body, or a final testament if the operation will be of a nature where the expected outcome is one\u2019s shahadah.\nThe overall objective of any just terror operation is to bring horror and misery to the enemies of Allah \uf066, and to remind them that their efforts to wage war against Islam and the Muslims will only lead to more and more mujahidin appearing in their very midst, ready to strike them mercilessly on their own soil. So, \u201cLet them find harshness in you\u201d (At-Tawbah 123). And remember that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cNever shall the kafir and his killer be united in the Fire\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah).\n\f", "schema:headline": "The Shuhada of the Gulshan Attack", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "7"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah6-Shedding-Light-on-the-Blessed-Operation-in-Istanbul", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "6", "schema:articleBody": "With  every  act  of  the  mujahidin  that  harms  the mushrikin, the people of kufr and deviance come out with their tongues and pens to alter the details and flip the truth. Their aim is to defame and vilify the muwahhidin, showing them as corrupt sinners who care nothing for the sanctity of life or religion. They weep deceitful tears over a religion in which they have disbelieved and over blood, the likes of which they have shed many times more. Such was the case following the latest attack in Istanbul, in which Islamic State soldiers targeted the mushrikin during one of their  parties,  celebrating  the  European  \u201cNew Year.\u201d As  a  result,  they  filled  the  world  with  noisy  claims that  the  muwahhidin  had  spilled  inviolable  blood and  killed  those  who  should  be  protected. We  will shed some light on various aspects of the situation, so that it will be clear for the Muslims and that the criminals  will  be  exposed.\nWe must not submit to the media of the tawaghit concerning  what  they  release  of  names  of  the  dead and wounded. The evidence, both old and new, is sufficient to establish their deceit in misleading people in this regard. This is like what the tawaghit of Jordan did after the blessed operations in the hotels of \u2018Amman,  where  Crusader  gatherings  of  CIA  agents and murtaddin of the Iraqi Sahwat were targeted. The tawaghit  of  Jordan  hid  this  truth  and  claimed  that the \u201cvictims\u201d were only a group of people celebrating a wedding at the hotel \u2013 those who could have been collaterally hit by the explosive storm of the istishhadi belts while they targeted the Crusaders and murtaddin.\nFitnah Is More Severe than Killing\nAllah  c  said,  \u201cThey  ask  you  about  the  sacred month, about fighting therein. Say, \u2018Fighting therein is a great sin, but averting [people] from the cause of Allah, disbelieving in Him and (denying the sanctity of) al-Masjid al-Haram, and expelling its people therefrom  are  greater  sins  according  to  Allah.  And \nFeature\nfitnah  is  greater  than  killing\u2019\u201d  (Al-Baqarah  217). Ibn Kathir \uf072 commented on the reason this ayah was revealed, saying, \u201cIbn Mas\u2019ud said that Allah\u2019s Messenger  g  dispatched  a  raiding  party  of  seven men led by \u2018Abdullah Ibn Jahsh al-Asadi\u2026 Ibn Jahsh went into a patch of palms and found there al-Hakam Ibn Kaysan, al-Mughirah Ibn \u2018Uthman, \u2018Amr Ibn al-Hadrami, and \u2018Abdullah Ibnul-Mughirah. Ibnul-Mughirah escaped, but al-Hakam Ibn Kaysan  and  al-Mughirah  were  captured,  while \u2018Amr  was  killed  by  Waqid  Ibn  \u2018Abdillah.  They seized  the  first  ghanimah  taken  by  the  Prophet\u2019s g  companions\u2026  So  the  mushrikin  made  a  deceptive allegation, saying, \u2018Muhammad claims to be  obedient  to  Allah,  but  he  is  the  first  to  shed blood in the sacred month, as he killed our people during Rajab.\u2019 The Muslims responded, saying, \u2018We killed them during Jumada,\u2019 and it is said that it was at the very onset of Rajab, meaning the last night of Jumada, and the Muslims sheathed their swords when the month of Rajab started. So Allah rebuked  the  people  of  Makkah,  revealing,  \u2018They ask  you  about  the  sacred  month,  about  fighting \n\fThe murtadd, Erdogan, with his Crusader ally, Putin\na barrier to block Islamic State mujahidin from reaching their lands.\nHowever, whoever scrutinizes the actual situation on the map and the ongoing political events in both Turkey and Sham will recognize that the importance of  this  area  to  the  apostate Turkish  government  far surpasses  the  issue  of  destroying  the  plans  of  the Kurdish state, despite its importance to them. This is because the Turkish army\u2019s assertion of control over some part of Sham will be a means of great pressure on the Nusayri regime in the future, which will exceed the  importance  of  controlling  the  many  factions  of the Sahwah murtaddin \u2013 meaning that they will reap many rewards in a future withdrawal, no matter what kind of taghut government is set up in Damascus.\nLikewise,  Turkey\u2019s  partial  control  over  this  area with  Russian  or  American  air  cover,  would  prevent the Nusayri regime from bombarding it. This would help Turkey  to  eventually  rid  itself  of  a  large  number of undesirable refugees (those who are disruptive or offer little benefit to Turkey) by opening refugee camps for them in this area. Such would also alleviate much of the great costs burdening the declining Turkish  economy.\nThat  is  aside  from  being  able  to  recruit  fighters from these camps to further the future projects of the Turkish army inside Sham. And just as Iran has taken control of the Rafidi militias in the framework of the \u201cRafidi Mobilization,\u201d using it to achieve its goals, so too has Turkey begun speaking about a \u201cSahwah Mo-\nbilization\u201d to be used for serving its interests in Sham and the rest of the region.\nThe Accepted Safe Zone\nWith  every  Crusader-observed  peace  agreement made  between  the  Nusayri  regime  and  the  Sahwah murtaddin,  the  Russians  speak  of  the  necessity  of isolating the \u201cextremists\u201d from the \u201cmoderate opposition,\u201d despite their knowledge of the strong alliance between all of the murtadd Sahwah factions \u2013 whether they openly declare secularism or they falsely claim to  rule  by  Shari\u2019ah.  This  \u201cnecessity\u201d  comes  as  Russian bombers target these \u201cextremists\u201d who refuse to (openly)  negotiate  with  the  Nusayri  regime,  unlike the \u201cmoderates\u201d who have accepted to do so, entrusting  that  to  the  former  Nusayri  prime  minister,  the murtadd  Riyad  Hijab.\nBut such distinction could not happen due to the great mix of these two types of Sahwat, those who accepted the negotiations and those who rejected them, as well as due to the inability of the \u201cmoderates\u201d to expel the \u201cothers\u201d from amongst them. This was clearly manifested in the city of Halab before its complete fall  into  the  hands  of  the  Nusayri  army,  which  was presented by the taghut Erdogan in a way acceptable to  the  Sahwah  murtaddin.  And  by  doing  so,  he  simultaneously  insured  the  Russian-Nusayri  consent for him to build the \u201cSafe Zone,\u201d making it an area for  isolating  the  \u201cmoderate\u201d  Sahwat  from  the  \u201cex-\n\f", "schema:headline": "Shedding Light on the Blessed Operation in Istanbul", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "11"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah2-Important-Memorandums", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "2", "schema:articleBody": "The rulings on those who refrain from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam and those who refrain from making takfir of Sahwah factions who claim jihad are important matters that should be addressed, as they are related to the matter of tawhid and iman, the heart and soul of the religion. Thus, one of the chief offices of the Khilafah \u2013 the Central Office Overseeing Shar\u2019i Dawawin \u2013 addressed the issues in two memorandums, which will be quoted below.\nThe memorandum on the ruling of those who refrain from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam begins by presenting two positions \u201cboth being incorrect due to excess on one hand and negligence on the other,\u201d defining the term \u201casl ad-din\u201d (the foundation of the religion) used in both as \u201cthat by which tawhid is established before the advent of the prophetic proof.\u201dThe first position presented was that \u201cwhoever refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam, is a mushrik exactly like them, because making takfir of them is part of asl ad-din. So the refrainer is exactly  like  those  who  worship  others  besides  Allah, and  he  is  absolutely  one  of  them  in  both  name  and ruling.\u201d\nThe second position presented after was that \u201ctakfir is not part of asl ad-din, but is one of its inferred requirements. So the one who refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam, has not disbelieved until  the  hujjah  (evidenced  argument)  is  established against him, all shubuhat (doubts) are removed, and his tawil (misinterpretation) is eliminated.\u201d\nThe  memorandum  then  explains  that  \u201cthe  first claim implies a corrupt concept, because major shirk has a reality and description that, if actualized, desig-\nnates the one who possesses it a mushrik. If we were to absolutely equate the one who refrains from takfir with the one who worships others besides Allah, then making  takfir  of  the  one  who  refrains  from  making takfir of the refrainer would be absolutely necessitated, since major shirk is not excused by ignorance and the refrainer (according to the first claim) is a mushrik exactly like the initial person [the mushrik worshiping others besides Allah]. And the one who refrains thereafter [from making takfir of the other refrainers in the chain] is also a mushrik [exactly like the initial person], and so on. This is the actual inference \u2013 not an imagined understanding \u2013 of this claim\u2019s line of reasoning. This line of reasoning leads to making chain-takfir, an invalid  bid\u2019ah  that  can  never  be  controlled  and  that originates from an incorrect understanding of the texts. This claim is rejected due to the invalidity of its inference.\u201d\nThe memorandum goes on to explain that \u201cthe second claim also implies a corrupt concept, as it makes takfir of the mushrikin like one of the masail khafiyyah (obscure  issues),  for  which  it  is  impossible  to  establish  the  hujjah  and  impossible  to  make  takfir  of  the refrainer as long as he has some shubhah (doubt) or tawil. The essence of this claim is the annulment of an agreed upon nullifier of Islam. Whereas, the existence of shubhah is a passing matter that must be eliminated\u2026 As for making this passing matter a foundation upon which rulings are based, then this would result in the annulment of these rulings and the nullification of what it means to manifest the religion. This is in opposition to what is transmitted from the imams of the religion, including the imams of the Najdi da\u2019wah \uf073.\u201d\n4Exclusive\nExclusive\fThe aftermath of the Holey Artisan Bakery attack\nAs  the  aircrafts  and  drones  of  the  Crusader  coalition continue to bomb and terrorize the Muslims of Iraq, Sham, Libya,  and  other  wilayat  of  the  Khilafah,  their  Muslim brothers and sisters all over the world read the news with aching pain as the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cThe believers, in their love, mercy, and sympathy, are like one single body. When one of the limbs suffers, the whole body responds to it with insomnia and fever\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from an-Nu\u2019man Ibn Bashir). These Muslims realize that the Crusader leaders who give the orders to brutally bomb the Muslims don\u2019t come from an abstract vacuum; rather, they come into power via the blessings of the constituency of their citizenry, those who partake in their democratic system or accept its results. These Muslims also realize that the huge costs associated with bombs dropped by these aircrafts and drones are largely financed through the tax money generated from the so-called \u201cinnocent civilians\u201d of these democratic nations, those \u201ccivilians\u201d who recognize the legitimacy of policies derived by their democracies, policies including the government spending of tax money on wars waged against Islam and the Muslims. Thus, there remains no doubt in the hearts of these Muslims that the destruction of lives and property in the wilayat of the Khilafah by Crusader jets and drones is to be directly blamed on the purported \u201cpower of the people,\u201d i.e. the power of the socalled \u201cinnocent civilians\u201d of the Crusader nations.1\nAllah \uf063 said, \u201cFight them; Allah will punish them by your hands and will disgrace them and give you victory over them and satisfy the breasts of a believing people and re-\n1   Editor\u2019s Note: Here, the author \uf074 emphasizes that the blood and wealth of adult, Crusader \u201ccivilians\u201d from democratic nations waging war against Islam and the Muslims is more deserving to be spilled than that of other kafir \u201ccivilians,\u201d whose blood is already mubah (permissible) to spill.

And know that Allah is with the pious\u201d (At-Tawbah 36). \u2018Umar Ibn al-Khattab \uf068 said, after being informed of a murder case, \u201cIf the people of San\u2019a cooperated in his killing, I would have them all killed\u201d (Reported by Malik).Thus, on the night of the 27th of Ramadan 1437, the Soldiers of the Khilafah in Bengal decided to send an inghimasi team of five shahadah knights to the Holey Artisan Bakery restaurant in Gulshan, Dhaka, in order to give the Crusaders a taste of their own medicine. With tawfiq from Allah, the inghimasi brothers were able to kill all the kuffar in the restaurant, kill and wound many of the murtadd Bengali soldiers, and hold the Crusader-owned restaurant under siege for almost 12 hours against hundreds of murtadd Bengali soldiers before achieving shahadah, walhamdulillah.2 We ask Allah to accept them as shuhada and inspire many more muwahhidin in Bengal and in other parts of the world through their deeds. Amin.\nAfter  a  careful  survey  of  several  potential  targets,  the Crusader-owned Holey Artisan Bakery restaurant was selected for this blessed operation because it was well known for being frequented by the citizens of Crusader countries and other kafir nations. It was a sinister place where the Crusaders would gather to drink alcohol and commit vices throughout the night, feeling secure from the wrath of Allah that was awaiting them.\nThe night of the 27th of Ramadan was chosen because of the huge rewards that it could potentially bring to the mujahid  brothers,  as  it  may  possibly  be  Laylat  al-Qadr, \n2   Editor\u2019s Note: The final tally was 24 dead kuffar and murtaddin from America, Italy, Japan, India, and Bengal.

Allah \uf063 said, \u201cHe knew what was in their hearts, so He sent tranquility upon them and awarded them an imminent conquest\u201d (Al-Fath 18), i.e. what was in their hearts of truthfulness, loyalty, and sincerity of intention by pledging allegiance to Allah, Lord of the creation.\nThis verse thus indicates that sincerity of intention is a  condition  of  consolidation,  and  that  once  sincerity  is present,  Allah  will  give  the  reward  of  conquest,  victory, and consolidation. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cSo whoever hopes to meet his Lord, then he must work righteous deeds and not commit shirk towards anyone in the worship of his Lord\u201d (Al-Kahf  110).  And  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  \uf067  said,  \u201cVerily what I fear most for you is minor shirk\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from Mahmud Ibn Labid). As such, the Prophet \uf067 was very diligent in warning his companions of this threat \u2013 especially in jihad \u2013 lest the threat overtake their hearts. He focused even more, in this regards, on the commanders of jihad, saying, \u201cIndeed, we, by Allah, do not appoint to this work anyone who requested it, nor anyone who hoped to attain it\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim \nThe Crusaders could not handle fighting the mujahidin\nfrom Abu Musa al-Ash\u2019ari).\n\u2018Abdur-Rahman Ibn Samurah said that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said to him, \u201cO \u2018Abdur-Rahman Ibn Samurah, do not request a command position, for if you were given it not due to a request, you would be assisted [by Allah] in it. And if you were given it due to a request, you would be left alone to it\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim). An-Nawawi  said,  \u201cThe  scholars  have  said  that  the  wisdom  behind  not  appointing  someone  who  has  requested  an  appointment  is  that  he  would  be  left  alone  to  it and have no assistance [from Allah], just as the hadith of \u2018Abdur-Rahman Ibn Samurah clearly states. And if he has no assistance, then he is not suitable, and suitability is a requirement for the appointment\u201d (Sharh Sahih Muslim).Likewise,  a  person  could  have  a  good  history  in  his path  towards  Allah  and  jihad  for  Allah\u2019s  sake,  having much good that only Allah knows, but he is not right for a  command  position,  even  if  he  thinks  himself  capable of handling it. Abu Dharr \uf068 said, \u201cI said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, why do you not employ me in a command position?\u2019 So he put his hand on my shoulder and said, \u2018O Abu Dharr, you are weak and this is a trust; and on Resurrection Day, it will be a disgrace and a source of regret\u2019\u201d \n\f", "schema:headline": "The Religion of Islam and the Jama\u2019ah of the Muslims - Part 3", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "13"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah11-The-Ruling-on-Ghanimah,-Fay,-and-Ihtitab", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the creation.

But unlike knives, which if found in one\u2019s possession can be a cause for suspicion, vehicles arouse absolutely no doubts due to their widespread use throughout the world. It is for this obvious reason that using a vehicle is one of the most comprehensive methods of attack, as it presents the opportunity for just terror for anyone possessing the ability to drive a vehicle. Likewise, it is one of the safest and easiest weapons one could employ against the kuffar, while being from amongst the most lethal methods of attack and the most successful in harvesting large numbers of the kuffar.\nAcquiring a vehicle is a simple task regardless of one\u2019s location. However, the type of vehicle and its structural and technical specifications are extremely important factors for ensuring the success of the operation. Observing previous vehicle attacks, it has been shown that smaller vehicles are incapable  of  granting  the  level  of  carnage  that  is  sought. Similarly, off-roaders, SUVs, and four-wheel drive vehicles lack the necessary attributes required for causing a blood bath. One of the main reasons for this is that smaller vehicles lack the weight and wheel span required for crushing many victims. Thus, smaller vehicles are least suitable for this kind of attack. Rather, the type of vehicle most appropriate for such an operation is a large load-bearing truck.\nThe Ideal Vehicle\n\u2022\t Load-bearing truck\u2022\t Large in size, keeping in mind its controlla-\nbility\n\u2022\t Reasonably fast in speed or rate of acceleration (Note: Many European countries pre-restrict larger vehicles to specified speeds)\n\u2022\t Heavy in weight, assuring the destruction of \nwhatever it hits\n\u2022\t Double-wheeled,  giving  victims  less  of  a chance to escape being crushed by the vehicle\u2019s  tires\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t Possessing a slightly raised chassis (the under frame of the vehicle) and bumper, which allow for the mounting of sidewalks and breeching of barriers if neededIf accessible, with a metal outer frame which are usually found in older cars, as the stronger  outer  frame  allows  for  more  damage  to be caused when the vehicle is slammed into crowds, contrary to newer cars that are usually made of plastics and other weaker materials\nVehicles to Avoid\nhour\n\u2022\t Small cars, including larger SUVs\u2022\t Slower vehicles that cannot exceed 90km per \n\u2022\t Load-bearing trucks with load compartments that  are  not  fixed  to  the  cabin,  which  may cause loss of control and subsequent jackknifing,  especially  if  driven  erratically\n\u2022\t Load-bearing trucks with excessively elongated trailer compartments, which can cause the driver trouble as he seeks to maneuver\nIf one has the wealth, buying a vehicle would be the easiest  option.  Alternatively,  one  could  rent  a  vehicle  or simply ask to borrow one from an acquaintance or relative who owns or has access thereto. For the one not capable of attaining a vehicle by any of these means, there is the option  of  hotwiring  or  carjacking  a  vehicle.

Thus, whoever does not single out Allah with ilahiyyah in all forms of worship and obedience has nullified the shahadah of tawhid and \u2013 through his actions \u2013 has belied what he claims of belief in the tawhid of rububiyyah and al-asma was-sifat.\nFrom among the different forms of worship that Allah \uf065 has singled out for mention in His Book and in the Sunnah of His Prophet \uf067 is the act of seeking judgment from His legislation alone and ruling by it alone. This is what is necessitated by one\u2019s belief that Allah is \u201cthe most just of judges\u201d (Hud 45) and \u201cthe best of judges\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 57), that there is none more just in word than Allah, that there is none better than Him in judgment, \n1    Tawhid is traditionally categorized by scholars into three categories: rububiyyah, uluhiyyah, and al-asma was-sifat. Tawhid of rububiyyah (lordship) means that there is no Lord but Allah, no one creates except Him, and no one provides the creation with what it needs save Him. This tawhid was recognized by the Arab mushrikin, as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cIf you were to ask them, \u2018Who created the heavens and the earth?\u2019 they indeed would say, \u2018Allah.\u2019 Say, \u2018Then have you considered what you supplicate besides Allah? If Allah intended me harm, are they removers of His harm; or if He intended me mercy, are they withholders of His mercy?\u2019 Say, \u2018Sufficient for me is Allah; upon Him [alone] rely the  [wise]  reliers\u2019\u201d  (Az-Zumar  38).  This  tawhid  did  not  exclude  the mushrikin from takfir nor did it save them from the sword and Hellfire. Allah \uf063 said in this regards, \u201cMost of them believe not in Allah except while they commit shirk\u201d (Yusuf 108), meaning, they believe in rububiyyah but disbelieve in uluhiyyah. Tawhid of uluhiyyah is to worship Allah alone, as none deserves to be worshiped except Him. Tawhid of al-asma was-sifat means that Allah \uf063 has the most beautiful names and loftiest attributes and that He has no equal therein.\nArticle\n\fIbn \u2018Umar). They responded to the command of Allah and His Messenger, being truthful to Allah and His Messenger,  thus  victory  over  their  enemies  came  through truthfulness in listening and obeying and through seriousness when following Allah\u2019s orders.\nThe Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever obeys me has indeed obeyed Allah, and whoever disobeys me has indeed disobeyed  Allah;  and  whoever  obeys  my  emir  has  indeed obeyed me, and whoever disobeys my emir has indeed disobeyed  me\u201d  (Reported  by  al-Bukhari  and  Muslim from  Abu  Hurayrah).\nSome matters that assist in listening and obeying the \nemir include:\nFirst, having good assumptions of the emir, as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cO you who believe! Avoid much assumption, for indeed some assumption is sinful\u201d (Al-Hujurat 12). Thinking well of Muslims in general is an obligation, but doing so with the emir is even more obligatory. There is nothing more harmful to jihad than thinking bad of the emir. How could this not be the case, when such spawns the falsest of speech? Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cBeware of  [bad]  assumptions,  for  indeed  [bad]  assumptions  is the falsest of speech\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurayrah).\nThe author of \u201cFayd al-Qadir\u201d said, \u201cA person\u2019s bad assumption of someone for whom it is not due indicates an absence of uprightness in the person himself, as it is said, \u2018When a person\u2019s deeds are bad, so are his assumptions.\u2019\u201d\nSecond, respecting the emir, as Imam Ahmad reported that Mu\u2019adh said, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 told us of five things for which a person would have a guarantee from Allah \uf062 if he were to do any thereof: Visiting a sick person, following a funeral procession, marching forth as a raider for Allah\u2019s cause, entering upon a leader to honor and respect him, or staying home so that people are safe from him and he is safe from them.\u201d\nHonoring and respecting the emir is by obeying him and  supporting  him,  as  well  as  mentioning  his  good traits, rushing to follow his orders, and advising him privately. Ibn Hajar said, \u201cBeing sincere to the leaders of the Muslims is by helping them with their responsibilities, by reminding them when they overlook [their duties], by mending their mistakes when they err, by calling others to unite with them, and by bringing fleeing hearts back to them\u201d (Fath al-Bari).\nThe fourth cause for victory is patience and steadfastness. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cO you who have believed, persevere, outlast [your enemy] in patience, perform ribat, and fear Allah that you may succeed\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 200). Since this road is long, one must take supplies; and since it is strenuous, burdensome, and full of obstacles, one must have patience and steadfastness. And since jihad is an act of worship,  which  Allah  made  a  duty  upon  us,  we  must rise for it no matter how difficult the trials become and no matter how wearisome it may be. Even if falsehood is widespread and support is scarce, one must press on.Abu  \u2018Ubaydah  Ibn  al-Jarrah  wrote  to  \u2018Umar  Ibn al-Khattab, mentioning to him the mobilization of the Romans and what was feared therefrom, so \u2018Umar wrote \nback to him, saying, \u201cAs to what follows, indeed whatever  befalls  a  believing  slave  of  hardship,  Allah  brings relief  for  him  thereafter.  Indeed,  a  hardship  will  never overwhelm  two  eases.1  Furthermore,  Allah  says  in  His book, \u2018O you who have believed, persevere, outlast [your enemy] in patience, perform ribat, and fear Allah that you may succeed\u2019\u201d (Reported by Malik from Zayd Ibn Aslam).\nAllah \uf063 also said, \u201cWe will surely test you with something of fear, hunger, poverty, death, and lack of food \u2013 and give glad tidings to those who are patient\u201d (Al-Baqarah 155). At-Tabari said, \u201cAllah \uf066 tells the followers of His Messenger \uf067 that He will test them and try them with  hardships  in  order  to  distinguish  those  who  will continue to follow the Messenger from those who will turn back on their heels\u201d (At-Tafsir).\nIn any case, the outcome of patience is good. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cIf you are patient, then it is better for the patient\u201d (An-Nahl 126). So seek Allah\u2019s aid and say as your predecessors from the mujahidin would say. \u201cWhen they came upon Jalut and his troops, they said, \u2018Our Lord! Pour patience upon us, steady our feet, and support us against the kafir people\u2019\u201d (Al-Baqarah 250). And say as the afflicted muwahhidin would say, \u201c\u2018Our Lord! Pour patience upon us and let us die as Muslims\u2019\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 126).2  Thereby,  they  became  pious  shuhada  after  they had been sorcerous kuffar.\nKnow  that  it  is  just  as  the  truthful,  trustworthy Prophet said, conveying the message of the Lord of creation, \u201cthat if the people all convened to benefit you with something,  they  would  never  benefit  you  except  with what Allah has decreed for you, and if they all convened to harm you with something, they would not harm you except with what Allah decreed against you\u201d (Reported by  Ahmad  and  at-Tirmidhi  from  Ibn  \u2018Abbas).  He  also said,  \u201cKnow  that  victory  comes  with  patience,  relief comes  with  suffering,  and  ease  comes  with  hardship\u201d (Reported  by  Ahmad  from  Ibn  \u2018Abbas).\nWhat I want to focus on is something that has been confirmed  through  experience  and  the  athar.  It  is  the great effect of the leadership\u2019s steadfastness, especially in the battlefield and when encountering the enemy. A man asked al-Bara \uf068, \u201cO Abu \u2018Umarah! Did you retreat on the Day of Hunayn?\u201d He answered, \u201cAs for Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067, he did not retreat. Abu Sufyan Ibn al-Harith held to the reins of his mule and when the mushrikin surrounded him, he \uf067 dismounted and said, \u2018I am the Prophet \u2013 no lie \u2013 I am Ibn \u2018Abdil-Muttalib!\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim). In this hadith, there are great benefits that illuminate the path.\nFirstly,  that  the  leadership  was  in  the  battlefield,  at the location of the fight, not far from the area of conflict. It did not move from one country to another, claiming that  it  is  \u201csymbolic\u201d  and  that  with  its  end  the  da\u2019wah would end. As such, the least we request of our brothers is that the emir of the wilayah remains inside his wilayah \n1   Editor\u2019s Note: He is referring to verses 5-6 of Surat ash-Sharh.\n2   Editor\u2019s Note: These were from the words of the repentant, former sorcerers of Pharaoh.\n\f", "schema:headline": "The Religion of Islam and the Jama\u2019ah of the Muslims \u2013 Part 4", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "15"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3-The-Obligation-of-Exposing-Wicked-Scholars", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "3", "schema:articleBody": "There  is  no  doubt  that  protecting  the  religion  is  the greatest  of  priorities.

Accordingly, it is a duty to warn the Ummah of shirk and bid\u2019ah, proclaim the condition of those who practice and propagate such, and expose their evil and falsehood. This is part of the obligatory nasihah1, to safeguard the religion of Muslims, just as the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cReligion is nasihah.\u201d He was asked, \u201cTo whom?\u201d He said, \u201cTo Allah, to His Book, to His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and their public\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Tamim  ad-Darri).\nLikewise,  refuting  the  people  of  bida\u2019  and  warning against them is a part of commanding virtue and forbidding vice. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cLet there be a group of you who call to good, command virtue, and forbid vice; and those [who do so] are the successful\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 104).\nIbn Taymiyyah \uf072 said, \u201cRegarding the imams of bida\u2019, those who make statements or promote acts of worship at odds with the Quran and the Sunnah, then exposing them and  warning  the  Ummah  against  them  is  obligatory  according  to  all  Muslims\u2026  Because  purifying  Allah\u2019s  path, His religion, His methodology, and His Shari\u2019ah, as well as repelling the deviance and transgression of such people is fard kifayah2 according to all Muslims. If it were not for \nAllah raising individuals to repel the harm caused by such people, the religion would have become corrupted. Its corruption thereby is far worse than the corruption caused by a war-waging enemy seizing the land. This is because when the enemy seizes the land, they do not corrupt the Muslims\u2019 hearts or the religion contained therein, except as an eventual consequence. As for the people of bida\u2019, then they corrupt the hearts initially\u201d (Majmu\u2019 al-Fatawa).\nIt was established in the Sunnah that it is permissible to speak about a wicked man and to fault him, referring to him by his name. The person of bid\u2019ah is the same, and speaking ill of him in order to warn others against him is likewise permissible. \u2018Aishah \uf069 said, \u201cA man sought permission to enter upon Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067, so he said, \u2018Allow him to enter, how wicked a member of his tribe he is.\u2019 When he entered, the Prophet \uf067 spoke kindly to him. After the man left, I said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, you said what you said about him and then you spoke kindly to him?\u2019 He said, \u2018O \u2018Aishah, indeed the worst person on Resurrection Day is he whom others abandon to avoid his wickedness\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).3\nThe Salaf would warn others of taking knowledge from the people of bid\u2019ah, just as Muslim reported in his sahih from Imam Muhammad Ibn Sirin \uf072, who said, \u201cIndeed, this knowledge is religion, so be observant of those from whom  you  take  your  religion.\u201d  He  also  said,  \u201cThey  used \n1      Nasihah  means  \u201csincerity\u201d  and  is  manifested  between  people through giving earnest advice, defending each other, not betraying each other, etc.\n2   An obligation of sufficiency, or fard kifayah, means that as long as a sufficient amount of people fulfill the obligation, the rest of the Ummah is absolved therefrom. But whenever there is not a sufficient \namount of people to engage the obligation, each Muslim who neglects it \u2013 while he is able to fulfill it \u2013 is sinful.\n3   This man was \u2018Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari, the chief of his tribe, who would later join the murtaddin during the War of Riddah. He was captured by Khalid Ibn al-Walid and sent in chains to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, who then accepted his repentance and released him.\nArticle\fthe Muslim making du\u2019a for the defeat of the mushrikin and the victory of the believers.\nThis form of jihad (the jihad through du\u2019a) is more emphasized in the case of those for whom Allah exempted from fighting for His cause, such as women, the ill, the disabled, and the imprisoned. They should all make du\u2019a for the mujahidin, for indeed, when Allah excused the exempted, He did so on condition that they are sincere towards Allah and His Messenger, and this includes making du\u2019a for the allies of Allah, the followers of His Messenger \uf067. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cThere is not upon the weak or upon the ill or upon those who do not find anything to spend any blame if they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger.  There  is  not  upon  the  doers  of  good  any cause [for blame]. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful\u201d (At-Tawbah  91).\nRather,  the  du\u2019a  of  the  weak  is  from  the  most  important  means  of  victory  for  the  Muslims  and  defeating  the  kuffar,  as  the  Prophet  \uf067  said  to  Sa\u2019d  Ibn  Abi Waqqas \uf068, \u201cAre you granted victory or given provision except by means of the weak among you\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari).  In  the  narration  of  an-Nasai,  he  \uf067  said, \u201cIndeed,  Allah  gives  victory  to  this  Ummah  by  means of its weak, through their du\u2019a, their prayers, and their sincerity.\u201d\nIbn  Hajar  said,  \u201cAs-Suhayli  said,  \u2018Jihad  at  times  is done with weapons and at times is done through du\u2019a\u2019\u201d (Fath al-Bari). This is from the apparent and established matters, except that in these days some traumatized defeatists who submitted to the idol of military technology and conceded in advance to the victory of the Crusaders over the Islamic State abandoned du\u2019a, as if it brings no benefit, and Allah\u2019s refuge is sought! This misguided conduct of some people is only due to their ignorance of this weapon, for verily if they knew the importance of du\u2019a, its magnificent effects, its form and etiquettes, and heard stories  of  Allah  answering  the  du\u2019a  of  His  slaves,  they would not have abstained from it nor clung to a means besides it.\nIt is upon the slave to know that du\u2019a contains abundant fruits and numerous virtues that cannot be counted. From among them is that du\u2019a is done in obedience to  the  order  of  Allah  \uf062,  who  said,  \u201cSupplicate  Him, being sincere to Him in religion\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 29), \u201cSupplicate Him in fear and hope\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 56), and \u201cSupplicate your Lord in humility and privately\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 55). Also, it entails the best reliance, humility, and modesty towards Allah \uf063, who said, \u201cYour Lord said, \u2018Supplicate Me; I will respond to you. Indeed, those who disdain My worship will enter Hell [rendered] contemptible\u201d (Ghafir 60). Likewise, it is a means of defending against calamities before they transpire, as the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cNothing averts qadar except du\u2019a\u201d (Reported by Ibn Majah, al-Hakim, and Ibn Hibban). Similarly, it is a means of removing calamities after they have transpired, as he \uf067 said, \u201cCaution will not prevent qadar, and du\u2019a benefits for that which has transpired and for that which has not transpired, and indeed calamity descends and du\u2019a meets it,  so  they  both  engage  each  other  until  Resurrection Day\u201d (Reported by al-Hakim). It is also a means of at-\ntaining what is sought by the du\u2019a. Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cThere is no Muslim who makes a du\u2019a, consisting not of wrongdoing or the breaking of ties, except that Allah with give him one of three things; either He will cause to transpire that for which he was making du\u2019a, or He will save it for him for the Hereafter, or He will avert for him some evil equivalent to it\u201d (Reported by Ahmad and al-Hakim). Therefore, du\u2019a is an enormous matter!Perhaps one of the most important fruits of du\u2019a is that it is a means of steadfastness, victory, and triumph over the enemy, and this is established in the Book and the  Sunnah,  in  mutawatir  form  from  the  life  of  the Prophet \uf067, the lives of his Sahabah \uf06a, and the narrations of the Salaf \uf072. In the story of the battle between Talut  and  his  believing  soldiers,  and  Jalut  and  his  disbelieving  soldiers,  what  did  the  believers  do  then  and what  was  the  conclusion?  Allah  \uf063  said,  \u201cWhen  they went  forth  to  [face]  Jalut  and  his  soldiers,  they  said, \u2018Our Lord, pour upon us patience and plant firmly our feet  and  give  us  victory  over  the  disbelieving  people\u2019\u201d (Al-Baqarah  250).  This  was  a  du\u2019a  that  the  muwahhidin made shortly before and during the course of their battle with the mushrikin, and Allah responded to them immediately. He \uf063 said, \u201cSo they defeated them by the permission  of  Allah\u201d  (Al-Baqarah  251).\nIn the Major Battle of Badr, the night before the battle,  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  \uf067  spent  the  night  praying  and making much du\u2019a while in prostration and asking Allah  for  victory  (al-Bidayah  wan-Nihayah).  On  the  day of Badr, the Prophet \uf067 looked towards his companions, who  numbered  a  little  more  than  three  hundred,  and then  looked  towards  the  mushrikin  and  saw  that  they numbered more than one thousand. Then he faced the qiblah and said, \u201cO Allah, fulfill for me what you promised me. O Allah, bring about what you promised me. O Allah, if you destroy this group from the people of Islam you will not be worshiped on the earth.\u201d Thereupon, he did not cease appealing to his Lord for aid and making du\u2019a to Him until his cloak fell from his shoulders (Reported by Muslim).\nAs for the situation of the Companions on the day of Badr, Allah depicted that they were beseeching Him for aid and making du\u2019a to Him. He said, \u201c[Remember] when  you  asked  help  of  your  Lord,  and  He  answered you\u201d  (Al-Anfal  9).  After  this  du\u2019a  of  the  Prophet  \uf067 and the Companions \uf06a what was the outcome? Allah reinforced  them  with  one  thousand  angels  following one  another,  sent  down  upon  them  tranquility,  planted  firm  their  feet,  overwhelmed  them  with  sleepiness, sent down upon them rain by which He cleansed them and  removed  from  them  the  evil  whispers  of  Shaytan, strengthened their hearts, and cast terror into the hearts of the mushrikin, thereupon the Muslims defeated the mushrikin  by  Allah\u2019s  permission.\nIn  the  Battle  of  Ahzab,  when  the  mushrikin  surrounded Madinah in a severe siege, and hunger, thirst, and  fear  intensified  for  the  Muslims,  and  their  enemy came at them from above them and from beneath them and the people\u2019s hearts reached their throats, the Prophet \uf067 humbly beseeched his Lord and persisted in his du\u2019a. \n\f", "schema:headline": "The Obligation of Exposing Wicked Scholars", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "27"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5-Interview\r-With-the-Amir-of-Hisbah-in-Sinai", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "5", "schema:articleBody": "Question: What is the condition of the Hisbah \nCenter in Sinai Wilayah?\nAnswer: All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the creation.  May  blessings  and  peace  be  upon  the prophet of mercy and massacre \u2013 the cheerful warrior \u2013 and upon his family, his companions, and those who follow him.\nFrom  the  grace  of  Allah  \uf062  upon  His  mujahid slaves in Sinai Wilayah is that they held onto the  rope  of  Allah  altogether,  fought  in  order  for Allah\u2019s word to be supreme, and remained patient during tribulation and hardship, despite the Jews and apostates uniting against the mujahidin of the wilayah, and despite the enemies of Islam attempting day and night to harm and eliminate the mujahidin of the wilayah. And how hopeless is what the enemies attempt! Allah \uf063 said, \u201cThey want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah refuses except to perfect His light, although the  disbelievers  dislike  it.  It  is  He  who  has  sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion, although the mushrikin dislike it\u201d (At-Tawbah 32-33).\nSinai Wilayah did not increase, after all these plots, except in strength and firmness, and its soldiers did not increase except in faith and steadfastness. The mujahidin of the wilayah continued to strike \u2013 with their lesser numbers \u2013 the multitudes of  the  disbelievers,  and  continued  to  implement the Shari\u2019ah of Allah as much as they could in all the areas over which they held control.\nAnd despite the war ignited here between Islam and kufr, the centers and offices of the shar\u2019i dawawin (such as the Diwan of Judgment and Grievances, the Diwan of Hisbah, and the Diwan of Da\u2019wah) continue to be active and to do their work on the ground, and all praise is due to Allah.\nAllah has blessed us and facilitated for us here in the Hisbah Center to combat many manifestations of corruption, among the most important of which is the smuggling of  cigarettes,  marijuana,  opiates,  and  other  substances. Likewise, we have prohibited the people from committing open sins and wrongs, such as women not wearing proper hijab, men allowing their clothing to fall below their ankles,  and  the  free  intermingling  of  men  and  women, as well as smoking, music, and satellite dishes, [which are used for broadcasting sinful programs].\nOur main focus, however, is to wage war against the manifestations of shirk and bid\u2019ah, including Sufism, sorcery, soothsaying, and grave-worship.\nQuestion:  Due  to  the  major  role  Sufism  plays  in spreading shirk and bid\u2019ah among the people, and due to Sufi tariqas enslaving the people to the tawaghit, Sufism is one of the worst diseases to have afflicted many lands today. Can you tell us about the condition of Sufism in Sinai?\nAnswer:  Sufism  in  Sinai  is  divided  into  two  major tariqas, the \u2018Alawi-Ahmadi tariqah and the Jariri tariqah.The Ahmadi tariqah is widespread in the region of Jurah and its surrounding areas, such as the areas of Shabbanah, Dhahir, and Malafiyyah, and likewise the region of \n12Interview\nArticle\fout of anger for Allah\u2019s sake and as a deterrent for other sodomites.\nAnd what is obligatory upon an individual concerning matters over which the people have differed, is to refer back to the Book and the Sunnah, Allah \uf063 said, \u201cIn anything over which you disagree \u2013 its ruling is [to be referred] to Allah\u201d (Ash-Shura 10). He \uf063 also said, \u201cIf you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger\u201d (An-Nisa 59).\nThe Sunnah has clarified that the default ruling with respect to burning anything with a soul is that it is forbidden, for Abu Hurayrah \uf068 narrated, saying, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 sent us on an expedition, saying, \u2018If you find so-and-so and so-and-so, burn them with fire.\u2019 Then, when we were about to depart, Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u2018I ordered you to burn so-and-so and so-and-so, but none is to punish with fire except Allah. So if you find them, kill them\u2019\u201d (Reported by alBukhari).\nAnd Ibn \u2018Abbas \uf06b narrated that the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cDo not punish with the punishment of Allah\u201d (Reported by alBukhari).\nAs for the \u201cscholars\u201d of the tawaghit and the \u201ctheorists\u201d of the Sahwat turning a blind eye to the evidences, then this was through their concealment of some of that which the Most Just of Judges had revealed for mankind to maintain their affairs justly. He \uf063 said, \u201cIf you punish [an enemy], punish with an equivalent of that with which you were harmed\u201d (AnNahl 126). He \uf063 also said, \u201cFor [all] violations is legal retribution. So whoever has transgressed against you, then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you\u201d (Al-Baqarah 194). He \uf063 also said, \u201cThe retribution for a harmful act is a harmful one like it\u201d (Ash-Shura 40). He \uf063 also said, \u201cFor wounds is legal retribution\u201d (Al-Maidah 45).\nLikewise, regarding the issue of punishing with fire as an act of retribution, there is the hadith of the \u2018Ukliyyin, which was reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Anas Ibn Malik \uf068, who said, \u201cThat a group of 8 people from \u2018Ukl came to Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 and pledged their Islam. They found the land unpleasant, disliked it, and became ill. They complained of that to Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067, so he said, \u2018Would you like to head out with our shepherd and his camels, and drink from their urine and milk?\u2019 They said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 They then headed out, drank the camels\u2019 urine and milk, and recovered. Then they killed the shepherd and drove the camels out, [stealing them]. This then reached Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067, so he sent after them and they were captured and brought back. He then gave the order and their hands and feet were cut off, and he melted their eyes [In one narration: He then called for some nails to be brought. The nails were then heated. And he melted their eyes with them]. They were then cast out and left under the [heat of the] sun, until they died.\u201d\nAnas \uf068 said, \u201cThe Prophet \uf067 only melted their eyes because they melted the shepherds\u2019 eyes\u201d (Reported by Muslim).\nAl-Bukhari named a chapter in his sahih on the hadith of the \u2018Ukliyyin, \u201cChapter: If a Mushrik Burns a Muslim Is He to Be Burned?\u201d Ibn Hajar said, \u201cHe thereby indicated that the prohibition in his statement, \u2018Chapter: The Punishment of Allah Is Not to Be Punished With,\u2019 is specific to when the burning is not done for the sake of retribution\u201d (Fath al-Bari), because the reality of melting a person\u2019s eyes is to burn the \nThe two Turkish apostates in the clutches of the mujahidin\neyes with fire using heated nails as a medium, as was indicated by Ibnul-Muhallab, Ibn Battal, Ibnul-Mulaqqin, and other hadith commentators.\nThus, in these ayat, the Most Just of Judges legislated retribution, and in this hadith, the truthful and trustworthy one \uf067 judged that the eyes of the \u2018Ukliyyin be melted because some of them did the same to the eyes of his shepherd. These evidences attest to the just nature of the flames that the mujahid muwahhidin ignited for the imprisoned soldiers of the Jordanian and Turkish tawaghit. Likewise, the position of the majority of the fuqaha also bears witness to the just nature of these flames.\nAbul-\u2018Abbas  al-Qurtubi  commented  on  the  hadith  reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Anas \uf068, who narrated, saying, \u201cA Jew killed a young girl for the sake of some silver jewelry she had, using a stone. She was brought to the Prophet \uf067 while she still had some life in her [before dying]. He asked her, \u2018Was it so-and-so who killed you?\u2019 So she shook her head, \u2018No.\u2019 Then he asked her about a second person, and she shook her head, \u2018No.\u2019 Then he asked her about a third person, and she nodded her head, \u2018Yes.\u2019 So Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 killed him [by crushing his head] between two stones.\u201d\nAbul-\u2018Abbas Al-Qurtubi said, \u201cTherein is [evidence] that whoever commits murder using something is to likewise be killed by it. There was a difference of opinion on the issue, and the majority hold that he is to be killed with the like of that by which he committed the murder, whether by a stone, a cane, drowning, strangling, etc., as long as he did not commit murder with something entailing fisq, such as sodomy or alcohol, in which case he is to be killed by the sword. Their evidence is this hadith, as well as His \uf063 statement, \u2018So whoever has transgressed against you, then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you\u2019 (Al-Baqarah 194), and His \uf063 statement, \u2018For wounds there is qisas\u2019 (Al-Maidah 45), and the reality of qisas [retribution] is to be equal in deed. And from among these scholars [i.e. the majority] are those who differed when it came to burning with fire or killing him with a cane [i.e. by impaling him through the anus, if he had \n\f", "schema:headline": "Interview\r With the Amir of Hisbah in Sinai", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "11"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah12-Contents", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "12", "schema:articleBody": "CONTENTS\nISSUE 12 - DHUL-QA\u2019DAH 1438\nO MUWAHHIDIN, REJOICE, FOR BY ALLAH, WE  WILL  NOT  REST  FROM  OUR  JIHAD EXCEPT  BENEATH  THE  OLIVE  TREES  OF RUMIYAH ABU HAMZAH AL-MUHAJIR r\n(ROME).\n06\n04\nFOREWORD\nARTICLES\n061018243236\nNEWS\n36\n10\n36\nTHE MUSLIM SOCIETY BETWEEN HUMAN REALITY AND MISLEADING FANTASIES\nA MUJAHID\u2019S MEMORIES FROM THE BATTLE OF MOSUL\nRULINGS RELATED TO GIVING DA\u2019WAH TO THE HARBI KUFFAR\nIMPORTANT ADVICE FOR THE MUJAHIDIN: PART IT WILL BE A FIRE THAT BURNS THE CROSS AND ITS PEOPLE IN RAQQAH\nTHE FEMALE SLAVES OF ALLAH IN THE HOUSES OF ALLAH\nMILITARY AND COVERT OPERATIONS\nCONTENTS\fHere,  we  present  to  you  \u201cA Mujahid\u2019s  Memories  from  the Battle  of  Mosul,\u201d  an  article that  illustrates  the  brutal  war in  the  heart  of  Mosul,  which transformed doctors and medical assistants into soldiers and heroes who were prepared to sacrifice in defense  of  their  religion.\nAs  for  the  Battle  of  Raqqah, the Crusaders and their murtadd proxies  claimed  that  they  are capable  of leading  the  battle without  losing  large  numbers  of soldiers  and  without  sustaining losses  and  defeats.

This society did not stop with the establishment of Allah\u2019s shari\u2019ah and the implementation of the hudud alone. Rather, it was a society that called to good and clarified the path to  forgiveness.\nAnd  in  the  article  titled,  \u201cRulings  Related  to Giving  Da\u2019wah  to  the  Harbi  Kuffar,\u201d  we  clarify matters  related  to  giving  da\u2019wah  to  the  harbi (belligerent) kuffar both before fighting them and during  the  fighting.\n\u201cThe Female Slaves of Allah in the Houses of Allah - Rulings and Etiquettes\u201d is an article that clarifies  what  is  obligatory  for  women  to  know before  they  head  out  to  the  masajid.\nFinally,  we  present  to  you  \u201cImportant  Advice for  the  Mujahidin:  Part  2,\u201d  where  we  mention the  advice  of  Abu  Mus\u2019ab    az-Zarqawi  r  to  the mujahidin  in  Allah\u2019s  cause.\nWe  ask  Allah  to  preserve  all  those\u2013  both  far and near \u2013 who contributed to the success of this issue.\n5Rumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Contents", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "1"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah10-Important-Memorandums", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "The  Delegated  Committee  issued  an  important memo to the soldiers of the Islamic State entitled, \u201cThat Those Who Perish would Perish upon Proof and Those Who Live would Live upon Proof,\u201d which confirms some matters regarding the \u2018aqidah of the Islamic  State  and  its  methodology.

And it clarifies to the Muslims the way of Ahlus-Sunnah in giving advice to those in authority and  dealing  with  grievances  whenever  appear.\nThe memo, which was published on the 21st of Sha\u2019ban 1438, began by explaining that the Islamic State was only established to spread tawhid, and that its da\u2019wah is merely an extension of the da\u2019wah of the Prophets and Messengers \uf070, then that of the righteous Salaf of this ummah and of those who followed their guidance.

As it was mentioned in the Delegated Committee\u2019s memo, \u201cThe State did not change its manhaj. It did not haggle over its religion. And its resolve did not waver. Instead, it continued thereon, not playing favorites nor turning from the path.\u201d And the memo confirmed that the State doesn\u2019t care who is pleased or displeased with it, but that it instead deals with everyone based on its chosen method, just as Shaykh Abu Muhammad al-\u2018Adnani \uf08a said, \u201cWe will fight, and fight, and fight until the religion is entirely for Allah.

Rather, one finds that  many  of  these  are  not  satisfied  with  their  own defeat, but attempt to transfer that defeat to others, spreading it throughout the Muslim collective. They dismay them regarding their enemies, seeking to scare the Muslims and avert them from fighting them and standing up against them.\nThis  is  one  of  the  well-known  deeds  of  the  munafiqin, and it is widespread between those weak in iman  and  lacking  in  conviction,  of  both  men  and women.  As  for  the  matter  of  men,  then  it  is  well known,  and  their  role  has  already  been  thoroughly discussed. And as for women, then the calamity that comes from them is hidden in their transporting this scaremongering from the houses and tongues of the munafiqin to their own houses, and to their husbands and children. Thereby, she falls into committing the deeds of the munafiqin, whether she knows it or not.\nIrjaf is an Act of the Munafiqin\nNews that is untrue and causes fitnah and confusion is called irjaf, or scaremongering. Al-Qurtubi said in his tafsir, \u201cIrjaf is to solicit fitnah and to spread lies \nand falsehoods, causing worry and distress thereby.\u201d\nAllah c has dispraised irjaf and its people in many places in the noble Quran, as He c said, \u201cAllah already knows the hinderers among you and those (hypocrites) who say to their brothers, \u2018Come to us,\u2019 and they do not go to battle, except for a few\u201d (Al-Ahzab 18). He also said, \u201cIf the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease and those who spread rumors in Madinah do not cease, We will surely incite you against them; then they will not remain your neighbors therein except for a little. (They will be) accursed wherever they are found, being seized and massacred completely\u201d  (Al-Ahzab  60-61).\nAl-Jassas said, \u201cIn this ayah, there is evidence that scaring  the  believers  and  spreading  rumors  among them  that  cause  them  worry  and  harm  is  deserving of punishment and exile if they persist in that and do not stop. A group of the munafiqin and others who had no insight in the religion, and they are those in whose hearts is disease, being weak in their certainty, would spread rumors of the kuffar and mushrikin gathering together, cooperating with one another, and marching towards the believers. They would magnify the  kuffar\u2019s  situation  and  scare  others  because  of  it. So Allah c revealed that about them, telling about their deserving exile and execution if they do not stop. And He c explained that this is the sunnah of Allah, which is the way ordained to adhere to and follow\u201d (Ahkam  al-Quran).\nSOME FOOLS WHO STRAYED AND RETURNED TO DAR AL-KUFR BEGAN SPREADING IRJAF\nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Important Memorandums", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "11"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah13-Foreword", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "13", "schema:articleBody": "FOREWORD\nA n  official  from  among  the \nCrusaders  commented  on the matter of their targeting the soldiers of the Islamic State, saying, \u201cThey have entered into war, and they should expect that their deaths will be one of the outcomes.\u201d\nIndeed,  the  statement  that  Allah g  placed  on  the  tongue  of  this  kafir is  a  truth  that  cannot  be  argued, particularly  with  the  soldiers  of  the Islamic State. In fact, the reality is that when  the  mujahidin  proceed  towards battle, death is not just a possibility for them,  it  is  a  wish  that  they  seek  and endeavor  to  attain,  for  death  in  this case is shahadah in the cause of Allah, and through it the believer attains the highest  of  ranks  with  the  Lord  of  the heavens and the earth.\nHowever, it seems that the Crusaders \nhave  yet  to  grasp  the  reality  of  what  was  stated  by  one  of their  officials,  and  for  this  reason  we  find  them  displaying a significant degree of surprise and shock whenever they are attacked in their lands by the soldiers of the Islamic State. It is as if they live in another world altogether, different from the one in which their armies are engaged in a grinding war against  the  army  of  the  Islamic  State,  exerting  their  efforts in order to destroy the lands of Islam and to kill as many of the women and children of the Muslims \u2013 both young and old \u2013 as they can.\nThis  is  not  the  first  time  that  the  Crusader  states  have been led to war by America \u2013 the carrier of the banner of the Cross in this era \u2013 and neither is it the first time that they have paid a heavy price for following their tawaghit in their war against the Muslims.\nWhat  is  apparent  is  that  whenever  the  tawaghit  of  the European  states  dispatch  their  armies  to  fight  and  kill  the Muslims  under  America\u2019s  banner,  they  only  calculate  the gains they will achieve by taking part in that war and forget to gauge the heavy cost they will be forced to pay in order to achieve the gains that they dream of.\nFOREWORD\fJahiliyyah affirmed the oneness of Allah in His Lordship, they negated that affirmation with their indulgence in various  forms  of  shirk  that  run  contrary  to  the  three described aspects of Allah\u2019s tawhid (ar-Rububiyyah, alUluhiyyah, and al-Asma was-Sifat).\nAnd Most of Them Believe Not in Allah Except \nThat They Associate Others with Him\nAllah g informed that if the kuffar were asked, \u201cTo whom belongs the earth and those upon it?\u201d They would answer,  \u201cTo  Allah,\u201d  and  if  they  were  asked,  \u201cWho  is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the great throne?\u201d They would answer, \u201c[They belong] to Allah,\u201d and if they were asked, \u201cWho is it that has the realm of all things in His Hand and who protects while none can protect against Him?\u201d They would answer, \u201c[They belong] to Allah.\u201d But despite that, they would not be reminded, nor would they fear Allah and His torment! And despite their affirmation that Allah g is the Owner of the dominion, the Creator, the Arranger, the Provider, the one who gives life and death, they commit shirk with Him by associating others with Him, while affirming that everything besides Allah is but mere creation. \u2018Abdullah Ibn \u2018Abbas h narrated, saying, \u201cThe mushrikin used to say, \u2018We respond to You, You have no partner,\u2019 and the Messenger of Allah  g would say, \u2018Woe to you, that\u2019s sufficient, that\u2019s sufficient! Then, they would say, \u2018Except a partner who belongs to You, You possess him and all that he owns.\u2019 They would say this as they performed tawaf around the Ka\u2019bah\u201d (Reported by Muslim).\nDespite  the  fact  that  the  mushrikin  used  to  take shelter with Allah in times of difficulty, in times of ease they would return back to what they were accustomed to of committing shirk with Allah. Allah g said, \u201cAnd when they board a ship, they supplicate Allah, sincere to Him in religion. But when He delivers them to the land, at  once  they  associate  others  with  Him\u201d  (Al-\u2019Ankabut 65). They committed shirk with Allah in their worship of others besides Him, calling upon others besides Him who  cannot  bring  harm  nor  benefit,  directing  various forms of worship towards the tawaghit, referring to them in judgement, and inventing against Allah lies with their statement, \u201cWe only worship them that they may bring us nearer to Allah in position\u201d (Az-Zumar 3).\nAllah g sent His messengers and prophets calling to iman in Allah and to dedicating one\u2019s worship exclusively for Him, and to disbelieve in all of the tawaghit, for the iman of mankind and jinn is not complete until they combine  between  these  two  matters:  Iman  in  Allah \nand disbelief in the tawaghit. Allah g said, \u201cAnd We certainly  sent  into  every  nation  a  messenger,  [saying], \u2018Worship Allah and avoid taghut.\u2019 And among them were those whom Allah guided, and among them were those upon whom error was [deservedly] decreed. So proceed through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers\u201d (An-Nahl 36). Therefore, anyone who refuses to dedicate their worship exclusively to Him, or refuses to avoid the tawaghit and disbelieve in them is a misguided denier of Allah\u2019s messengers, and is deserving of Allah\u2019s punishment, which He inflicts upon the disbelievers.\nThe messengers p made it clear that Allah does not accept from His slaves anything except pure Islam and absolute tawhid, and they therefore informed the people that  they  were  not  sent  except  to  ensure  that  Allah  is worshiped  alone,  as  Allah  g  said,  \u201cAnd  We  sent  not before you any messenger except that We revealed to him that, \u2018There is no god except Me, so worship Me\u2019\u201d (AlAnbiya 25), and they informed them that Allah g, \u201cDoes not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills\u201d (An-Nisa 48). And when the kuffar proposed to the Prophet g that they worship Allah for one year in return that he g worship their false gods for one year, Allah g revealed Surat alKafirun, separating between iman and its adherents, and shirk and its adherents. \u201cSay, \u2018O disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship. Nor are you worshipers of what I worship. Nor will I be a worshiper of what you worship. Nor will you be worshipers of what I worship. For you is your religion, and for me is my religion\u2019\u201d (AlKafirun 1-6).\nThe Tawhid of Allah in Hukm (Legislation and \nRule)\nThe  messengers  p  made  clear  to  their  people  that which Allah loves and is pleased with of tawhid, iman, and righteous deeds, while warning them against that which negates this from the various types of kufr, shirk, defiance, and disobedience. And from among that which they made extremely clear was the matter of rule being for  Allah  g.  Therefore,  just  as  Allah  g  is  alone  in creating He is likewise alone in His command. \u201cHis is the creation and the command; blessed is Allah, Lord of the creation\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 54). Additionally, three Makki verses were revealed stipulating that \u201cLegislation is not but for Allah\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 57, Yusuf 40, and Yusuf 67). And despite the fact that the Prophet g and his companions were  oppressed  in  Makkah,  Allah  g  ordered  him  to openly declare that this great religion came from Allah \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Foreword", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah9-They-Took-Their-Scribes-and-Monks-as-Lords-besides-Allah", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "9", "schema:articleBody": "Article\n\fAlhambra, a Muslim fortress in Andalus that fell to the kuffar after the Muslims became divided\none can overcome you; but if He should forsake you, who is there that can aid you after Him?

So  His  Sunnah and His wisdom in the creation is constant. He sends down tribulations whenever He wills and lifts them whenever  He  wills,  knowing  that  nothing  in  the heavens  or  the  earth  can  incapacitate  Him.

It is a scene that resembles the situation of Dar al-Islam in previous times since generations passed and great events raged, leaving an \neffect that could not be erased and a deep wound in the body of the Ummah that would not heal. But it is a lesson from those who preceded and a means of distancing the Muslim jama\u2019ah from a slippery slope and an abyss that may lead them to actual destruction by  stripping  them  of  their  religion,  such  that  they perish  upon  other  than  the  religion  of  Islam.  So here is Crusader America and its allies returning in an  attack  against  Dar  al-Islam  and  the  land  of  the Khilafah, and it has not occurred in history that the nations of kufr gathered with all their religions and creeds,  in  collusion  with  those  falsely  attributing themselves  to  Ahlus-Sunnah,  from  the  murtadd rulers and the evil scholars and callers \u2013 even those claimants to jihad and a sound manhaj \u2013 all of them in one rank with the nations of kufr against the sons of  Islam  in  the  Khilafah  state.  Nevertheless,  the difference between that past period and invasion and what  we  are  experiencing  today  is  that  the  Muslim state of those old times was in the worst of conditions, distant from its religion and its Lord, divided by the kings of the taifas,1  so Allah empowered an enemy that  swept  into  the  homes,  destroying  both  hearth and offspring.

Six months had  passed  and  it  was  \u201cDecember  2013\u201d  when  he told me, \u201cI am confirming to you my allegiance to the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Sham.  I  have  given bay\u2019ah to its amir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi al-Husayni al-Qurashi.  We  are  anticipating  betrayal  from  the other  factions  and  we\u2019re  speculating  a  propaganda war. Jabhat an-Nusrah aren\u2019t what we thought them to be. Dawlah are the true mujahidin. They are not fighting  for  democracy  or  nationalism,  they  are fighting to implement Shari\u2019ah!

However,  on  route  they too were ambushed by the thugs of \u2018Liwa at-Tawhid\u2019. The mujahidin were drawn into a battle and within half an hour my previous husband had been fatally struck  by  a  bullet  in  the  jaw.  The  brothers  swiftly sheltered him away from the enemy\u2019s line of fire and \na few minutes later he had proclaimed his shahadah and returned to his Lord, inshaallah in the heart of a green bird with a lantern hanging from the throne of Allah g.\nThe news was bittersweet. I was so happy for my previous husband \u2013 may Allah accept him \u2013 as Allah g had not denied him his desire to attain shahadah \u2013 we consider him so and Allah is his judge \u2013 but I was anxious because I now had to make hijrah with my children, alone.\nThe Murtaddin Are Exposed and the \nMujahidin Remain True\nIt  was  not  long  before  Allah  g  exposed  the Sahwat.  They  were  allying  with  the  kuffar  and tawaghit,  receiving  funds  and  various  other  forms of assistance. They did not implement the Shari\u2019ah in  any  of  the  places  where  they  had  tamkin (consolidation), nor did they bring peace and security to  the  Muslims.  Rather,  tyranny  and  oppression remained widespread. Meanwhile, the Islamic State had  liberated  Raqqah  and  numerous  other  cities throughout Sham and implemented the Shari\u2019ah in all  their  strongholds.  However,  this  did  not  deter the claimants to Islam and jihad from defaming and belittling  the  mujahidin,  condemning  their  actions in  order  to  appease  the  kuffar,  and  accusing  the Islamic  State  of  hijacking  Islam  when  in  reality  it was those social media-obsessed entertainers we call \u201cscholars\u201d who have hijacked and distorted our pure religion  by  encouraging  voting  in  kufri  elections, embracing  peaceful  co-existence  with  the  kuffar, accepting the rule of the tawaghit, and by other than \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "The Characteristics of the Munafiqin", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "25"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq4", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah1-Stand-and-Die-upon-That-for-Which-Your-Brothers-Died", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "1", "schema:articleBody": "The people of falsehood constantly attempt to make the deaths of righteous men and their slayings by the enemies of Islam \u2013 the mushrikin and the apostates \u2013 into a sign foretelling the breaking of the muwahiddin.

In this decree,  all  people  are  equal,  including prophets and righteous people as well as  disbelievers  and  tyrants.\nThose fools do not realize that Allah \uf063 preserves His religion however He wills, and this religion will remain established and will not be damaged by \nthe death of any person. If it would have  been  damaged  by  anything, it  would  have  been  by  the  death  of the Prophet \uf067 and those of his noble  Companions.  But  the  religion remained  long  after  their  departure, as Allah established its foothold and spread it on the earth. He preserved it and employed His righteous slaves in its service. \u201cHe loves them and they love  Him;  humble  to  the  believers and  mighty  against  the  disbelievers, they  wage  jihad  for  His  cause  and do not fear the blame of any blamer\u201d (Al-Maidah  54).\nAs for the learned who revere Allah as He should be revered, worshiping Him  as  He  should  be  worshiped, when  one  of  the  righteous  from among  them  die,  they  remind  their \n2\fHe \uf072 also said, \u201cThe Islam which is the religion of Allah and for which He revealed His books and sent His messengers \u2026 is that the slave surrenders to Allah, the Lord of the creation, submitting (istislam) to Him alone without making any partners for Him, and becoming exclusively for  Him  (salamah)  such  that  he  takes  Him  as  his  deity without taking other than Him as a deity, as is clarified by the best of speech and the main pillar of Islam, the testimony of \u2018la ilaha illallah.\u2019 And it has two opposites: kibr [haughtiness] and shirk. For this reason, it was reported that Nuh \uf06e ordered his sons with \u2018la ilaha illallah\u2019 and \u2018subhanallah,\u2019 and forbade them from arrogance and shirk (Reported by Ahmad from \u2018Abdullah Ibn \u2018Amr) \u2026 This is because the one who is too haughty to worship Allah does not worship Him and therefore does not submit to Him, and the one who worships Him and also worships other  than  Him  is  making  partners  for  Him  and  he  is therefore not exclusively for Him. Rather, he has shirk towards Him. And the word \u2018Islam\u2019 comprises both istislam and salamah, meaning ikhlas\u201d (Al-Fatawa), \u201cand both the mustakbir [the haughty person who does not worship Allah] and the mushrik are not Muslims\u201d (An-Nubuwwat).\nThus,  a  person  cannot  be  a  Muslim  except  by  adhering to Islam in both of these aspects, so whoever doesn\u2019t submit to Allah \u2013 such as one who abandons all actions or forcefully resists some of the manifest, mutawatir rulings \u2013 is nothing but a kafir, and whoever isn\u2019t exclusively for Allah \u2013 such as one who worships the prophets and the  righteous,  whether  blindly  following  others  or  having misunderstandings \u2013 is nothing but a mushrik, even if he prays, fasts, and claims that he is a Muslim. These realities are manifested by the testimony of \u201cla ilaha illallah.\u201d Abul-\u2018Abbas Ibn Taymiyyah \uf072 said, \u201cThe \u2018ilah\u2019 is the one who is worshiped and obeyed\u201d deserving so (Taysir al-\u2018Aziz al-Hamid), thus there is none deserving worship or  obedience  except  Allah.  This  statement  encompasses the meanings of both salamah and istislam, and it is the da\u2019wah of all the prophets and messengers to their peoples and  nations.\nAbul-\u2018Abbas  Ibn  Taymiyyah  \uf072  said,  \u201cThe  word  \u2018Islam\u2019\u2026has two meanings. The first is the common religion which He sent all the prophets with \u2013 to worship Allah alone, not making any partners for Him \u2013 as the texts of the Book and the Sunnah indicate that their religion was the same. The second meaning is that which Muhammad \uf067 was specified with \u2026 And it (i.e. Islam) has two levels. The first level is those words and deeds manifested externally, and they are the five pillars. The second level is that this  manifestation  conforms  with  one\u2019s  interior\u201d  (Al-Fatawa).\nThese five pillars, which represent the reality of Islam in speech and action, both outward and inward, were clarified by Allah\u2019s messenger \uf067 through his statement, \u201cIslam has been built upon five matters: Testifying that there is no  god  but  Allah  and  that  Muhammad  is  His  messenger, establishing the prayer, giving the zakah, performing hajj to the sacred house, and fasting Ramadan\u201d (Report-\ned by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar). Another narration states, \u201cIslam has been built upon five matters: Making tawhid of Allah\u2026\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Ibn  \u2018Umar).  Another  narration  states,  \u201cIslam  has  been build upon five matters: Worshiping Allah and disbelieving  in  anything  [worshiped]  besides  Him\u2026\u201d  (Reported by Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar). Thus, the Islam with which the Shari\u2019ah of Muhammad \uf067 was specified was not an Islam without salamah and istislam to Allah. Rather, the five pillars were legislated so that the individual could become exclusively for Allah and submit to Him by adhering to tawhid, following the Messenger \uf067, and performing the  pillars.  Ishaq  Ibn  Rahawayh  \uf072  said,  \u201cThe  Murjiah went to extremes to the extent that one of their statements became,  \u2018Whoever  abandons  the  prayer,  the  fast  of  Ramadan, the zakah, the hajj, and abandons all other obligations, without denying their obligatory status, we do not make takfir of him and his matter is deferred to Allah thereafter since he acknowledges [the obligatory status of these  deeds].\u2019  These  are  the  Murjiah  concerning  whom there is no doubt\u201d (Masail Harb al-Kirmani).\nFurthermore,  Allah  has  clarified  the  relationship  between salamah and istislam in many ayat in His book, including His command to fight the mushrikin. He \uf065 said, \u201cBut if they repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, then they are your brothers in religion; and We detail the verses for a people who know\u201d (At-Tawbah 11). After reciting this ayah, al-Fudayl Ibn \u2018Iyad \uf072 said, \u201cAllah \uf062 has made repentance from shirk be both through speech and action, via the establishing of prayer and the offering of zakah. The  people  of  Ray  [those  who  prefer  their  opinions  to many ahadith of the Prophet \uf067] said, \u2018Neither the prayer nor the zakah nor any of the obligatory deeds are from iman,\u2019 thereby fabricating a lie against Allah \uf062 and opposing His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet \uf067.

They  also  made  takfir  of those who withheld the zakah, as they had resisted with force  an  obvious  and  clear-cut  law  of  the  Shari\u2019ah.  The extreme Murjiah opposed them in this (in that there is no Islam without submission), thus they were unaware of the reality of the Islam Allah is pleased with as a religion for the people. Likewise, the Sahabah \uf06a had consensus that there is no Islam without salamah, so they made takfir of the  category  of  apostates  who  went  back  to  worshiping idols  \u2013  and  they  were  idols  that  had  been  made  in  the image forms of the righteous \u2013 and they did not consider any of the following to be impediments for making takfir of the individuals: The peoples\u2019 recent withdrawal from Jahiliyyah, the emergence of liars claiming prophethood, or  the  usurping  of  the  Muslims\u2019  lands  by  the  apostates resisting  zakah  with  force.  The  modern-day  Jahmiyyah opposed them in this, going against the statement of the Messenger  \uf067,  \u201cWhoever  dies  knowing  \u2018la  ilaha  illallah\u2019 \n\f", "schema:headline": "Stand and Die upon That for Which Your Brothers Died", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "1"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah8-Establishing-the-Islamic-State:-Part-2", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "8Article\n\fJust as the blood of the kafir is halal to shed,1 so too is the kafir\u2019s wealth halal to take.

This hadith also shows  the  relationship between fighting and taking wealth, as all kuffar who are not under  the  contract of dhimmah are enemies from whom ghanimah  is  taken.

He then mentioned the order to kill all those who claim partners  for  Allah,  saying,  \u201cSo  when  the  sacred  months have passed, then kill the mushrikin wherever you find \n1\u2002See Rumiyah, issue 1, \u201cThe Kafir\u2019s Blood Is Halal for You, So Shed It.\u201d\nthem.

The battles and carnage burned in various areas of Iraq. Battalions and groups were formed and the  mujahidin  stood  up  in  defiance,  seizing  convoys of the enemy, hunting their patrols, and raiding their positions. And by Allah\u2019s grace, we witnessed many of their losses, which were inflicted all across Iraq. So of the causes of pride of this conquest was that the sons of jihad gained confidence as they saw the myths  of  modern warfare collapsing before  them.  Their resolve has now been liberated from  the illusion  of  inability and  fear,  and  they have  risen  to  the fields  of  earnestness and  action.\nFourth, the Battle of  Fallujah  achieved an important, strategic  military  victory, as everyone knows of the superiority of the American  military machine and the development of its armies and war discipline, which relies on striking targets from afar without clashing and combat,  thereby  securing  the  safety  of  the  American soldier without him being wasted in dangerous battles that could cost him his life. But Fallujah lured this great machine through a carefully managed plan. She lured it to harsh, unconventional street wars that would spend its effort, energy, and equipment. The American soldier would face death and destruction from whence he did not expect, as the Americans were forced to descend into alleys and streets, and to enter houses and buildings. The enemy was exposed to the fires of the mujahidin and their ambushes. Their abilities were taken by surprise through the strategy of attack-and-retreat. They  were  compelled  to  engage  in  close  combat  for which they were unprepared, suffering great losses of life and equipment, exceeding hundreds of people and dozens of vehicles.\nFifth, the American military administration tasted the greatest of defeats, as it became clear to the sponsors and planners of this war that the mujahidin will not be stopped by any kind of deterrent, even if that meant \nwaging a war of total annihilation. For the jihadi mentality has become the greatest dilemma ahead of American and global plans of war. And what happened in Fallujah, of feats of pride and steadfastness, weakened the resolve of the enemy\u2019s leadership and afflicted them with depression, anxiety, and confusion. And what is waiting for them is even more disastrous and bitter, by the help of Allah c.\nTHE AMERICANS LOST HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS IN THE BATTLE OF FALLUJAH\nSixth, Fallujah contributed its share of steadfastness and composure by unveiling the mask from the faces of riddah, nifaq, and treachery. It removed the cloak of deceit worn by the apostate Allawi government, just as it uncovered the lies they repeat about wanting what is  in  the  interest  of  the  Iraqi  people  by  sparing  their blood and shielding them from wars and woes, and that they strive to earn their pleasure. Yet all people can see as they move quickly to execute the decision to go to war in Fallujah, washing their hands in the pure blood of the sons of the city, killing thousands of them and displacing tens of thousands, while overseeing the destruction, devastation, degradation of honor, and theft of wealth under the pretext of being at war with terrorism and having concern for the national interest.\nSeventh, the battle knocked the false mask off the ugly  Rafidi  image.  For  they  penetrated  deeply  with their spite into this battle. And with an apparent vileness, they took part in the military campaign against Fallujah  with  a  blessing  from  the  imam  of  kufr  and zandaqah,  as-Sistani.  They  had  a  major  role  in  operations  of  killing,  pillaging,  demolition,  and  violating \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "But Allah Came Upon Them from Where They Had Not Expected", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5-Front-Cover", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "5", "schema:articleBody": "\ffrom your Lord and do not follow other than Him any allies. Little do you remember\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 3), and, \u201cWhoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers \u2013 We shall leave him in the path he has chosen and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination\u201d (An-Nisa 115), then that is something undesirable to them.\nMuhammad Ibn \u2018Abdil-Wahhab \uf072 described some of their condition, saying, \u201cThey are divided in their religion, just as Allah \uf063 said, \u2018Each faction rejoices in what it has\u2019 (Al-Muminun  53),  and  the  same  goes  for  their  worldly affairs, and they consider that condition to be correct\u2026 Also, opposing the Muslim ruler and not complying with his order is considered a virtue by them, just as they consider hearing and obeying him to be humiliation and degradation\u2026  Also,  their  religion  is  built  upon  some  fundamentals. The most significant of them is taqlid, which is the greatest principle for all of the kuffar \u2013 the first of them  and  the  last  of  them,  as  Allah  \uf063  said,  \u2018Similarly, We did not send before you any warner into a city except that its affluent said, \u2018Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are only following in their footsteps\u2019\u2019 (Az-Zukhruf 23)\u201d (Masail al-Jahiliyyah).\nHe also said, \u201cAllah commanded unity in the religion and forbade being divided therein. He explained this in a conclusive way, which even the common people can understand\u2026 However, being divided in the fundamentals and  branches  of  the  religion  thereafter  became  \u2018knowledge\u2019 and \u2018fiqh\u2019 of the religion, whereas unity in the religion became professed only by a \u2018zindiq\u2019 or a \u2018madman\u2019\u2026 And  part  of  complete  unity  is  hearing  and  obeying  the one appointed over us, even if he were an Abyssinian slave. Allah  explained  this  in  a  conclusive  way  and  in  several manners\u2026 Yet this principle became unknown to most of those who claim knowledge. How then can they act upon it?!\u201d (Al-Usul as-Sittah).\nIndeed, their uniting for the sake of factional and national  partisanship  in  addition  to  their  remaining  upon their shirk and riddah will never increase them in might or power. Instead, it will only increase them in frailty, as a result of the odd mixture of greatly varying creeds and methodologies. This will but increase the disputes within their ranks, as well as their endeavor to betray each other. And Allah does not guide a wrongdoing people.\nThus, whoever wants to hold tightly to the strong rope of Allah, he must repent to Allah and adhere to the religion of Islam and the Muslim Jama\u2019ah until he dies. Otherwise, he will be among the stones in Jahannam and piles of men therein.\nFurthermore, it was reported that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever clings to something is left to it\u201d (Reported by an-Nasai from Abu Hurayrah).\nSulayman  Al  ash-Shaykh  \uf072  said,  \u201cWhoever\u2019s  heart clings to something, in that it relies on it and is hopeful of it, Allah leaves him to that thing. So if the slave clings to his Lord, his God, his Master, his Patron, the Lord and Owner of everything, then he is left to Him, so He will suffice him, protect him, safeguard him, and be his ally \u2013 and what a good ally and supporter He is! This is just as He \uf063 said, \u2018Is not Allah sufficient for His slave?\u2019 (Az-Zu-\nErdogan abandons his Sahwah slaves to the Nusayriyyah\nmar 36). And whoever clings to sorcery and devils, then Allah will leave him to them, and they will destroy him in the Dunya and in the Akhirah. In general, whoever relies on other than Allah, whatever it may be, is left to it and he will see evil in the Dunya and the Akhrirah coming at him from its direction, contrary to his expectance. This is the irreplaceable sunnah and unchangeable work of Allah regarding His slaves, that whoever seeks comfort in other than Him, puts his trust in other than Him, or depends on something created to manage his affairs, then Allah will cause that thing to do the opposite of what he hoped from it. This is known through revelation and experience, and whoever reflects deeply over this and the conditions of the creation will see it clearly\u201d (Taysir al-\u2018Aziz al-Hamid).\nHe also said, \u201cThe act of \u2018clinging\u2019 can be of the heart, through action, or both. That is, one who clings to something with his heart, or clings to something with his heart and action, then he is left to it, meaning Allah leaves him to that thing to which he clung. So whoever attaches himself to Allah, seeks Allah\u2019s aid for his need, takes refuge with Him, and entrusts all of his affairs to Him, then He suffices for him every need, brings close to him what is distant, and makes easy for him what is difficult. And whoever clings to other than Him or relies on his knowledge, his intellect, medicine, or amulets, and depends on his might and power, then Allah leaves him to that and abandons him. This is known through the texts and through experience.

He  sent  His  Prophet with  a  complete,  divine  manhaj  that  encompasses both  religious  and  worldly  matters.  The  Sunnah  is filled with varieties of divine graces which protect the Muslim in body and mind. Allah c says, \u201cThose who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet, whom they find written in what they have of the Torah and the Injil (Gospel). He enjoins upon them what is good and forbids them what is evil and he makes lawful for them the pure things and prohibits for them the impure\u201d (al-A\u2019raf 157). At-Tabari r says, \u201cConcerning His saying, \u2018he makes lawful for them the pure things,\u2019 \nthis refers to what Jahiliyyah used to forbid, including \u2018bahirah,\u2019 \u2018saibah,\u2019 \u2018wasilah,\u2019 and \u2018ham\u2019 (four categories of livestock invented by the mushrikin based on certain traits). \u2018And He prohibits for them the impure,\u2019 and  this  includes  the  meat  of  swine,  riba,  and  that which  they  used  to  make  halal  from  the  foods  and drinks which Allah made haram.\u201d\nHealth Is a Blessing That Many People \nAre Heedless Of\nFrom the greatest of the blessings of Allah c on His creation is the blessing of good health, which none is aware of except those who lose it, and if one loses it he spends everything he owns to cure himself and restore his  health,  according  to  his  ability.  The  Sunnah  has \n30Article\n\fthe testimony that \u201cMuhammad is the Messenger of Allah\u201d comprises the truth that he is a worshiper, not something to be worshiped, and a truthful messenger who does not lie. Instead, he is to be obeyed and followed because he is conveying the message from Allah c. So he m has that status of messenger and of conveyance from Allah, as well as that of judging between people when they have disagreements \u2013 for he does not judge except by the rule of Allah, with his concern for life, family, wealth, and land. And he has no share of  divinity.  Rather,  he  is  the  slave  of  Allah  and  His Messenger, just as Allah c said, \u201cThat when the slave of Allah stood, supplicating Him, they were almost as multitudes against him\u201d (Al-Jinn 19). And he g said, \u201cI am only His slave, so say, \u2018the slave of Allah and His Messenger\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari).\nAmong the consequences of that include properly adhering to him, seeking his judgment in matters of dispute, and rejecting the judgment of all others. (For the hypocrites are those who claim to believe in him while they seek the judgment of others). In this way, the slave shall realize the perfection of tawhid and adherence, ultimately realizing his own complete satisfaction. This is the meaning of the two testimonies. Once this is clear, then the meaning of the ayah is that Allah f) has disapproved of whoever claims to believe in what Allah revealed to His Messenger and to the prophets before him while at the same time wanting to seek judgment for resolving disputes from other than the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. Ibnul-Qayyim  said,  \u201cTaghut  is  whoever  transgresses his limit, as it comes from tughyan, which means surpassing the boundary.\u201d So anyone from whom two opponents seek judgment, while he judges by other than the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger g, then he is a taghut, as he has transgressed his limit. Thereby, everyone who worships something besides Allah is actually worshiping taghut, surpassing the boundary with what he worships and giving worship to what does not deserve it. Such is the case of whoever makes other than Allah and His Messenger g the judge and seeks judgment therefrom in matters  of  dispute.  Included  in  His  saying,  \u201cthose  who claim that they believe,\u201d is the rejection of what they have alleged of having iman. As such, He did not say, \u201cthose who believe,\u201d because if they were truly people of iman, they would not have wanted to seek judgment  from  other  than  Allah  c  and  His  Messenger g, and He would not have said of them, \u201cthose who claim.\u201d This is something mostly only said of one who \nThe taghut International Criminal Court\nfalsely alleges something, as his action negates and opposes what that claim entails. Ibn Kathir said, \u201cThis ayah dispraises whoever deviates from the Book and the Sunnah and seeks judgment from anything else, which is invalid \u2013 and that is what is meant here by \u2018taghut.\u2019\u201d\nHis c saying, \u201cThough they were ordered to disbelieve  therein,\u201d  i.e.  in  taghut,  proves  that  seeking judgment from taghut is contradictory to iman, even opposite to it. So iman is not sound except after disbelieving in taghut and abandoning seeking judgment therefrom. Whoever does not disbelieve in taghut has not believed in Allah.\nHis c saying, \u201cAnd Shaytan wants to lead them far astray,\u201d  means  that  wanting  to  seek  judgment  from other than the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger g is obedience to Shaytan. And he only calls his party to become residents of the Inferno. In this ayah, there is evidence that abandoning seeking judgment from taghut, which is anything other than the Book and the Sunnah, is an obligation, and that the one who seeks judgment therefrom is not a believ-\n\f", "schema:headline": "Being Blessed with Health and Tested with Illness", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "29"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah7-Contents", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "Issue 7\nCONTENTS\nO  muwahhidin,  rejoice,  for  by  Allah, we will not rest from our jihad except beneath  the  olive  trees  of  Rumiyah (Rome).Abu Hamzah al-Muhajir \uf08a\nF o r e w o r d\nE x c l u s i v e\nA r t i c l e s\nN e w s\nCONTENTS\n\flamic State \u2013 and the allies of Shaytan from the murtaddin of the Turkish and Nusayri armies, the Sahwat, the  Rafidi  militias,  and  the  Russian  and  American Crusaders, and their allies from the evil scholars, the claimants of jihad, and the political parties and organizations, has indeed revealed the truth for all to see the nature of these murtaddin who refuse the rule of Shari\u2019ah. These murtaddin of the Turkish army and Sahwah  factions  are  prepared  to  commit  the  same crimes \u2013 or even worse \u2013 as those committed by the Crusaders,  Rafidah,  and  Nusayriyyah  in  their  war against Islam. And their practical hostility to the people of tawhid and the Shari\u2019ah of Islam greatly exceeds their claimed hostility to those Jews, Crusaders, Rafidah, and Nusayriyyah who kill the muwahhidin and violate their women.\nThe city of Bab and its surrounding areas, which the  murtaddin  of  \u201cThe  Euphrates  Shield\u201d  were  unable to breach for more than 100 days, suffered destruction the likes of which no other city in Sham has faced at the hands of the Rafidah and Nusayriyyah, as its Muslim people were killed by the hundreds due to the continuous shelling mutually supported by the mushrikin  and  murtaddin.\nVarious groups of the enemies of Islam joined in assisting in this destruction. They are those who have previously \u2013 and even currently \u2013 shown hostility to one another, like the Sahwah murtaddin and the Rafidi militias, the Turkish army and the Nusayri army, and the American and Russian Crusaders.

They were unconcerned  about  the  partnership  made  with  the Nusayriyyah, the Rafidah, and the Russian Crusaders, in the campaign against Bab, as they found that the only opposition thereto was from the soldiers of the  Islamic  State.  They  even  incited  their  murtadd brethren to participate in \u201cThe Euphrates Shield\u201d in order to appease their taghut masters, and the masters of their masters, the Crusaders.\nThe slaughter of the kuffar in Bab, in which the lions of the Khilafah\u2019s army stood steadfast, as stable as mountains, was a great nuisance to the murtaddin, and not only in loss of life and equipment or as an insult to the reputation of their armies; rather, it truly exposed those who participated and who have claimed to be Muslims, claimed to care about Muslim blood, and claimed to support the Muslims.\nAs such, the steadfastness of the mujahidin, wherever they are, in the face of their enemies \u2013 by Allah\u2019s permission \u2013 will expose their secrets and show their flaws.

Those who are ignorant think that what they are upon is sound knowledge and correctness, but it is the greatest extent of ignorance and corruption.\nBy Allah, how many strongholds of Islam have they destroyed?!  And  how  many  of  its  bastions  have  they uprooted  the  foundations  thereof  and  ruined?!  And how many of its symbols have they erased?! And how many of its raised flags have they left and abandoned?! And how often have they struck at its roots with the pickaxes of doubt in order to uproot it?! And how much have they filled the springheads of its drinking places in order to bury them and cut them off?!\nAnd thus Islam and its people continue to be afflicted and tried by them, and it continues to be hammered by their suspicions \u2013 assault after assault \u2013 as they claim all the while to be righteous reformers\u2026\u201cUnquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not\u201d  (Al-Baqarah  12)\u2026\u201cThey  want  to  extinguish  the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it\u201d (As-Saff 8).\nThey agreed to abandon the revelation, and are united in  their  abandonment  of  seeking  guidance  through it\u2026\u201cBut the people divided their religion among them into sects \u2013 each faction, in what it has, rejoicing\u201d (AlMuminun  53)\u2026\u201cInspiring  to  one  another  decorative speech  in  delusion\u201d  (Al-An\u2019am  112)\u2026and  because of  that,  \u201cthey  have  taken  this  Quran  as  [a  thing] abandoned\u201d (Al-Furqan 30).\nThe attributes of iman are not found in their hearts, so  they  do  not  recognize  them,  and  its  institutions with them have been erased, so they do not maintain them, and its sun has been eclipsed by the gathering of  the  darkness  of  their  opinions  and  ideas,  so  they cannot see it. They do not accept the guidance of Allah which He sent with His Messenger, nor do they give it  any  importance,  nor  do  they  see  any  problem  in abandoning it for the sake of their own opinions and ideas. They have stripped the revealed text from its real status and they separated it from its significance and certain definitiveness, and thus they launched against it a barrage of false doubts, with which they continue to carry out ambush after ambush. It came upon them the way that a guest descends on stingy hosts, and so they received him in a way other than how they should have with  acceptance  and  generosity.  They  received  them from a distance, repelling them away. And they said, \n\u201cYou cannot pass us,\u201d and if that was inevitable, then these  texts  would  only  pass  with  difficulty.  In  order to  repel  these  texts,  they  prepared  a  variety  of  rules principles, and when these texts came upon them, they said, \u201cWhat have we to do with linguistic phenoma that do not bring us any conviction.\u201d Their general masses said,  \u201cSufficient  for  us  is  what  we  found  those  that proceeded  us  upon  from  among  the  late  comers,  for they are more knowledgeable than those predecessors and  more  solid  in  their  methods  of  establishing the  proofs  and  evidences.  They  are  those  who  were overcome by simplicity and the soundness of the heart, while not making time for laying out the foundations of examination. Rather, they dedicated their effort into doing that which was ordered and leaving that which was prohibited. Thus, the way of the late comers is more sound in knowledge and more precise, while the way of the predecessors was more ignorant, yet safer.\u201d\nThus, they made the status of the revealed text of the Quran and the Sunnah like that of the Khalifah in these times \u2013 his name minted on coins and exalted on the pulpits during the khutbah, while the judgment of others is that which is enforced and his judgment is neither heard nor accepted.\n They cloak themselves in the gown of iman, while their  hearts  are  deviated  and  lost,  filled  with  malice and disbelief. Their external is like that of the Ansar (supporters) while their internal is aligned to disbelief.\nTheir tongues are the tongues of the Muslims, while their  hearts  are  the  hearts  of  those  who  transgress against them, and they say, \u201c\u2018We believe in Allah and the Last Day,\u2019 but they are not believers\u201d (Al-Baqarah 8).\nTheir capital is deception and conspiring, and their merchandise  is  lies  and  betrayal.  Their  intellects  are driven  by  worldly  benefits  \u2013  both  the  believers  and disbelievers  are  pleased  with  them  \u2013  while  they  are secure from them both. \u201cThey [think to] deceive Allah and  those  who  believe,  but  they  deceive  not  except themselves and perceive [it] not\u201d (Al-Baqarah 9).\nThe diseases of doubts and desires have consumed their hearts and thus destroyed them, and evil intentions have  overcome  their  ambitions  and  thus  corrupted them. Consequently, their corruption has thrown them into  destruction,  and  the  doctors  are  unable  to  cure them. \u201cIn their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their  disease;  and  for  them  is  a  painful  punishment because they [habitually] used to lie\u201d (Al-Baqarah 10).Whosever  falls  victim  to  the  claws  of  his  own doubts will have his iman torn to pieces, and whosoever \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Important Advice for the Mujahidin", "schema:author": "isis", "schema:pageStart": "21"}][{"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3-Paths-to-Victory-\u2013-Part-2", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "3", "schema:articleBody": "The third cause for victory is listening and obeying  the  emir  and  following  Allah\u2019s  order.  Allah  \uf063 said,  \u201cRemember  the  blessing  of  Allah  upon  you and His covenant which He made with you, when you  said,  \u2018We  hear  and  we  obey\u2019\u201d  (Al-Maidah  7). \u2018Ubadah Ibn as-Samit \uf068 said, \u201cWe gave bay\u2019ah to the Prophet \uf067, pledging to listen and obey in times of delight and dislike, and in times of hardship and ease, and to do so selflessly; and to not dispute the command of those in authority unless we see blatant kufr, concerning which we have proof from Allah\u201d (Reported  by  al-Bukhari  and  Muslim).  Another narration has \u201cpledging to listen and obey in times of liveliness and laziness.\u201d Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 also said, \u201cListen and obey, even if a slave is appointed over you, leading you with the Book of Allah\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Ummul-Husayn). Ibn Hajar said, concerning the ahadith in this chapter, \u201cThe command  for  obedience  is  regarding  every  emir, whether or not he is the Khalifah\u201d (Fath al-Bari).\nThe  Prophet  \uf067  said,  \u201cI  command  you  with five  things  with  which  Allah  commanded  me:  the Jama\u2019ah, listening, obeying, hijrah, and jihad\u201d (Reported by Ahmad and at-Tirmidhi from al-Harith al-Ash\u2019ari).\nI  would  like  to  stress  here  the  matter  of  being truthful when listening and obeying as well as being serious when following Allah\u2019s orders in times of dislike and hardship, for obedience in that which a person likes is a simple matter, by Allah\u2019s help. The thing we warn of the most is disobedience regarding warfare, as we have seen its consequences more than once, and it has always been a cause for many woes.An example of this is the story of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 with the army of the Sahabah at Uhud. He specified the position of each troop unit, placing the archers in a location from where they could watch their brothers\u2019 backs and defend them from any enemy attempt to encircle them or any potential advance on them. He said to the archers with complete  clarity,  \u201cWatch  our  backs.  If  you  see  us being killed, do not come to support us, and if you see us retrieving ghanimah, do not come to partake in doing so with us.\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from Ibn \u2018Abbas)  But  the  archers  did  not  heed  the  order  of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067, so the outcome was a retreat for the Muslims and a great massacre, all because of a segment of the army disobeyed the sincere order of their commander and his warning to them.\n20Article\nThis shows that military disobedience has a quick result, and any soldier\u2019s lone ijtihad [personal judgment] that opposes the ijtihad of the emir \u2013 even if it apparently seems good and right \u2013 is a big mistake, opening a great door for evil. Instead, the soldier worships Allah by obeying his emir, as long as he does not order him with a shar\u2019i disobedience.As for ijtihad regarding military action, then such is the sole right of the emir, and it is not appropriate for anyone to go against him except by way of giving advice. It is as the precept goes, \u201cThe leader\u2019s opinion, that which concerns his responsibility as leader, is not negated by the opinion of individual Muslims\u201d (Ibn Muflih: Kitab al-Furu\u2019).\nLook, O slave of Allah, at the blessing found in listening and obeying in times of hardship and difficulty. An example of this is when Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 gave orders to the wounded Muslims at Uhud to fight, despite their pains and wounds, when he knew that Abu Sufyan sought to return to finish off those who remained of the Muslim army. The Muslims responded in obedience to Allah and His Messenger [and thus, Abu Sufyan\u2019s plot failed]. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cThose who responded to Allah and the Messenger after injury had struck them, for those who did good among them and feared Allah is a great reward\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 172).\nSuch was their exact condition when they came back from the Battle of al-Ahzab. Though they were looking forward to comfort after their worry was lifted and were enjoying the blessing of security and had not yet shook off the dust from the  lengthy  siege,  the  order  came  for  another  battle  to  be waged at once. \u201cNo one is to pray \u2018Asr except after reaching Bani Quraydhah\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from \nArticle\fnafiqin  and  the  sick-hearted  have  doubt  and,  therefore, mock and attack the promise of Allah and His Messenger \uf067, while the kuffar and tawaghit are deluded by their power and arrogance, \u201cthinking of Allah other than the truth \u2013 the thought of Jahiliyyah\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 154) and the thought of evil, that the Almighty and Wise \uf063 would abandon His religion and His allies, rather, that He would even make His enemies and their word triumph until all the religion is forever for other than Him \u2013 and Allah is exalted far above the thoughts of the ignorant. Rather, Allah is merely luring them forth from where they do not know, such that they work diligently to actualize Allah\u2019s plot and their future punishment, thereby \u201cruining their houses by their [own] hands and the hands of the believers. So take warning, O people of vision\u201d (Al-Hashr 2).\nIn this regard, the cross-worshipers and their allies (the Turks and the Sahwat) mobilized in the northern countryside of Halab, declaring Dabiq their main goal and claiming that if they were to defile it with their filthy feet and banners,  it  would  be  a  tremendous  psychological  victory over the Islamic State, thinking that the soldiers of the Islamic State couldn\u2019t distinguish between the minor battle of Dabiq and the Major Malhamah1 of Dabiq, and accordingly, if the Islamic State were to withdraw from Dabiq, it would not be the bearer of the Prophet\u2019s victorious banner in the major malahim before the Hour, and thus, after the withdrawal, the soldiers of the Khilafah would abandon it in multitudes.\nBut the cross-worshipers and their murtadd allies did not know \u2013 and how could they possibly know \u2013 that the Major Malhamah of Dabiq will be preceded by great events from the minor signs of the Hour, events the believers performing  ribat  in  their  trenches  know.  They  are  events  of which the truthful, trustworthy prophet \uf067 informed in the ahadith of the tribulations, the malahim, and the signs of the Hour.\nThe Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cThe Hour will not be established until the Romans camp in A\u2019maq or Dabiq. An army from the city [or \u2018from Madinah\u2019] \u2013 from among the best people of earth that day \u2013 will head out to them. When they form ranks, the Romans will say, \u2018Leave us and those who were enslaved from amongst us [or \u2018those who enslaved some of our people\u2019] so we can fight them.\u2019 The Muslims will say, \u2018No, by Allah, we will not abandon our brothers to you.\u2019 So they will fight them. Then one third of the army will flee; Allah will never forgive them. One third of them will be killed; they will be the best of the shuhada with Allah. And one third will conquer them; they will never be afflicted with fitnah. Then they will conquer Constantinople. While they are dividing the ghanimah, having hung their swords on olive trees, Shaytan will shout, \u2018The Dajjal has gone after your families!\u2019 So they will leave, but Shaytan\u2019s claim will be false. When they arrive in Sham, the Dajjal will emerge. Then,  as  they  are  preparing  for  battle  and  forming  their ranks, the prayer will be called. So \u2018Isa Ibn Maryam \uf06e will \n1   Malhamah is the singular of malahim, which are the bloody battles that occur before the Hour. They are described in several ahadith of the Prophet \uf067. See, for example, \u201cKitab al-Fitan wa Ashrat asSa\u2019ah\u201d (The Book of Ordeals and the Portents of the Hour) in \u201cSahih Muslim.\u201d\ndescend and lead them. When the enemy of Allah sees him, he will dissolve just as salt dissolves in water. If \u2018Isa were to leave him, the Dajjal would continue to dissolve until perishing, but \u2018Isa himself kills the Dajjal and then shows them his blood on his [\u2018Isa\u2019s] spear\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah).\nYusayr Ibn Jabir reported that Ibn Mas\u2019ud \uf068 said, \u201cIndeed, the Hour will not be established until the people stop dividing inheritance and rejoicing over ghanimah.\u201d Then he said, while pointing towards Sham, \u201cAn enemy will muster strength against the Muslims and the Muslims will muster strength against them.\u201d Yusayr Ibn Jabir asked him, \u201cYou mean the Romans?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, and there will be a severe rout and the Muslims will prepare a detachment to fight to the death and to not return except victorious. They will fight until night intervenes between them; both sides will return without being victorious and the detachment will be wiped out. The Muslims will again prepare a detachment to fight to the death and to not return except victorious. They will fight until night comes upon them; both sides will return without being victorious and the detachment will be wiped out. The Muslims will again prepare a detachment to fight to the death and to not return except victorious. They will fight until night comes upon them; both sides will  return  without  being  victorious  and  the  detachment will be wiped out. When it is the fourth day, the remaining Muslims will rise and advance towards them, and Allah will decree that the enemy be defeated. They will fight a battle the likes of which will never be seen [or \u2018which has never been seen\u2019], such that a bird would pass their flanks and fall down dead before reaching the end of them. [After the battle,] they would count those related to one another and find that after being one hundred relatives in number, only one man among them is left. So what joy would there be in any ghanimah, and what inheritance could be divided? While they are in that state, they will hear of a calamity worse than this, for a cry will reach them that the Dajjal has gone after their families, who were left behind. So they will throw aside what is in their hands and go forth, sending ten horsemen as a vanguard. Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u2018I know their names and the names of their fathers and the colors of their horses. They will be the best [or \u2018amongst the best\u2019] horsemen on the face of the earth that day\u2019\u201d (Reported by Muslim).\nThe Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cCount six things before the Hour: My death, then the conquest of Jerusalem, then a severe death that will afflict you like the disease that afflicts sheep [causing them to die suddenly after their noses run with something], then the spread of wealth to the extent that a man will be given one hundred dinars and will still be angry, then a fitnah which does not leave the home of any Arab except that it enters it, then a truce that will take place between you and the Romans, following which they will betray it and then come to you under eighty banners, with twelve thousand men under each banner\u201d (Reported by alBukhari from \u2018Awf Ibn Malik).\nThe Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cYou will have a treaty of security with the Romans and then you both will fight an enemy beyond [both of] you. You will be victorious, acquire ghanimah, not suffer any losses, settle, and then depart.

Ibn Qutaybah said, \u201cWith regards to his statement, \u2018no rahbaniyyah,\u2019 he means the deeds of monks, which entails continuous fasting, the wearing of coarse robes, the abandonment of eating meat, and the likes of such deeds\u2026 And with regards to his statement, \u2018and no tabattul,\u2019 he means the abandonment of marriage\u201d (Gharib al-Hadith).\nIbnul-Anbari said, \u201cA rahib [monk] practicing tabattul is one who is cut off from others in devotion to Allah \uf066 and has abandoned marriage.\u201d He then mentioned the hadith of Tawus, and then said, \u201cRahbaniyyah is to remain in the monasteries and abandon eating meat\u201d (az-Zahir).\nThe definition by the linguistic imams is likewise supported by some of the athar of the Salaf, including, \u201cThe siyahah of this ummah is fasting\u201d (Reported by at-Tabari from \u2018Aishah), and likewise \u201c\u2018As-Saihun\u2019 (At-Tawbah 112)\u2019 are the fasting men,\u201d and \u201c\u2018Saihat\u2019 (At-Tahrim 5) are fasting women\u201d (Both reported by at-Tabari from a number of the Salaf).\nknights of the day, and they are \u201ca multitude from the former peoples and a few from the latter peoples\u201d (Al-Waqi\u2019ah 13-14).\nIbn Qutaybah said, \u201cThe original meaning of \u2018saih\u2019 is one who travels in the land\u2026and the one who is a saih in the land abstains from his desires, so the fasting person was likened to him due to his withholding from food, drink, and intercourse during his fast\u201d (Gharib  al-Quran).\nLikewise, at-Tabari \uf072 stated in his tafsir, \u201cSome of the scholars of the Arabic language would say, \u2018We view that the fasting person was called a saih because the saih has no provisions with him and simply eats wherever he finds food, so it is as if it was taken from that.\u2019\u201d\nAlso from among these athar is the following narration, that Sufyan Ibn \u2018Uyaynah \uf072 said, \u201c\u2018Amr narrated to us that he heard Wahb Ibn Munabbih saying, \u2018Siyahah was present in Bani Israil\u2026\u2019\u201d Ibn \u2018Uyaynah commented, \u201cIf one abandons food, drink, and women, he is a saih\u201d (Reported by at-Tabari).\nLikewise,  al-Marwazi \uf072  (died  294AH)  said,  \u201cIshaq  Ibn  Suwayd [a Tabi\u2019i who died in 131AH] said, \u2018They [meaning the Salaf] viewed  siyahah  to  be  fasting  the  day  and  spending  the  night  in prayer\u2019\u201d  (Mukhtasar  Qiyam  al-Layl).\nAfter all this, it becomes undoubtedly clear that what is intended by \u201cThe sihayah of my ummah is jihad\u201d is the prohibition of the innovated siyahah of monks and what it entails of claiming tawak-\nkul and zuhd by abandoning provisions while traveling and by forsaking marriage, food, meat, and sleep \u2013 and this is a practice that some of the deviant Sufi tariqas inherited from the kafir Jews and Christians. What is also intended by it is guidance to that which is better than the innovated siyahah, to jihad for Allah\u2019s cause and what it entails of striving in worship and in seeking to meet Allah \uf063. This is bearing in mind that some of the Salaf held the alternative to siyahah to be i\u2019tikaf, the night prayer, fasting, or seeking knowledge. Also among them are those who held the alternative to be hijrah, which was paired with jihad in the Quran and the Sunnah. \u2018Abdur-Rahman Ibn Zayd Ibn Aslam \uf072 (died 182AH) stated, concerning the tafsir of Allah\u2019s \uf063 statement, \u201cAs-Saihun,\u201d and His \uf063 statement, \u201cSaihat,\u201d \u201cThere is neither in the Quran nor for the ummah of Muhammad any siyahah except for hijrah\u201d (Reported by at-Tabari). He also said, \u201cTheir siyahah was the hijrah they performed when they made hijrah to Madinah\u201d (Reported by Ibn Abi Hatim).\nTherefore, whoever wishes to be from among those who practice the siyahah of the Sunnah, as understood by the Salaf, must perform hijrah and jihad, must strive against himself for Allah\u2019s sake by adhering to zuhd and dhikr in the course of his ribat and combat as much as he can, and must abandon what Allah dislikes of wrongs and  sins,  both  hidden  and  manifest,  including  pride,  arrogance, backbiting, slander, and fighting for the sake of attaining booty or achieving fame.\nTo conclude, with regards to the tafsir of Allah\u2019s \uf063 statement, \u201cIndeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties [in exchange] for that they will have Jannah. They fight for Allah\u2019s cause, so they kill and are killed. [It is] a true promise [binding]  upon  Him  in  the  Tawrah,  the  Injil,  and  the  Quran. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah? So rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted. And it is that which is the great attainment. [Such believers are] the repentant, the saihun\u2026\u201d (At-Tawbah 111-112), Ibnul-Qayyim \uf072 said, \u201cSiyahah has been interpreted as fasting, and it\u2019s been interpreted as traveling to seek knowledge, and it\u2019s been interpreted as jihad, and it\u2019s been interpreted as adhering to obedience. The reality is that it is the siyahah [journey] of the heart in remembering Allah, loving Him, turning to Him in repentance, and longing to meet Him, and all of the aforementioned deeds follow as a result. For this reason, Allah \uf063 described those new wives who would have replaced the wives of the Prophet \uf067 had he divorced the old ones as being saihat, but their siyahah is neither jihad, nor traveling to seek knowledge, nor continuously fasting. It is but the sihayah of their hearts in loving Allah, fearing Him, turning to Him in repentance, and remembering Him. Consider how Allah \uf063 paired between repentance and worship. The first is to abandon what He dislikes, and the second is to do what He loves. Likewise, hamd [praise] and siyahah are paired together. The first is to praise Him with His attributes of perfection and with the siyahah of the tongue in the best of His dhikr, and the second is the siyahah of the heart in loving Him, remembering Him, and venerating Him, just as Allah \uf063 paired between worship and siyahah in the description of the wives, for the first is to worship Him by the limbs and the second is to worship Him by the heart\u201d (Hadi al-Arwah).\nAllah knows best. May Allah send blessings and peace upon the truthful, trustworthy prophet and messenger, and upon his good and pure wives and family.\n\f", "schema:headline": "The Flames of Justice", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "15"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah10-The-Murtadd-Taliban-Movement", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "The nationalist Taliban movement repeatedly strove to reassure the mushrikin in the nations surrounding Afghanistan by declaring their respect for their kafir systems of rule and their devotion to friendly relations with them.

We praise Him and seek His help. Whomsoever Allah guides there is none to misguide, and whomsoever Allah leaves to stray there is none to guide. I testify that there is no god except Allah alone, who has no partner, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger \uf067. As for what follows:\nThe purpose of this series is to clarify the reality of Islam and the necessity of the Jama\u2019ah. We ask Allah to grant both us and you understanding of Islam and to keep us firm in the Jama\u2019ah of the Muslims.\nAllah \uf065 said, \u201cThis day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved Islam as the religion for you\u201d (Al-Maidah 3). He \uf065 also said, \u201cIndeed, the religion with Allah is Islam\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 19). He \uf065 also said, \u201cAnd whoever desires other than Islam as a religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 85).\nThus, the religion which Allah is pleased with for the people  and  other  than  which  He  does  not  accept  from them is Islam. Its reality, both linguistically and religiously, is: salamah, meaning ikhlas, and istislam to Allah, meaning submission to Him.\nAbul-\u2018Abbas Ibn Taymiyyah \uf072 said, \u201cIslam is to submit to Allah alone, and the term Islam encompasses istislam (submission) as well as having ikhlas (sincerity) in this istislam to Allah \u2026 So whoever does not submit to Him is not a Muslim, and whoever submits to other than Him the same as he submits to Him is not a Muslim, and whoever submits to Him alone is a Muslim, as in the Quran, \u2018Yes [on the contrary], whoever submits his face in Islam to Allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve\u2019 (Al-Baqarah 112). He also said, \u2018And who is better in religion than one who submits himself to Allah while being a doer of good and follows the religion of Ibrahim, inclining toward truth? And Allah took Ibrahim as an intimate friend\u2019 (An-Nisa 125)\u201d (An-Nubuwwat).\n4\flishing Allah\u2019s law among the people, implementing the hudud,  and  holding  the  people  back  from  committing transgression, they are prevented from doing injustice to one  another.  Within  this  framework,  the  Islamic  State established various bodies responsible for preventing the people from wronging one another and for eliminating injustice when it occurs from any individual or any party, and from among these bodies is the Central Office for Investigating  Grievances.\nQuestion:  What are the other bodies in the Islamic State that oversee the prevention of wrongdoing and the elimination of injustice among the people?\nAnswer: The basic principle concerning this matter is that supporting one who has been wronged and taking the wrongdoer to account \u2013 even if he is a Muslim \u2013 is a crucial duty compulsory on every Muslim, as the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cCome to your brother\u2019s aid whether he is the wronged one or the wrongdoer.\u201d A man asked, \u201cO Messenger of Allah, I will come to his aid if he is wronged, but if he is the wrongdoer how can I come to his aid?\u201d He said, \u201cBy obstructing him or preventing him from doing injustice, for to do so is to come to his aid\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Anas). This duty becomes even more compulsory when it comes to the soldiers of the Islamic State,  given  the  trust  which  the  leaders  have  burdened them to carry in this regard. The duty of the soldiers is in assisting their brothers in doing their job, those brothers who\u2019ve been tasked with investigating grievances.\nDue to the importance of preventing injustice, it\u2019s become necessary for there to be designated bodies tasked solely with handling this issue. As such, the Islamic State \u2013 by Allah\u2019s grace alone \u2013 established offices for grievances which fall under the Diwan of Judgment and Grievances, as well as offices for grievances in all the wilayat of the Islamic State which are under the direct administration of the offices of the wulat (plural of wali) such that the cases connected to the soldiers and leaders under the wali\u2019s authority will reach them. Likewise, the Central Office for Investigating Grievances was established as an independent body specifically tasked with handling this issue. All of these bodies work together to investigate cases in which there is a sense of injustice, and to continue following up on them until the injustice \u2013 if it exists \u2013 is eliminated.\nQuestion:  What  is  the  purpose  of  having  multiple \nbodies  for  tracking  cases  of  injustice?\nAnswer: The Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cEvery one of you is a shepherd and every one of you is responsible for his flock\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar). It is obligatory on anyone who has been entrusted by Allah \nwith  anything  of  the  affairs  of  the  Muslims  to  prevent those he is responsible for from suffering injustice, and if it reaches him that this has occurred, he must endeavor to remove the injustice from them.\nFor this reason, there are multiple bodies in the Islamic State responsible for eliminating injustice, such that the subjects and soldiers of the Islamic State in the wilayat are able to lodge complaints with the wulat against the soldiers and leaders under their authority, and that people who have cases in the courts are able to lodge complaints with the Diwan of Judgment against the judges\u2019 rulings so that their rulings can be reviewed, and that the Muslims in general who are residing in Dar al-Islam can lodge complaints  against  the  wulat  themselves  or  against  the heads of the dawawin and the military leaders, or lodge complaints  about  the  administrative  procedures  in  the various dawawin with the Delegated Committee, which is the body that has tasked the Central Office for Investigating Grievances with this mission.\nIn  this  manner,  we  would  have  \u2013  by  Allah\u2019s  permission  \u2013  made  effort  to  open  the  door  for  the  people  to put forth their grievances against any individual or body in the Islamic State, and removed any factors preventing their cases from being resolved under the pretext that the body with whom cases are lodged is not responsible for investigating them, or that no one has any power over the accused  party.\nQuestion: What are the procedures the office follows \nwhen tracking cases that have been referred to it?\nAnswer: Once we\u2019ve received a case and registered it, if there is a sense that injustice might have occurred in the case based on the complainant\u2019s claims, we investigate the case, otherwise we dismiss it immediately.\nThe  case  is  then  examined,  and  if  it  has  to  do  with someone under the authority of the wulat or the heads of the dawawin, it is transferred to them to investigate and report the results of the investigation to the office so they can re-assess the case. If the investigation meets all the  requirements  and  the  judgment  is  appropriate,  the judgment is then validated, and if the investigation is deficient or the judgment in the case is inappropriate, it is transferred back to them for re-examination and our role at this point is to track the case on a continuous basis to ensure that it is re-examined and quickly resolved.\nIf, however, the case has to do with one of the wulat or one of the heads of the dawawin, or is against one of the Islamic State\u2019s departments, we take up the matter and summon the accused or one of their representatives in order to investigate the case and listen to their defense con-\n\f", "schema:headline": "The Religion of Islam and the Jama\u2019ah of the Muslims", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5-Paths-to-Victory:-Part-3", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "5", "schema:articleBody": "The  fifth  path  to  victory  is  preparation. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cPrepare for them whatever you can of strength\u201d (Al-Anfal 60). The author of \u201cAdwa al-Bayan\u201d said, \u201cThis is a decisive order for preparing as much strength as possible, no matter  how  advanced  the  means  of  strength become.  Thus,  this  is  a  decisive  order  to adjust with the development of worldly affairs in this regards.\u201d\nIt  is  known  that  waging  jihad  today  is fard \u2018ayn upon every Muslim. And whatever is  required  for  an  obligation  to  be  fulfilled is  itself  an  obligation.  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  \uf067 said, \u201cShoot, O Bani Isma\u2019il, for indeed your father was a shooter\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Salamah Ibn al-Akwa\u2019). And he \uf067 said, \u201cIndeed  strength  is  shooting\u201d  (Reported  by Muslim from \u2018Uqbah Ibn \u2018Amir). As-San\u2019ani said in his commentary on the previous hadith, \u201cThis hadith explains the \u2018strength\u2019 mentioned in the ayah, that it means \u2018shooting arrows,\u2019 as that is what was customary during the life of  the  Prophet.  This  includes  shooting  rifles against the mushrikin and the bughat\u201d (Subul as-Salam). In short, making preparations for the  current  battle  against  the  Crusader  and murtadd enemies is an obligation upon every Muslim who is obliged to perform jihad.\nHere, I will mention some points:First  is  what  Abu  Ja\u2019far  at-Tabari  \uf072 mentioned  in  his  tafsir  of  His  \uf063  saying, \u201cWhatever  you  can  of  strength.\u201d  He  said, \u201cWhat you are capable of preparing for them of weaponry that will be a means of strength for  you  against  them\u201d  (Jami\u2019  al-Bayan). Accordingly, producing weapons is one of the greatest aids to waging jihad for Allah\u2019s cause. Today,  this  production  is  called  the  \u201cwar industry.\u201d  Allah  mentioned  this  industry  in more than one place in His book. Indeed, He was very precise when He \uf063 said, \u201cWe taught him  the  making  of  labus  for  you,  to  fortify you against your [enemy in] war. So will you be  grateful?\u201d  (Al-Anbiya  80).  At-Tabari  \uf072 said, \u201cLabus, according to the Arabs, is every \nform of arms, be it a coat of armor, breastplate, sword, or spear.\u201d  Ibn  Kathir  said,  \u201c[Allah  taught  him]  how  to  make coats  of  armor.\u201d\nThe Lord of might mentioned the description of armor, saying,  \u201cMake  full  coats  of  mail,  and  measure  the  links\u201d (Saba 11), meaning long and wide coats of armor. As for, \u201cAnd  measure  the  links,\u201d  the  author  of  \u201cAdwa  al-Bayan\u201d said, \u201cMeaning make the links and nails, when producing coats  of  mail,  using  appropriate  measures.\u201d\nIbn  Kathir  reported  from  Qatadah  that  coats  of  armor used to be smooth, like sheets, and Dawud was the first to make them with links.\nThis  shows  the  divine  attention  given  regarding  the manufacturing of armor, to the point that Allah mentioned its finer details and then reminded His slaves of this great favor, saying, \u201cSo will you be grateful?\u201d Unfortunately, many of the mujahidin, if not most of them, are unconcerned with this  in  our  war  against  our  enemy.  This,  despite  its  many benefits,  the  most  significant  being  the  protection  of  the mujahid\u2019s life \u2013 which is the dearest thing to us \u2013 against enemy  bullets  and  bomb  fragments.\nA  second  benefit  is  the  securing  of  the  mujahid  from being  injured  in  critical  areas,  which  would  hinder  him from continuing the jihad or make him lose consciousness, thus remaining on the battlefield thereafter, exposing him to being  taken  prisoner  by  the  enemies.\nA  third  benefit  is  that  the  mujahid  is  thereby  aided  in reaching  the  points  closest  to  the  enemy.  This  especially applies  to  the  heroes  who  storm  enemy  positions  and  the lions  of  istishhadi  operations.\nArticle\fcorruption (and even issuing fatawa permitting shirk for the sake of some so-called benefit), many people then believed in the tawaghit, became their allies, entered their religion, and even became their soldiers. The reason for this apostasy was that the evil \u201cscholars\u201d concealed the truth and mixed it with falsehood.\nIn this regards, one who looks to the Arabian Peninsula will find that the Saudi tawaghit did not dare to manifest much of their kufr and corruption and were not followed in apostasy by a party of the people except due to the committee of senior agents,2 Ibn Baz, Ibn \u2018Uthaymin, al-Fawzan, the contemporary Al ash-Shaykh, and their likes. This was due to these \u201cscholars\u201d concealing the truth and not clarifying the condition of Al Salul to the people. Rather, they added to the deception by describing them as \u201cwulat al-amr\u201d (people of authority) and claimed that they were the rightful rulers!Likewise, they concealed from the people the ruling on the taghuti legislative decrees, the ruling on establishing Crusader military bases in the land, and the ruling on permitting riba. As a result, many people foolishly followed the tawaghit, deviating and apostatizing thereby. These \u201cscholars\u201d therefore have a share in the evils committed by those who have followed them, without the evils of those followers diminishing at all.\nThis is the same case in Egypt, as the reason for the people\u2019s deviance and their following of Hosni Mubarak and Sisi thereafter is the \u201cscholars\u201d of al-Azhar and the claimants to Salafiyyah. Likewise, the reason for the people entering into the shirk of parliaments and elections is the tawaghit of the Murtadd Brotherhood and the Party of Darkness.3 We find this scenario repeated in all other lands.\nAltering and Distorting the Law\nFrom among the traits of the evil \u201cscholars\u201d is that they alter and distort the law \u2013 if they are unable to completely conceal it \u2013 by giving corrupt interpretations of the shar\u2019i texts and diverting theses texts from their true meanings to false meanings, just as Allah \uf063 said about the Jews, \u201c[They] distort words from their [proper] usages\u201d (An-Nisa 46). They then attribute their distortions and false interpretations to Allah \uf063, just as the Jews did before them; Allah \uf063 said, \u201cIndeed, there is among them a party who alter the Scripture with their tongues so you may think it is from the Scripture, but it is not from the Scripture. And they say, \u2018This is from Allah,\u2019 but it is not from Allah. And they speak lies about Allah while they know\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 78).\nAs to the shar\u2019i texts ordering jihad, the evil \u201cscholars\u201d persisted in changing their combat-related meaning to other meanings, in order to divert people from fighting the kuffar and the murtaddin. On top of that, they innovated meanings for jihad, meanings for which Allah had not sent down any authority and which even contradict the reality of jihad, such as their claim that jihad is to enlist in the armies of the tawaghit, or to engage in the shirki democratic process in order to compete with the secularists in claiming for oneself Al-\n2   A reference to the apostate \u201cCommittee of Senior Scholars\u201d in so-called  \u201cSaudi  Arabia.\u201d\n3    A reference to the apostate \u201cHizb an-Nur\u201d party in Egypt.\nOne of the taghut \u201cscholars\u201d waiting to be slaughtered \nlah\u2019s right to rule and legislate, or to do other deeds that take one out of the religion, deeds which these cursed \u201cscholars\u201d attempt to associate with the pinnacle of Islam, jihad.\nLikewise, with respect to the shar\u2019i texts that contain the order to openly declare the truth, the evil \u201cscholars\u201d have resorted to nullifying them and not abiding by them, claiming that Allah commands so! They used as evidence His \uf063 statement, \u201cDo not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction\u201d (Al-Baqarah 195). This is despite the fact that what is intended by \u201cdestruction\u201d is the abandonment of jihad, as the companion Abu Ayyub al-Ansari \uf068 clarified when he said, \u201cThrowing ourselves into destruction is by attending to our wealth, amending it, and abandoning jihad\u201d (Reported by Abu Dawud). Thus, how ugly the evil \u201cscholars\u201d are and how ugly their deception is!\nAverting People from Allah\u2019s Path\nIndeed, the evil \u201cscholar,\u201d by treading the path of deviance, fervently endeavors to swerve the people onto his path and avert them from the path of truth, since he fears that his deeds would contradict his statements if he were to manifest the shar\u2019i texts for the people without deception and deceit. He resorts to distortion and to twisting the meanings of the texts so that the matter can be in accordance with his condition and in agreement with his desires. For this reason, you find him averting the youth from jihad, because he inclines towards  the  Dunya  and  is  afflicted  with  the  condition  of sitting back from jihad. And because he is afraid of openly declaring the truth, you see him dressing the truth with falsehood, making this the basis of his da\u2019wah, and claiming it to be the essence of \u201cwisdom\u201d and \u201ccunning.\u201d So he neither manifests the truth nor suffices in concealing it. Rather, he deceives, distorts, dodges, and deludes, and speaks about Allah without knowledge, in order to avert people from Allah\u2019s \n\f", "schema:headline": "Paths to Victory: Part 3", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "21"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah7", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah6", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah6-Examples-of-the-Sahaba's-Eagerness-to-Attain-Shahadah", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "6", "schema:articleBody": "The first forerunners from among the Muhajirin and the Ansar knew that Jannah was Allah\u2019s precious commodity,  and  also  knew  that  none  would  be  able  to pay its price except one who rolled up his sleeves for difficult work. So they searched for every path to Allah\u2019s pleasure so that they could attain it, while asking Allah for facilitation and acceptance.\nThus, you would see them resolving to engage in trade with Allah, selling their lives and wealth so that He would purchase them. \u201cO you who have believed, shall I guide you to a transaction that will save you from  a  painful  punishment?

That is the great attainment\u201d (As-Saff 10-12).When they recognized that the quickest path leading to it is shahadah for the cause of Allah, they descended onto the battlefields, advancing forward and not retreating, hastening, proceeding towards death, and taking it as a means to attaining life.\nAnas Ibn an-Nadr \uf068 Storms the Mushrikin on \nthe Day of Uhud\nHere we have Anas Ibn an-Nadr \uf068, who was absent from the Battle of Badr and was extremely upset as a result. However, he swore an oath and made a promise, so let us listen to his nephew Anas Ibn Malik as he tells us about his uncle\u2019s deed. He said, \u201cMy uncle, Anas Ibn an-Nadr, was absent from the fight-\ning at Badr, so he said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, I was absent from the first battle in which you fought the mushrikin. If Allah allows me to attend a battle against the mushrikin, Allah will certainly see what I will do!\u2019 Then, when the day of Uhud came and the Muslims became exposed, he said, \u2018O Allah, I ask Your pardon for what these ones (i.e. the Sahabah) have done, and I absolve myself before You of what these ones (i.e. the  mushrikin)  have  done.\u2019  He  then  advanced  and was met by Sa\u2019d Ibn Mu\u2019adh, so he said, \u2018O Sa\u2019d Ibn Mu\u2019adh, it is Jannah, by the Lord of an-Nadr! Indeed, I smell its fragrance before Uhud.\u2019 Sa\u2019d said, \u2018But I was not able, O Messenger of Allah, to do what he did.\u2019\u201d Anas said, \u201cWe found on him eighty some-odd sword wounds,  spear  wounds,  and  arrow  wounds,  and  we found that he had been killed and the mushrikin had mutilated him, so no one recognized him except for his sister, through his fingertips.\u201d Anas then said, \u201cWe would view or think that this ayah was revealed about him and his likes: \u2018Among the believers are men true to what they promised Allah\u2019 (Al-Ahzab 23).\u201d\n\u2018Umayr Ibn al-Hammam \uf068 Races to a Garden as \nWide as the Heavens and Earth\nAnd here we have Anas \uf068 telling us about their endeavor.

You did not think they would leave, and  they  thought  that  their  fortresses  would  protect them from Allah; but [the decree of] Allah came upon them from where they had not expected, and He cast terror into their hearts\u201d (Al-Hashr 2).\nJust one week before the blessed month of Ramadan, the world\u2019s attention was focused on the British city of Manchester. A soldier of the Khilafah had carried out a Just Terror operation, striking Manchester Arena at the conclusion of a concert by an American singer. The explosion rocked the city and filled its residents with terror as many of them scrambled to try to contact their loved ones and ensure that they were safe. Then, the casualty figures started emerging: More than 20 had been killed and dozens more had been wounded. The total would later climb to nearly 100 dead and wounded.\nIn  the  wake  of  the  bombing,  the  panic-ridden friends and relatives took to social media to enlist the help of strangers in the search for their loved ones, local pubs began offering free booze to emergency personnel in need of clearing their minds of the traumatic scenes they had witnessed, British \u201cMuslims\u201d came out and offered their token denunciations out of fear of retaliation, massive numbers of police and military personnel were deployed on the streets, the UK threat level was raised to \u201cCritical,\u201d Politicians brought their campaigning  for  the  upcoming  general  elections  to  a  halt,  the distraught  and  \u201cbroken\u201d  American  singer  placed  her European tour on hold and went home, and the Chelsea FC football team cancelled their victory parade in London. The enemies of Islam did their best to put on a brave and defiant face, but their efforts were a complete failure. They were clearly suffering.\nOn the surface, the operation in Manchester seemed to confirm what so many analysts had been asserting for  some  time  now:  that  with  the  loss  of  territory  in Iraq and Sham, the Islamic State would shift its focus towards carrying out attacks on Crusader soil. What many of these analysts failed to admit, however, is that losing territory was nothing new for the Islamic State. The loss of most of its territory in the wake of the Sahwah initiative in Iraq did not lead to its defeat. Rather, it only led to the Islamic State regrouping, redoubling its efforts, rekindling the flames of war, recapturing every inch of territory it had lost, and expanding into Sham, Sinai, Khurasan, and multiple other regions around the world, regions where no one would have expected that the mujahidin would take control and establish the rule \nof Allah.\nSo  it  came  as  no  surprise  when,  several  thousand miles from Manchester, the soldiers of the Khilafah in East Asia stormed the city of Marawi in the southern Philippines on the island of Mindanao, chased out the local police and the military, and raised the banner of the Islamic State in a scene reminiscent of the liberation of Mosul from the Rafidi murtaddin and their Crusader allies. The victory came several weeks after Rodrigo Duterte, the Crusader taghut of the Philippines, admitted that the situation in the southern part of the Philippines was giving him a headache and making him lose sleep.\nThis taghut came into power believing that he had the  ability  to  negotiate  with  the  \u201cIslamist  militants\u201d in the southern region of the Philippines, particularly those in his own homeland of Mindanao, in the hopes of  bringing  an  end  to  their  jihad  and  subsequently expelling  the  American  forces  present  in  the  Philippines. But when the soldiers of the Khilafah repeatedly demonstrated to him that they only negotiate with their enemies using bullets and bombs, he was reduced to begging the mayors governing the Muslim areas in the southern part of the country to help him deal with the mujahidin, while simultaneously threatening to impose martial law in their areas if the problem wasn\u2019t tackled. Then, when the soldiers of the Khilafah stormed the city of Marawi, he held to his promise and imposed martial law, sending in his military to try to regain control of the city, with the mujahidin subsequently massacring dozens of his Crusader soldiers and kindling a new front in their war against kufr.\nThe reality faced by the Crusaders today is that despite their claims that the Islamic State has been weakened,  the  mujahidin\u2019s  ousting  of  the  Crusaders  and their  puppets  and  their  attainment  of  consolidation in the land can come as quickly and unexpectedly in any region of the earth, just as they did previously in Mosul, and their strikes in the heart of the Crusaders\u2019 strongholds in the West will continue to occur just as suddenly and unexpectedly as occurred in Manchester. For just as Allah c expelled the disbelieving Crusaders at their first gathering and mobilization in Iraq, it is He who will expel them from the lands of the Muslims in the Philippines and cast terror into their hearts in their own strongholds in the West.\n\u201cAnd Allah prevails over His affair, but most of the \npeople do not know\u201d (Yusuf 21).\nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Front Cover", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "0"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5-Leaders-of-the-Murabit-Emirate", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "5", "schema:articleBody": "The Reviver of the Shari\u2019ah in the Lands of the Sahara\n\u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin\nFrom the established ways of Allah \uf062 concerning His creation is that whenever people stray from the right path, He sends someone to them who will revive the matter of their religion. Some of the people will obey him, but most of them will oppose him. The muwahhidin will show their rejection of whoever opposes the methodology of Allah \uf062 and they will fight them with the sword until Allah makes His religion manifest, so that religion \u2013 in its entirety \u2013 shall be His. From amongst these revivers was the caller, the scholar, the mujahid \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin \uf072.\nHis story began when Yahya Ibn Ibrahim, the shaykh of the Kadalah tribe, which resided in the Maghrib desert, took him to teach his people about the Shari\u2019ah of Allah and His hudud. He was a good man who loved the religion, and he had been in search of someone who would go with him to call his people, but many of the du\u2019at refused to go with him to the desert due to the hardship it entailed, except for the teacher and mujahid \u2013 \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin \u2013 who accepted the mission and sought Allah\u2019s aid to complete it.\nAs-Salawi said, \u201cOne of their men undertook the assignment. He was called \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin al-Juzuli. Participating in several sciences, he was a clever student and possessed merit, religiosity, piety, and good politics\u201d (Al-Istiqsa). And so, Ibn Yasin endured remoteness and traveled into the \nheart of the Sahara, carrying the religion to a people who had strayed from it.\nWhen  \u2018Abdullah  Ibn  Yasin  arrived  at  the  camping grounds of the Lamtunah tribe, and they asked him what he had brought to them, he told them about the Shari\u2019ah of Islam, which he had come to teach to them and whose hudud he had come to apply. Ibnul-Athir said, \u201cThey said, \u2018Recall for us the Shari\u2019ah of Islam.\u2019 So he taught them the creed and obligations of Islam. They said, \u2018As for what you mentioned of prayer and zakah, then this is close [to what we accept]. As for your saying that whoever kills is to be killed, whoever steals is to [have his hand] cut off, and whoever fornicates is to be lashed or stoned to death, then this is something by which we will not abide. Go to someone else.\u2019 So both of them left\u201d (Al-Kamil fit-Tarikh). And thus, this apostate tribe initially resisted abiding by the Shari\u2019ah and Ibn Yasin refused to remain with them as long as they did not accept the Shari\u2019ah in its entirety.\nIbn Yasin pressed on to the tribe of Kadalah in the company of its shaykh. Ibnul-Athir said, \u201cSo \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin called them and those tribes neighboring them to the rule of Shari\u2019ah. Some of them obeyed, while others abstained and disobeyed.\u201d When the tribe lost patience with abiding by the Shari\u2019ah, refusing to submit to it, they compelled him to leave them. Since Ibn Yasin had no power, at that time, to wage war against them, he resolved to go to the Sudan for the \nArticle\fto eradicate \u201cLa ilaha illallah\u201d from the earth. But it is impossible for him to do so, as the Ummah of Muhammad \uf067 is a fertile ummah \u2013 not a barren one \u2013 and it will remain so until Allah inherits the earth and all that is upon it.\nHowever, some women might not comprehend the enemy\u2019s policy in their war against the muwahhidin, nor do they appreciate that with the birth of every newborn Muslim, a thorn is planted into the throat of kufr and a dagger is stabbed into the flank of shirk. Nor do these women realize that by increasing the number of Muslims, the despicable are suffocated and the banners of the kuffar are lowered, just as the voices of the righteous are raised.\nAs for the policy of birth control, it is a disease that was injected into our fertile ummah by the enemy in order to decrease the Muslim population and weaken its strength. The Prophet \uf067 ordered to increase the Muslims\u2019 numbers, as Ma\u2019qil Ibn Yasar said, \u201cA man came to the Prophet \uf067 and said, \u2018I have found a woman who is both noble in lineage and beautiful, but she is barren. Should I marry her?\u2019 He said, \u2018No.\u2019 A second man came to him [with the same question], so he forbade him. Then a third man came to him, so he said, \u2018Marry the affectionate woman who is fertile, for I will outnumber the [other] nations through you\u2019\u201d (Reported by Abu Dawud and Ibn Hibban).\nLikewise, the Prophet \uf067 supplicated for Anas Ibn Malik \uf068 to have many children and to be blessed with them, saying, \u201cO Allah, increase his wealth and children, and bless him through what You have given him\u201d (Reported by alBukhari and Muslim). Anas later said, \u201cMy daughter told me that more than 120 of my progeny were buried, and I am the wealthiest of the Ansar\u201d (Reported by Ahmad).\nAl-Ahnaf Ibn Qays entered upon Mu\u2019awiyah \uf068, who was looking at his son Yazid in front of him admiringly and then said, \u201cO Abu Bahr, what do you say about children?\u201d He replied, \u201cThey are the support for our backs, the fruit of our hearts, and the coolness of our eyes. We attack our enemies with them and they are what is left of us after we die. Thus, be to them as if you are a humble earth and shading sky. If they ask of you, then give to them. If they require admonition, then admonish them. Do not refrain from being generous to them, lest they become bored of your company, dislike your life, and long for your death.\u201d Mu\u2019awiyah said, \u201cMay Allah bless you, O Abu Bahr. They are just as you have described\u201d (Amali al-Qali).\nLikewise, we will not miss this opportunity to warn every Muslim sister of another evil policy of Islam\u2019s enemies, which is to delay marriage until a later age. This is part of the kafir plot to turn Muslimat away from their true role in life, that they were created for the tawhid of Allah \uf062 and worshiping only Him and no one else and then for serving the religion by what Allah made easy for them, including marriage, bearing children, and raising them.\nIf  only  the  Muslimah  knew  the  benefits  of  marrying early, along with the intention to increase the population and produce righteous children who will be dutiful to her and supplicate for her and their father even after both of them die! Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cWhen a person dies, his deeds shall cease except for three: a continuous charity, beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who supplicates for him\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah).\nHe \uf067 also said, \u201cIndeed, Allah \uf062 will raise the righteous slave\u2019s rank in Jannah, so he will say, \u2018My Lord, what have I done to receive this?\u2019 He will say, \u2018It is due to your child asking forgiveness for you\u2019\u201d (Reported by Ahmad and Ibn Majah from Abu Hurayrah).\nIn his sahih, al-Bukhari titled a chapter as \u201cChapter: He Who Produces Children for Jihad,\u201d and then reported from Abu Hurayrah \uf068 that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cSulayman Ibn Dawud \uf071 said, \u2018Tonight, I will visit one-hundred women \u2013 or ninety-nine \u2013 and each of them will produce a knight who will wage jihad for Allah\u2019s cause.\u2019 His companion said to him, \u2018Inshaallah.\u2019 But he did not say, \u2018Inshaallah.\u2019 So none of them became pregnant except one woman, who gave birth to half a child. By Him in whose hand is my soul, if he had said, \u2018Inshaallah,\u2019 they would have all been knights waging jihad for Allah\u2019s cause.\u201d\nIf the Muslimah knew how much support for the religion and aggravation for the kuffar is found therein, she would change her former attitude forever, in order to be from those who \u201cdo not take a step that aggravates the kuffar or do anything that harms an enemy, except that a righteous deed is written for them\u201d (At-Tawbah 120).\nThe Muslimah should reflect over the saying of \u2018Umar \uf068, \u201cBy Allah, I force myself to have intercourse, hoping that Allah will bring forth from my loins someone who will praise Allah\u201d (Reported by al-Bayhaqi in al-Kubra).\nAlso, marrying off one\u2019s daughters at what is known as a \u201cyoung age\u201d is considered a punishable crime according to the taghut laws of some so-called \u201cIslamic\u201d countries. As for the Shari\u2019ah of Islam, then nothing is halal except what Allah \uf063 has permitted, and nothing is haram except what Allah has forbidden. Indeed, \u2018Aishah \uf069 said, \u201cThe Prophet \uf067 married me when I was 6 years old. Then, we came to Madinah and stayed with Bani al-Harith Ibn Khazraj. I became ill and my hair started to fall out. When it grew to about shoulder length, my mother Umm Ruman came to me while I was playing with some of my friends on a swing. She called out to me, so I came to her, not knowing what she wanted with me. She then took my hand until she stopped me at the door of the house. I was breathing heavily until my breathing settled a bit. She then took some water and wiped my face and head with it. Then, she brought me into the house, where women from the Ansar were gathered, and they said, \u2018For wellness and blessing and good!\u2019 So she gave me to them and they fixed me up. I was not startled by any of this until Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 came at midmorning. She then gave me to him, and I was \u2013 on that day \u2013 9 years old\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).Once the Muslim sister knows this, she will cast anything contrary to it aside, devote herself to increasing the Ummah  in  lions  and  preparing  them,  making  a  den  for them out of her house, wherein she nourishes them with tawhid and wala and bara, until she opens the den\u2019s door for them, after their hearts have become \u201csevere against the disbelievers and merciful to one another\u201d (Al-Fath 29), and \u201chumble to the believers, mighty against the disbelievers, waging jihad for Allah\u2019s cause and not fearing the blame of any blamer\u201d (Al-Maidah 54). And our final call is that all praise belongs to Allah, Lord of the creation.\n\f", "schema:headline": "Leaders of the Murabit Emirate", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "29"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah11-Contents", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "S\nT\nISSUE 11 - SHAWWAL 1438\nO MUWAHHIDIN, REJOICE, FOR BY ALLAH, WE WILL NOT REST FROM OUR JIHAD EXCEPT BENEATH THE OLIVE TREES OF RUMIYAH (ROME).

They neither accepted disgrace in their religion, nor did they surrender to their enemy, and they did not retreat from a piece of land except that they filled it with the torn limbs of the mushrikin and their blood, in order that they may not rejoice over their advances, nor celebrate an easy victory. And thus is the way of the  people  of  tawhid  everywhere,  and  the  stories  of their steadfastness and heroism in fighting are nothing strange. Here are the epic battles of Sirte, Fallujah, Bab, and other than them from among their timeless battles,  bearing  witness  to  the  truthfulness  of  their words, and the goodness of their deeds. \u201cAnd whoever is an ally of Allah and His Messenger and those who have believed - indeed, the party of Allah - they will be the predominant\u201d (Al-Maidah 56).\nAnd today is the day for the people of tawhid and the soldiers of the Khilafah in the city of Raqqah to compete with their brothers in pursuing the pleasure of the Lord of the creation, and in pursuit of the highest degrees of Jannah, whereby they cling tightly to their posts with their molars, and sacrifice their lives for the cause of their religion, remaining true to what they promised Allah, each one of them declaring in his position: Allah \uf063 shall see what I do today. And so they confront their enemies on the frontlines, not turning their faces away during the confrontation, until they meet their Lord, for He \uf063 has laughed and is pleased with them.\nFor the murtaddin have come to them with fear and apprehension, as they know for certain that this battle is not like any other battle that has preceded it and  in  which  they  engaged  with  the  soldiers  of  the Khilafah, and because of this they prepared for it that which they had not prepared for previous instances, and  they  mustered  for  it  soldiers  the  likes  of  which they had never done before, and the Crusaders presented them with support the likes of which they had never  done  before,  and  the  Crusader  leadership  still continue to remind them that this battle will not be easy, and that it won\u2019t be ended any time soon, preparing them mentally to continue forward regardless of whatever losses are incurred and however long it takes.However, the Crusaders and their murtadd allies know with certainty that there is not an army in the \nworld that is able to continue in a battle whose losses are greater than its ability to compensate, and whose duration is longer than its strength to hold out and persist,  and  if  that  weren\u2019t  the  case,  the  Crusader American  army  wouldn\u2019t  have  felt  compelled  to  retreat, leaving Iraq defeated and expelled after what it encountered at the hands of the mujahidin, and due to what its leaders recognized of the huge magnitude of exhaustion that had afflicted it, and which began to threaten their entire country, through its economy which was struck by the crisis, and its prestige which had reached rock bottom, and its strategy which was forced to be changed due to its high costs.\nFrom the greatest causes of fear that the Crusaders and their murtadd allies have is that they know very well the size of their forces, and they realize that the PKK and their small numbers, and the burdensome expenses on the Crusader treasury involved in arming them, and their murtadd soldiers whom they apprehend  from  the  streets  and  after  some  poor  training hurl them into the battle fronts, are not capable \u2013 by Allah\u2019s permission \u2013 of enduring a severe battle similar to Mosul, nor are they capable of enduring a minute portion of the burdensome expenses which the Rafidah have endured throughout that battle, nor do they possess the great inherent strength required to assist them in replenishing those lost, or reinforcing those present, for we have seen how they were in the battle of Manbij and how they complained of collapse after only two months of battle, except that Allah accomplished a matter already destined.\nWhat is obligatory upon every mujahid in the city of Raqqah, wherever he is stationed, is to place in his calculations that this battle be a front for annihilating the murtaddin, a recompense for their disbelief in Allah the AlMighty, and their waging war against His religion,  and  a  final  payment  of  a  lengthy  bill  with them, for there is no end to this battle except that one of us will annihilate the other. Either we will exterminate them by Allah\u2019s might and strength \u2013 such that they lose in this world and in the Hereafter \u2013 or die trying, so that we would meet Allah having remained steadfast upon His religion, fighting his enemies, and succeed  as  the  companions  of  the  ditch  succeeded, and profit in the abode of the Hereafter \u2013 the abode of eternity \u2013 with no third option between us and them.

For today, it is the only battle on the primary outpost of Islam, and steadfastness therein and holding ribat on its lines means to safeguard the primary outpost, from which we can strike at kufr and aggression.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that we consider the enemy\u2019s entering and moving deep into the city, or that they become fortified on its outskirts, that they have achieved their goals and victory. No, for our battle with this enemy is a war of streets and cities, differing in its tactics and  methods,  defensively  and  offensively.  And  fierce wars are not decided over a period of days or weeks, but it takes a long time for the true announcement of success for either side.\nIt is enough for us that, before the results are decided, our eyes are cooled by seeing the sons of Islam standing firm like tall mountains on the blessed lines of Fallujah, teaching the Ummah new lessons of hardness, patience, and certainty.\n6ARTICLE\nPerhaps we could cast a look at some of these lessons \nand the great results produced by this lofty battle.\nFirst, this battle gave new life to the meanings of might, honor, and resistance, as the Ummah became certain that there is a group of its sons who are able to confront the grave dangers with boldness, steadfastness, and resolve; and that this group was truthful with its ummah in its plans and projects, through which the Ummah  was  revived  and  due  to  which  its  sons\u2019  and leaders\u2019 blood was often shed.\nSecond, the Ummah, during its time of humiliation and being fractured, learned that it is able to confront, perform ribat, and battle the heads of the earth and its oppressors with only a few of its sons and a light supply of weapons. It is thus able, thereby, to afflict the enemy with great and painful losses and to force them to sip from the bitter cup of defeat.\nThird, Fallujah opened the battleground for its contenders, igniting the directed efforts of the sons of Islam inside and outside of Iraq, and by shedding its pure blood which was spilled on its ground through many sons of Islam, in order for them to cover the costs of ji-\nARTICLE\fever  is  content,  then  this  is  the  Shari\u2019ah  of  Allah. Whoever dislikes it, is discontent with it, and refuses it, then we will continue in spite of him. This is the religion of Allah. We will declare the apostates as disbelievers and disavow them all. We will take the disbelievers and polytheists as enemies and hate them.\u201d\nThe Opinion of the Islamic State Is That of Its Imam, Those Whom He Delegated, and Its Offi-\ncial Spokesman\nIn refutation of those who spread their own misguided  opinions  and  beliefs,  marketing  them  to people  as  being  held  by  the  Islamic  State,  of  both the  people  of  ghulu  and  those  of  irja,  specifically  regarding  the  issues  of  takfir,  as  well  as  those who defame the \u2018aqidah and manhaj of the Islamic State, even making takfir of its soldiers and leaders, based  on  false  opinions  and  beliefs  that  they  have ascribed to it or due to their ignorance of the creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama\u2019ah, which they criticize whenever  it  opposes  their  desires,  the  Delegated Committee said in its blessed statement, \u201cAs for the statements that distort the creed of wala and bara, burying the millah of Ibrahim \uf06e in the shubuhat of people of irja (Murjii doctrine) and tajahhum (Jahmi doctrine). Likewise are the opinions of the people of ghulu (those extreme in matters of takfir), those who passed through the religion as the arrow passes through its target; the State is innocent of them. And  no  one  has  the  right  to  speak  in  its  name  or ascribe an opinion to it that it did not hold, for its saying is the saying of its Imam (may Allah honor him through tawhid), and those whom he delegates, or of its official spokesman. As for the fabricating of lies  and  speaking  based  on  assumption,  then  that is to speak without knowledge, which Allah c has forbidden.\u201d\nThe Islamic State Does Not Refrain from Making Takfir of the Mushrikin, and Makes Making Takfir of the Mushrikin One of the Utmost Principles of the Religion Brought by the Mes-\nsengers\nThe  Delegated  Committee  referred  to  various kinds of people of misguidance from those who fabricate  lies  against  the  Islamic  State,  those  who  as-\ncribe opinions to it that are not held by its leaders and beliefs that they have rejected.\nOf these are those who hold the opinions of irja, ascribing their own errors and deviances to the Islamic State, like how they \u201caccept the Islam of one who  does  not  make  takfir  of  his  people\u2019s  taghut,\u201d while \u201c[the Islamic State\u2019s official opinion] is that of making takfir of the tawaghit and whoever defends them and does not make takfir of them, without exception.\u201d  Similarly,  there  are  those  who  \u201ctreat  the making of takfir of mushrikin a matter that is khafiyyah  (obscure)  or  khilafiyyah  (disputable),  placing difficult restraints on its implementation, such that the  third  nullifier  of  Islam  is  completely  and  categorically  suspended  [\u2026]  Worse  than  this  is  that they claim that this opinion is that of the Islamic State! This is a pure fabrication. Those both far and near know that the Islamic State (may Allah honor it through tawhid) has not ceased for a single day from making  takfir  of  the  mushrikin,  and  that  it  treats the making of takfir of the mushrikin as one of the utmost  principles  of  the  religion,  which  must  be known before knowing the prayer and other obligations that are known of the religion by necessity. As such, in its statement that came from the Central Office Overseeing Shar\u2019i Dawawin, regarding the one who refrains from making takfir of the mushrikin, on  22/8/1437.\u201d\nWhat the memo meant when referring to \u201cprinciples of the religion\u201d (usul ad-din) are those matters of \u2018aqidah that the Prophets \uf070 taught their people, i.e. those matters directly established by their messages,  which  is  in  opposition  to  what  is  meant  by \u201cprinciple of the religion\u201d (asl ad-din), which is what was established before the messages came and before the messengers were sent \uf070, like the tawhid of Allah\u2019s rububiyyah (divinity) and uluhiyyah (worship).Also attributed to this kind of misguidance are those who \u201callow the shirk of tahakum (litigation) to the taghut with the claim of necessity, putting it in the status of ikrah (coercion),\u201d those who \u201creject the  ijma\u2019  of  the  Sahabah  on  making  takfir  of  the mumtani\u2019 factions (those who forcefully refuse the implementation of the Shari\u2019ah),\u201d those who \u201crefrain from making takfir of those who vote with the claim of their being ignorant of the reality of elections,\u201d and those who \u201cdo not make bara (disavowal) of the scholars  of  taghut  who  are  calling  to  committing shirk.\u201d\nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "And Likewise the Messengers Are Afflicted: Part 3", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "5"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq13", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah10-Among-the-Believers-Are-Men", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "28SHUHADA\nSHUHADA\fentered the building and carried out a massacre on the murtaddin inside for three consecutive hours, leading to approximately 30 Afghan policemen and journalists being killed and a number of others being wounded.\nEast Asia\n  On the 3rd of Sha\u2019ban, the soldiers of the Khilafah killed 5 soldiers of the Crusader Filipino army and wounded 6 others after detonating an explosive device in the city of Manila in the Philippines.\n  On the 10th of Sha\u2019ban, the soldiers of the Khilafah killed 5 Shi\u2019ah and wounded 6 others after detonating an explosive device on them in the middle of the city of Manila. \n  On the 14th of Sha\u2019ban, the soldiers of the Khilafah detonated an explosive device on a group of soldiers belonging to the Crusader Filipino army in the city of Cotabato in the southern Philippines, killing one of them and injuring three others.\n  On the 27th of Sha\u2019ban, the soldiers of the Khilafah launched a wide scale attack on positions of the Filipino Crusader forces in the city of Marawi located on  the  island  of  Mindanao  towards  the  south  of  the Philippines.

As such, it is a foundational principle in the Shari\u2019ah of the last prophet \uf067, as it was clearly shown in his sirah and that of the Sahabah, who loudly proclaimed enmity towards the people of shirk in Makkah, then fought them with the sword and battled them after making hijrah to Madinah, to the point that one would kill his mushrik father or brother before other mushrikin, as long as they fought Allah and His Messenger.\nThe Prophet \uf067 Begins His Da\u2019wah by Disavowing \nthe Tawaghit\nEver since the Prophet \uf067 made his da\u2019wah public, he pronounced a clear enmity towards the mushrikin, faulted  their  alleged  gods,  and  warned  them  that  if they persisted in their kufr, they would be from the people of the Fire. Ibn Ishaq said, \u201cWhen the Messenger of Allah \uf067 first called his people to Islam and was public with that, as Allah ordered him to be, his people were not far from him. And they did not respond to him, according to what has reached me, until he mentioned  their  \u2018gods\u2019  and  faulted  them.  When  he did so, they regarded his act as an enormity and they rejected him. They unanimously agreed to oppose him and show hostility towards him, except those whom Allah protected with Islam, though they were few and hidden\u201d (Sirat Ibn Hisham). The Muslims then were also weak and lacked the means. However, publicly calling to tawhid required that they declare their disavowal of the tawaghit and that they show enmity to their worshipers.\nWhen Quraysh came to the Prophet \uf067 asking him to make exceptions in worship, such that he would worship their tawaghit sometimes and, in return, they would worship his god (Allah) for a time, ayat were revealed prohibiting that, showing there could be no convergence between tawhid and shirk. Ibn Hisham said,  \u201cAl-Aswad  Ibn  al-Muttalib  Ibn  Asad  Ibn  \u2018Abdil-\u2018Uzza,  al-Walid  Ibn  al-Mughirah,  Umayyah  Ibn Khalaf, and al-\u2018As Ibn Wail as-Sahmi \u2013 who were all elders among their people \u2013 confronted Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 as he was walking around the Ka\u2019bah. They said, \u2018O Muhammad, come, let us worship what you worship and you worship what we worship, so that we can share in this matter. If that which you worship turns out to be better than what we worship, we will have had our portion of it, and if what we worship turns out to be better than what you worship, you will \nhave had your portion of it.\u2019 At that, Allah revealed, \u2018Say, \u201cO disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship. Nor are you worshippers of what I worship. Nor will I be a worshipper of what you worship. Nor will you be worshippers of what I worship. For you is your religion, and for me is my religion\u2019 (Al-Kafirun).\u201d\nThe Muslims Fight Their Mushrik Relatives\nWhen Allah facilitated the hijrah of His Prophet to Madinah and an Islamic state was established therein, disavowal of the mushrikin was no longer counted to be merely declaring enmity to them and dispraising them. Rather, waging jihad against them and fighting them until they surrender to the command of Allah was added to it.\nAt Badr (2 AH), the swords of the muwahhidin met those of their mushrik cousins who warred against the religion of Allah. The Muslims did not wane in fighting and harming them. Some Sahabah saw their fathers and brothers slain before their eyes, and some of them killed their relatives with their own hands. When Allah blessed the Muslims with victory, and the Muslims detained large numbers of mushrikin, \u2018Umar al-Faruq \uf068 expressed the opinion, which would later be supported by divine decree, that those captives should be killed \u2013 and that each should be killed at the hands of his relative.\nMuslim reported that Ibn \u2018Abbas \uf06b said, \u201cWhen they took the captives, the Messenger of Allah \uf067 said to Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar, \u2018What do you think about these prisoners?\u2019 Abu Bakr said, \u2018O Prophet of Allah, they are cousins and from the tribe. I suggest that you take a ransom from them, which we could use to gain strength against the kuffar, and perhaps Allah would guide them to Islam.\u2019 The Messenger of Allah \uf067 said, \u2018What do you say, Ibnul-Khattab?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah. I do not think what Abu Bakr thinks. But I think we have gained the ability to strike their necks, so \u2018Ali should strike the neck of \u2018Aqil (his brother) and I strike the neck of so-and-so (his relative), as these are the leaders and champions of kufr.\u2019 The Messenger of Allah \uf067 favored what Abu Bakr said and did not favor what \u2018Umar said. When \u2018Umar showed up the next day, the Messenger of Allah \uf067 and Abu Bakr were sitting and weeping. \u2018Umar said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, tell me what makes you and your companion weep. If I find the weeping to be worthy, I too shall weep; otherwise, I will feign it [to do as you do].\u2019 So the Messenger of Allah \uf067 said, \n\f", "schema:headline": "La Ilaha Illallah in Word and Deed", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "21"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah8-And-Fight-the-Mushrikin-Collectively", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "ArticleArticle\n\fJourneying in Search of the People of Truth\nborders and airports. So he returned to the birthplace of his fathers in Sham, staying in the city of Aleppo for a few years, seeking knowledge, calling his family and friends to tawhid, and anticipating his next chance to wage jihad. All the while, he was keen to avoid the eyes of the intelligence agency and avoid sitting with the  evil  scholars  who  were  allied  with  the  tawaghit. Eventually, the FBI issued an international warrant for \nThe  Dunya  and  its  adornments  could  not  tempt him. Scholastic degrees and their deception could not confine him. Neither a spouse, nor wealth, nor children could entice him away from his religion. Rather, he cast all of that behind him when he understood tawhid and knew that jihad in Allah\u2019s cause is the best proof of  his  allegiance  to the  Muslims  and his  disavowal  of  the mushrikin,  amongst whom  he  was  born, raised as a child, and entered  into  manhood.He \ncompleted his  studies  in  Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts  in  Boston, graduating as an engineer and programmer, before resolving to  go  forth  in  the cause  of  Allah  with some  of  his  friends. So they left as muhajirin to Allah, not coordinating their journey with anyone. They roamed between Yemen, Pakistan, and Iraq, hoping to meet someone who would bring them to the mujahidin. But once they became weary of finding the way, and as they feared inciting the suspicions of intelligence agencies, they returned to America, asking Allah c to guide them towards their goal.\nHe didn\u2019t stay long until he decided to try and make America itself the frontlines for his jihad and the place for his martyrdom. So he planned, along with two of his companions, to carry out an operation that would target Americans in their own land. They drew up their plans for their desired operation, including the seizure of  some  weapons  from  the  Crusaders,  which  they would then use for an attack behind enemy lines that they hoped would cause the killing of a large number of mushrikin. However, Allah decreed otherwise, and He does what He wills. Their plot was discovered just days before the operation\u2019s appointed time. But Allah saved him from falling into captivity, allowing him to leave America before the FBI could gather sufficient information  to  release  an  order  for  his  arrest  at  the \nQasim ar-Rimi, one of the Jews of jihad exposed by Shaykh Abu Sulayman\nhis arrest and put a $50,000 reward on his head.\nComing to the Islamic State\nAt  the  beginning  of  the  jihad  in  Sham,  Abu  Sulayman \uf08a went out in search of the people of tawhid among the various fighting factions. He fought alongside  one  of  the  factions  until  he  was  wounded  in  a battle against the Nusayriyyah in a neighborhood of Halab. Then, when he heard that the soldiers of the Islamic State had come to Sham, working under the name \u201cJabhat an-Nusrah li-Ahl ash-Sham,\u201d he joined up  with  them  and  met  with  their  leaders,  knowing that they were soldiers of Shaykh Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi \uf085, the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq at the time.  He  requested  that  they  transfer  him  to  Iraq, but they did not give their consent. He then insisted  that  they  allow  him  to  execute  an  istishhadi  operation against the Nusayriyyah, but they postponed their  response  to  him.

He likewise clarified the mechanism through which the office works to process the  cases  that  reach  it,  eventually  settling them  by  either  removing  injustice  from those afflicted by it or verifying the absence of  injustice  in  a  case  and  informing  the complainant  thereof.\nQuestion: Why was the Central Office \nfor Investigating Grievances established?\nAnswer: All praise is due to Allah. May Allah\u2019s blessings be upon His noble messenger and those who follow his guidance until the Day of Judgment. As for what follows:\nIndeed,  Allah  \uf062  ordered  justice  and made it among His lofty attributes. He \uf063 said, \u201cIndeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality  and  bad  conduct  and  oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will  be  reminded\u201d  (An-Nahl  90).  He  \uf063 also said, \u201cAnd the word of your Lord has been  fulfilled  in  truth  and  justice.  None can alter His words, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 115). He \uf063 likewise negated injustice from Himself; He \uf063 \n10said, \u201cIndeed, Allah does not wrong the people, but it is the people who wrong themselves\u201d (Yunus 44).\nHe  \uf063  also  forbade  injustice  in  all  its  forms,  including  associating partners with Allah, which is the greatest act of injustice, as Allah \uf063 has described: \u201cAnd [mention], when Luqman said to his son while he was instructing him, \u2018O my son, do not commit shirk with Allah. Indeed, shirk is a great injustice\u2019\u201d (Luqman 13). It is also from injustice for a person to wrong himself by disobeying the command of Allah \uf062 and transgressing His limits, as He \uf063 said, \u201cAnd whoever transgresses the limits of Allah has certainly wronged himself\u201d (At-Talaq 1). It is also from injustice for a person to wrong another individual by transgressing against his rights, as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cHe [Dawud] said, \u2018He has certainly wronged you in demanding your ewe [in addition] to his ewes. And indeed, many associates oppress one another, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds \u2013 and few are they\u2019\u201d (Sad 24).\nIndeed, the establishment of the religion is not fully actualized except with the removal of all forms of injustice, and this is what the Islamic State today is working to achieve, by Allah\u2019s grace. By waging war against shirk and subjecting the people to the rule of the Lord of all creation, the greater injustice is eliminated. And by commanding virtue and forbidding vice that which becomes manifest of man\u2019s injustice towards himself through sin and vice is eliminated. And by estab-\n\fAustralia after the blessed attacks of September 11th, following which the camp of iman and kufr became more distinct. The so-called \u201cIslamic\u201d organizations in Australia were pressured to do things in order to appease the kuffar, change  their  da\u2019wah,  and  practice  \u201cIslam\u201d  in  a  manner that  was  acceptable  to  the  Australian  government.  The so-called \u201cMuslim\u201d imams cloaked their cowardice with the words \u201chikmah\u201d and \u201cmaslahah\u201d until, as Shaykh Anwar al-\u2018Awlaqi \uf08a described, they left the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad \uf067 and \u201cmaslahah\u201d became an idol that they began to worship.\nAbu Mansur, however, was not one to make concessions to the kuffar at the expense of his religion. This angered the Australian government forcing them to plot against the  muhawiddin  with  new,  retrospective  anti-terrorism laws that allowed them to prosecute and imprison Abu Mansur for being part of a terrorist organization. As Allah says, \u201cThey resented them not except because they believed in Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy\u201d (Al-Buruj 8). They also hated and targeted Abu Mansur and his likes because of their disassociation from the kuffar, which was nothing but the excellent example of Ibrahim \uf06e, who said to his people, \u201cIndeed, we are innocent of you and from whatever you worship other than Allah. We have disbelieved in you, and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone\u201d (Al-Mumtahanah 4).\nDuring his imprisonment, Abu Mansur witnessed the betrayal of the imams of kufr, which added to his feeling of  strangeness.  In  particular,  he  witnessed  the  treachery \nof the apostate Samir Mohtadi, who volunteered as a witness for the prosecution against the brothers, as well as the apostate Mohammed Omran (Abu Ayman), who called on his followers to participate in the kufri religion of democracy,  and  also  called  on  them  to  disassociate  themselves from the imprisoned brothers and their families. At the same time, these \u201cimams\u201d competed with one another to appease the kuffar by erecting \u201cmoderate\u201d Islamic centers. Rather than inciting their followers to carry swords, they  encouraged  them  to  carry  pamphlets  and  make \u201cstreet  da\u2019wah\u201d  to  bikini-clad  women.  They  carried  on with their pacifist and even pro-democracy da\u2019wah while Muslim women around the world were being abused, vilified, imprisoned, and violated at the hands of the kuffar and their puppets. This was one of the things that burned Abu Mansur the most, for he had tremendous jealousy for his sisters and his eyes would well with tears every time he heard of their suffering.\nAs  the  fitnah  of  strangeness  increased  around  Abu Mansur during his five years of imprisonment, his iman also  increased  and  he  drew  closer  to  his  Lord.  Despite missing  the  birth  of  his  eldest  son  and  his  daughters\u2019 childhoods, he remained patient, spending his time memorizing much of the Quran and reflecting upon it and the reality of sacrifice. Abu Mansur was released from prison more emboldened and more steadfast upon this path. He quickly set out to make hijrah, leaving behind his beloved wife and four children in order to bring triumph to this religion and to quench his thirst for the blood of the Nusayriyyah.\nAbu Ayman shows support for the Turkish tawaghit\n\f", "schema:headline": "Interview with the Amir of the Central Office for Investigating Grievances", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "9"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah9", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah1-Operations", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "1", "schema:articleBody": "As the soldiers of the Khilafah continue waging war on the forces of kufr, we take a glimpse at a number of recent operations conducted by the mujahidin of the Islamic State that have succeeded  in  expanding  the  territory of  the  Khilafah,  or  terrorizing,  massacring,  and  humiliating  the  enemies of Allah. These operations are merely a selection of the numerous operations that  the  Islamic  State  has  conducted on various fronts across many regions over the course of the last few weeks.\nBarakah Wilayah\nThe  soldiers  of  the  Khilafah  took control  of  vast  territory,  including  a number  of  villages  south  of  the  city of Shaddadi, where they succeeded in killing more than 124 murtaddin and wounding  dozens  of  others,  in  addition  to  taking  their  weapons  and  vehicles as ghanimah. This rapid assault, which lasted only a few hours, brought the  mujahidin  closer  to  the  city  of Shaddadi.\nThis  occurred  when  the  soldiers  of the  Islamic  State  carried  out  a  wide scale assault on locations of the murtadd PKK, close to the city of Shaddadi, which caused a breakdown in the ranks of the murtaddin after only two hours  from  the  time  clashes  erupted. The assault led to the mujahidin taking  control  of  several  villages  around the  city.\nThe Islamic State soldiers began with an assault on the 20th of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah, using  heavy  weapons  to  pound  the positions of the murtadd PKK in the village of Kashkash Jubur, wherein the murtaddin  had  fortified  themselves, which forced them to flee the village. An  assault  unit  of  the  Islamic  State then entered. After combing the area, they  secured  their  control  of  the  village.\nThe  soldiers  of  the  Khilafah  continued  their  advance  and  succeeded in  entering  the  southern  section  of the village of \u2018Azzawi, while inghimasi  groups  simultaneously  cut  off  the \nroads which connect the village to the city of Shaddadi and were being used \n\fOn that path, the Tabi\u2019in and the rest of the imams traveled, having for themselves many ventures in the fields of ribat and combat, despite jihad and ribat \u2013 in their days \u2013 being only fard kifayah (communally, not personally, obligatory).\nThese were the imams among the people of hadith and zuhd (disregard for the worldly life). Just as they participated in narrating knowledge, they also participated in ribat, guarding outposts, and archery. These are the likes of al-Awza\u2019i,  \u2018Abdullah  Ibn  al-Mubarak,  Ibnul-Qasim,  Abu  Ishaq al-Fizari,  Makhlad  Ibn  al-Husayn,  Ibrahim  Ibn  Adham, Hudhayfah al-Mar\u2019ishi, Yusuf Ibn Asbat, and many others. Indeed,  they  translated  their  knowledge  into  action  with ribat and jihad. There were even some muhaddithin who would stay in towns bordering Dar al-Harb so they could always be in ribat, like the Imam \u2018Isa Ibn Yunus. As such, the two imams Ibnul-Mubarak and Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, as well as others, would say, \u201cIf the people disagree about something, then examine what the people of the frontlines are upon, as the truth is with them, for Allah \uf063 says, \u2018And those who perform jihad for Us, We shall surely guide them to Our paths\u2019\u201d (Al-\u2018Ankabut 69).\nThroughout the ages, scholars from the people of hadith were found upholding the duty of jihad and declaring the truth, like Shaykhul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, who openly declared the truth and waged jihad, fighting against the Tatars,  and  Imam  Muhammad  Ibn  \u2018Abdil-Wahhab,  who fought  the  mushrikin  inside  the  Arabian  Peninsula  and waged jihad against them with weapons and words.\nEven in our time, there have been those by whom Allah revived both knowledge and creed, those who went public  with  the  truth  and  by  whom  the  truth  became  manifest. They were those who joined knowledge with jihad, like  Shaykh  Abu  Mus\u2019ab  az-Zarqawi,  Shaykh  Abu  Anas ash-Shami,  Shaykh  \u2018Abdullah  ar-Rashud,  Shaykh  AbulHasan  al-Filistini,  and  Shaykh  Maysarah  al-Gharib  \uf073.\nLikewise,  those  who  know  but  do  not  act  upon  their knowledge are dispraised according to the Shari\u2019ah. They are not considered \u201cthose with knowledge\u201d and are not called \u201cscholars\u201d with the meaning intended by the Shari\u2019ah. How could such persons be called \u201cscholars\u201d while they are hated by Allah and have earned His wrath?! Indeed, Allah got angry with the Jews and called them \u201cal-maghdub \u2018alayhim\u201d (those who have conjured His anger) due to their not acting upon their knowledge.\nAnd Allah \uf063 also said, \u201cGreatly hated, according to Allah, is that you say what you do not do\u201d (As-Saff 3). This verse contains evidence of Allah\u2019s great hatred for those who know but do not act.\nFurthermore, the Quran clarifies that whoever knows the truth  but  conceals  his  knowledge  is  cursed,  as  in  His \uf063 saying, \u201cVerily those who conceal what We revealed of clear evidences and guidance after We clarified such to the people in the Book, [then] these Allah curses and the cursers [also] \ncurse them\u201d (Al-Baqarah 159). It is known from all of the above that \u201cthose with knowledge\u201d are those who carry it, act upon it, and openly declare it.\nAllah  even  described  whoever  does  not  act  upon  his knowledge as being ignorant, as in His saying about the \u201cscholars\u201d of the Jews who followed sorcery, \u201cAnd they did surely know that whoever purchased it shall have nothing in the Hereafter, and how bad is that for which they sold their souls, if only they knew\u201d (Al-Baqarah 102). The evidence in this ayah is His saying, \u201cand they did surely know\u201d followed by \u201cif only they knew,\u201d as by not acting upon their knowledge, they were ignorant.\nAs such, whoever does not act upon his knowledge by openly  declaring  it  and  waging  jihad  or  by  concealing  it and dressing up the truth in falsehood, then he is not truly a scholar. Rather, he is a devil \u2013 whether vocal or mute.\nThe people of knowledge did not count the people of bida\u2019 (heretical innovations) as scholars, just as Ibn \u2018Abdil-Barr said  regarding  the  heretics  of  kalam  (polemical  speech), \u201cThe people of fiqh and athar (traditional narrations) in the major cities have altogether agreed that the people of polemics are people of heresy and deviance, and are not counted among the ranks of the fuqaha, and the scholars are only the people of athar\u201d (Jami\u2019 Bayan al-\u2018Ilm wa Fadlih), so how would it be if they were to have seen how the Ummah has been afflicted with the imams of kufr today?\nAnyone who looks at those who are ascribed to knowledge in our later times will find that the vast majority of them are not scholars and are not counted among the people of knowledge, due to their failure to fulfill the duty of action. They did not declare the truth in the faces of the tawaghit, but instead concealed the knowledge and dressed up the truth in falsehood, misguiding the slaves of Allah while they knew of the verses regarding fighting and combat. They turned away from their duty of action, thus being at odds with the Sunnah of the Prophet \uf067 and that of the Sahabah and Tabi\u2019in. They are seen as having studied the texts of wala and bara, yet wandered away from them. They learned the verses regarding the obligation of conveying and clarifying the truth, yet they concealed it and resorted to flattering Allah\u2019s enemies. Are these the ones whom Allah called \u201cthose with knowledge?!\u201d Far be it from Him! Certainly not! Rather, they are the people of misguidance who are threatened with punishment for abandoning action and concealing the truth. How then, if one knows that most of those who are famously attributed to knowledge in our time have displayed their obedience to the taghut and have entered into his allegiance, supporting him against any of the muwahiddin who rise against him? The ruling about whoever does this is well-known in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger \uf067.\nTherefore, Ibn Baz, Ibn \u2018Uthaymin, al-Fawzan, Al ashShaykh (the contemporaries), Muhammad Hassan, al-Huwayni, Husayn Ya\u2019qub, al-Qardawi, al-Buti, an-Nabulusi, al-Ghiryani, al-Maqdisi, Abu Qatadah, al-Haddushi, and \n\f", "schema:headline": "Operations", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "21"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah1-Among-the-Believers-Are-Men:-Abu-Mansur-al-Muhajir", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "1", "schema:articleBody": "\u201cAnd  whoever  Allah  guides  \u2013  for  him there is no misleader. Is not Allah Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution?\u201d (Az-Zumar 37).\nHere  on  this  straight  path  of  guidance lies  the  embodiment  of  triumph  \u2013  bloodied, dismembered, radiant. It is the shahid Abu  Mansur  al-Muhajir  (Ezzit  Raad)  \uf08a. We consider him so, and Allah is his judge. From a young age, the chivalrous muhajir refused to be subjugated by the shackles of humiliation  and  this  perishing  world.  He chose, instead, to surrender his soul in obedience of his Lord and to wield the weapons of faith and honor in defiance of the kafir masses.  He  remained  steadfast  in  the  face of  everything  he  was  afflicted  with,  never weakening, never surrendering, until Allah gave him triumph and his blood was spilled, pouring forth and fueling the lantern that illuminates  this  noble  path  so  that  those who follow may traverse upon a clear road.\nIndeed, this is the path of those who are truthful  with  their  Lord,  and  no  man  has ever marched upon it and tasted the sweetness of self-sacrifice, except that they did so \nthrough  Allah\u2019s  guidance,  and  if  we  were  to reflect on the story of Abu Mansur, and the story of the mujahir mujahid in general, we would truly be humbled by the monumental statement  of  our  Lord,  \u201cAllah  guides  whom He wills to a straight path\u201d (Al-Baqarah 213). \nAbu  Mansur  \u2013  originally  from  Lebanon \u2013  came  from  Melbourne,  Australia,  a  land cloaked  in  darkness  and  corrupted  by  kufr, fornication,  and  all  forms  of  vice.  Yet  even in the midst of this darkness \u2013 and by Allah\u2019s will \u2013 the flame of tawhid was ignited within his heart at the young age of 22 through the da\u2019wah of a brother who visited the grieving Abu Mansur shortly after the death of his eldest brother, Mansur. Thereafter, Abu Mansur made his way the way of the true believer, answering Allah\u2019s clear statement, \u201cSo do not weaken and do not grieve, and you will be superior if you are believers\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 139).\nWith  a  newly  acquired  unyielding  fervor and  zeal  for  his  religion,  Abu  Mansur  raced his brothers towards righteousness. He invited others to this noble path, but only to be confronted with the fitnah of strangeness and severe enmity, which began surfacing itself in \n14\ffor His cause \u2013 to spend what is dear and beloved to them in seeking His pleasure. For verily the goal is for Allah to be the most beloved thing to them, and for nothing else in existence to be more beloved to them than Him. So if out of His love they freely gave something they loved, He would move them on to another, better position \u2013 which is that they freely give their souls to Him, and that is the greatest extent of love\u201d (Badai\u2019 al-Fawaid).\nIt is known that women \u2013 other than those whom Allah protects, and they are very few \u2013 often engage in nonsense, showing ingratitude towards their husbands, backbiting, and other grave sins. So the Prophet \uf067 guided them to that  through  which  they  could  atone  for  some  of  what they have committed in this worldly life. Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 went out to the place of prayer on one of the days of Eid, either Adha or Fitr, and he passed by the women. So he said, \u201cO women, give charity, for verily I was shown that you make up the majority of the people of Hellfire.\u201d They said, \u201cWhy, O Messenger of Allah?\u201d He said, \u201cYou curse  so  much  and  are  ungrateful  to  your  husbands\u2026\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Abu Sa\u2019id al-Khudri).\nA good example for women is Asma Bint Abi Bakr \uf06b who, despite her poverty and need, and though she did not own any gold or jewelry, would ask the Prophet \uf067 about charity. She said, \u201cI said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, I have nothing except what az-Zubayr placed in my house [of what he gave her]. Should I give some of it [in charity]?\u2019 He said, \u2018Give and do not horde things, lest Allah keep things from you\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nIbn Hajar said, \u201cThe meaning of this hadith is the prohibition of restricting charity due to a fear of depletion, as that is the greatest reason for the absence of blessing, since Allah rewards \u2013 without measure \u2013 those who give. And whoever gives freely without counting how much he gave, then  he  will  be  given  without  measure  [by  Allah].  And whoever knows that Allah provides for him from whence he does not expect should give and not calculate\u201d (Fath al-Bari).\nAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 also said, \u201cVerily Allah \uf062 accepts charity, takes it by His right hand and raises it for one of you, as one of you raises his foal, until a morsel becomes like the size of Uhud\u201d (Reported by at-Tirmidhi from Abu Hurayrah).\nHow, then, about the charity given to help prepare the mujahidin for Allah\u2019s cause? Does anyone establish the religion and protect the lands of Islam other than the mujahidin? Does anyone defend honor and spite the kuffar other than the mujahidin?\nAl-Bukhari  reported  in  \u201cChapter:  The  Excellence  of One Who Prepares a Fighter or Takes Care of His Family,\u201d from Zayd Ibn Khalid \uf068 that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever prepares a fighter for Allah\u2019s cause has himself fought, and whoever takes care of the family of a fighter \nfor Allah\u2019s cause has himself fought.\u201d This is what Amirul-Muminin \u2018Uthman Ibn \u2018Affan \uf068 comprehended when he conducted his business with Allah, for which his reward  was  Paradise.  He  did  not  prepare  a  single  fighter, but rather an entire army for the Battle of Tabuk. It was the Army of \u2018Usrah, and what can make you comprehend what the Army of \u2018Usrah was? That was the army called \u201c\u2018Usrah\u201d  (hardship)  because  it  was  during  difficult  days and hard times for the Muslims. \u2018Abdur-Rahman Ibn Samurah  \uf068  narrated  that  \u2018Uthman  came  to  the  Prophet \uf067 with one-thousand dinars when he was preparing the Army of \u2018Usrah and dropped them in the Prophet\u2019s lap. \u2018Abdur-Rahman said, \u201cI saw the Prophet \uf067 looking at the money as he said two times, \u2018Whatever \u2018Uthman does after today will not harm him\u2019\u201d (Reported by at-Tirmidhi).\nIndeed,  Shaykhul-Islam  Ibn  Taymiyyah  mentioned  a concise yet valuable fiqh-related statement regarding the status of waging jihad with one\u2019s wealth, putting it ahead of other forms of charity. He \uf072 said, \u201cIf the wealth was insufficient to both feed those who would die of hunger and to fund the jihad which would be harmed without it, we put waging jihad ahead, even if the hungry starved to death. This is like the issue of targeting human shields, but even more appropriate, as in that case we would be killing them by our own direct actions, while in this case they would die due to Allah\u2019s action alone\u201d (Al-Fatawa alKubra).\nWhen  we  reflect  over  the  condition  of  some  of  the women today, we notice them spending extravagantly on transient  worldly  things  of  clothing,  jewelry,  feasts,  and so  forth.  All  the  while,  we  see  them  being  miserly  and stingy when it comes to the religion of Allah \uf063 \u2013 though He is Rich and we are needy. \u201cHere you are, those who are called to spend for Allah\u2019s cause, yet some of you are stingy. And whoever is stingy is only stingy against himself. And Allah is Rich and you are needy. And if you turn away, He will substitute [you] with another people, and they  will  not  be  like  you\u201d  (Muhammad  38).  So  is  the Muslim woman\u2019s hand open to spend on the worldly life but closed to spend on what benefits her in the Hereafter? Will not someone follow the example of Sawdah \uf069, the Prophet\u2019s wife and the Mother of the Believers? \u2018Aishah \uf069 narrated that some of the Prophet\u2019s wives \uf06c said to the Prophet \uf067, \u201cWhich of us will be quickest to join you?\u201d He said, \u201cThe one with the longest arm.\u201d So they took a reed and measured (each other\u2019s arms), and Sawdah had the longest arm. \u2018Aishah said, \u201cWe learned later that she had the longest arm [in that she would extend it most] in sadaqah. Sawdah was the quickest to join him. She loved giving charity\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nThe Muslim woman must not think that Allah \uf063 only accepts what is much and abundant. Rather, a single dirham could very likely outdo more than a thousand, and half  a  date  given  by  its  owner  as  charity  in  this  world could very likely save him from the fire of the Hereafter.

Through it, afflictions are relieved and destruction is prevented, through it the believer defends against tribulations and the plots of the enemy, through it blessings are obtained and  Allah\u2019s  wrath  is  avoided,  and  through  it  anxieties are relieved and sadness is dispelled. Du\u2019a is one of the unique aspects of worship. Rather, du\u2019a is the essence of worship, for it entails complete love and complete humility  towards  Allah,  the  One,  the  Judge,  the  Just.  In it, the slave confides with his Lord, acknowledging his inability and weakness. It is a consolation for the hearts, a healing for the chests, an ointment for the wounds, and a means of facilitating matters. Du\u2019a is a strong refuge and an impenetrable fortress. Nothing is more honored by Allah than du\u2019a. And the most incompetent of people is he who is incapable of du\u2019a, for it is an easy form of worship, which can be performed day and night, is practiced both on land and at sea, and is legislated both for when settled or traveling. Those who make du\u2019a flee unto the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the All-Knowing, and cling to their Lord, the King, the Pure, the Perfect. You see them, when making du\u2019a, casting themselves before  the  Most  Generous,  their  prayer  cutting  them  off from the world as they turn towards the Lord of all creation,  liberating  themselves  from  the  bondage  of  having  need  of  the  people  and  their  favors,  being  sincere towards their Lord in their appeal, and eagerly seeking that He bestow His bounties upon them.\nThis  is  du\u2019a.  What  is  more  greatly  needed  by  the Muslim these days when the nations of kufr and its sects and  religions  have  summoned  one  another  against  the Jama\u2019ah of the Muslims? Thus, let the mujahid pay attention to the importance of this weapon and the obligation of mastering it and leaving off clinging to anyone other than the All-Hearing, the Responding. Likewise, let every  Muslim  \u2013  male  and  female  \u2013  take  part  in  striving against  the  enemies  of  Allah  with  this  divine  and  efficient weapon. The Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cWage jihad against the  mushrikin  with  your  wealth,  your  lives,  and  your tongues\u201d (Reported by Abu Dawud and an-Nasai). The jihad of the tongue is not limited to incitement to jihad, praising  the  mujahidin,  vilifying  the  act  of  neglecting jihad, and ridiculing the disbelievers. Rather, from the most important forms of jihad by the tongue is du\u2019a, by \n32Article\nArticle\fSome historians mention that one of the kings of India made an offer to the Sultan in exchange that he stop destroying their idols and temples, saying, \u201cI know that this is something by which you get closer to your Lord, but have you  not  brought  yourselves  close  enough  by  destroying these idols and temples, especially at the fort of Nakarkart?\u201d He then promised to pay large sums of money to this end, but the Sultan refused and proclaimed that he was fighting to make Allah\u2019s word supreme and to obtain His contentment \u2013 not for the sake of this temporal world. He then hurried to the temple to destroy their idols, except for one idol, which he took with him so that it could be trampled underfoot in his own land.\nDespite  these  riches,  the  Sultan  was  not  driven  by worldly gain upon exerting this great effort in raids and destruction. Rather, he wanted to put an end to the worship \nIn the year 407AH, the conquests of Sultan Mahmud took him to one of the most heavily fortified temples. Ibnul-Athir said, \u201cThey kept many idols in it, including five made of pure gold and studded with gemstones. The gold therein totaled 690,300 dinars. There were also around two hundred idols carved from stone. Yamin ad-Dawlah took all of the treasures and destroyed everything else. He then marched on Kannauj\u2026 He took its forts and seven surrounding towns located along the river. In the area, there were nearly 10,000 idol houses, which they falsely claimed to have been 200,000 to 300,000 years old. When he conquered them, his military pillaged them all.\u201d\nBut  the  most  significant  victory  of  the  Sultan  \u2013  regarding his destruction of idols \u2013 and that which had the greatest effect, was when he destroyed the major, pagan, Indian idol called Somnath in the year 416AH. Ibnul-Athir described it, saying, \u201cThis idol was the largest idol of the Indians, who would make pilgrimage to it every night of an eclipse. About 100,000 people would gather\u2026 and they would  carry  anything  of  value  to  it,  giving  its  caretakers large sums of money. The idol had endowments amounting to 10,000 villages.\u201d\nof idols by destroying what the Indians considered to be the \u201cleader\u201d of idols. Ibnul-Athir said, \u201cEvery time Yamin ad-Dawlah was victorious in India, the Indians would say, \u2018Somnath was displeased with those idols. If he was pleased with them, he would have destroyed whoever sought them harm.\u2019 When this reached Yamin ad-Dawlah, he was determined to attack and destroy this Somnath, thinking that if the Indians were bereft of it and saw the falsehood of their claim, they would enter into Islam. So he prayed istikharah and marched from Ghaznah on the 10th of Sha\u2019ban in 416AH with 30,000 of his regular cavalry, not to mention those who volunteered.\u201d\nThe road to reaching this idol was hard and strenuous, as it required the crossing of desert terrain. But such risks did not deter the muwahhid Sultan\u2019s determination to destroy this  idol.  Ibnul-Athir  said,  \u201cWhen  he  crossed  the  desert, at its edge he saw fortresses fully stationed with fighters, as well as many wells, which the Indians had filled with sand in order to prevent him from besieging their fortresses. Allah then facilitated their conquest, upon him getting close, by casting terror into their hearts, so they surrendered. He killed the residents, destroyed their idols, and took what was needed of water and provisions.\u201d Thus, the Sultan reached Somnath after traversing deserts, battling peoples, and laying siege to forts. Ibnul-Athir said, \u201cHe reached Somnath on the day of Khamis in the middle of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah and saw a heavily fortified fortress built on the oceanfront. The sea waves would reach part of the fortress. Its people were sitting on the walls, gazing at the Muslims and entrusting their idol to foil the plan of the Muslims and make them perish.\u201d  Such  is  the  foolish  mentality  of  idol  worshipers. How then could they ever face the soldiers of tawhid, those who wage jihad for Allah\u2019s cause in order to purge the earth from the filth of shirk and its people?\nIbnul-Athir  relates  to  us  the  details  of  the  battle  and the shock of the pagans at the inactivity of their idol, as it remained motionless in front of those who came to destroy it. They put all their hopes in it, claiming that none \nRuins of the Somnath temple\n\f", "schema:headline": "Jihad through Du'a\r", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "31"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah2-A-Message-from-East-Africa", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "2", "schema:articleBody": "When  mentioning  the  obligation  of  jihad  for  His cause,  Allah  \uf063  indicated  that  some  people  would  have reservations  towards  this  noble  commandment.  He  \uf063 said, \u201cFighting has been enjoined upon you while it contains that which you dislike\u201d (Al-Baqarah 216). He then reminded  the  believers  to  place  their  trust  in  Him,  by deferring to His infinite wisdom instead of relying upon their limited knowledge. \u201cBut perhaps you dislike a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah knows, while you know not\u201d (Al-Baqarah 216). He further taught them that if it were not for jihad, the world would be filled with corruption. \u201cAnd  if  it  were  not  for  Allah  curbing  people  by  means of others, the earth would become corrupt, but Allah has much bounty for the creation\u201d (Al-Baqarah 251).\nYet despite the command to wage jihad, despite Allah\u2019s assurance of the immense good it contains for us, despite the well-being of the earth being at stake, and even despite the countless virtues and rewards promised by Allah and His Messenger for the mujahid, the murabit, and especially the shahid, there would always continue to be \u201cmen\u201d who would fail to live up to this lofty obligation. They would remain behind, making excuse after excuse, despite the clear signs placed before them, as if implying that jihad no longer exists. When this false insinuation had first reared its head during the life of the Prophet \uf067, he firmly refuted it, as Salamah Ibn Nufayl al-Kindi \uf068 narrated, \u201cI was sitting with Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 when a man said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, the people have humiliated their horses, have put down their swords, and have said, \u2018There is no jihad, for the war has laid down its burdens.\u2019\u2019 So Allah\u2019s \n2Foreword\nMessenger \uf067 turned his face towards him and said, \u2018They have lied. The fighting has just begun, and there will not cease to be a people from my Ummah fighting upon the truth\u2019\u201d (Reported by an-Nasai).\nHowever,  even  this  clear  statement  from  the  Prophet \uf067 himself would make no difference to most of the qa\u2019idin (those men who \u201csit back\u201d instead of participating in jihad) and the murjifin (scaremongers). Instead, they would remain upon their misguided way of life, choosing to lay down their swords, whether because they were too busy chasing the Dunya, too cowardly to fight for the cause of Allah, or too blinded to recognize the obligation for which they will be held accountable.\nRegardless of their excuses and misguidance, and despite the multitudes who turned their backs on the very deed described by the Prophet \uf067 as \u201cthe peak of Islam,\u201d (Reported by Ibn Majah and at-Tirmidhi from Mu\u2019adh Ibn Jabal), jihad against the enemies of Allah would continue.  Allah  would  humiliate  those  who  abandoned  it, honor those who embarked upon it, and direct His sincere slaves to keep their swords unsheathed for His sake.\n\u2018Aishah \uf069 narrated, saying, \u201cWhen Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 returned on the Day of the Trench, he put down his sword and bathed. Jibril \uf06e, with dust covering his head, came to him and said, \u2018You have laid down the sword? By Allah, I have not laid mine down.\u2019 So Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u2018Where to then?\u2019 He said, \u2018Over there,\u2019 and gestured towards  Bani  Quraydhah.\u201d  She  said,  \u201cAllah\u2019s  Messenger \uf067 then set out for them\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nThus, the Sunnah of the Prophet \uf067 was to march forth \nArticle\fThe memorandum then explains that \u201cit is wrong to use the terms asl (foundational basis) and lazim (required inference) with regards to the meaning of \u2018la ilaha illallah\u2019 and kufr bit-taghut in an argumentative manner. That is because doing so is a fruitless, invented assertion with which Allah did not burden us. Rather, multiple corrupt inferences necessarily result therefrom, like excluding certain  matters  established  by  the  advent  of  the  prophetic proof from being part of asl ad-din \u2013 in accordance with this definition \u2013 and thus excluding belief in the prophethood of Muhammad \uf067 from asl ad-din! Likewise, it leads to disputation \u2026 regarding what is included in the meaning of asl ad-din and what is excluded from it.\u201d\nThe memorandum then quotes Shaykh Sulayman Ibn \u2018Abdillah  Ibn  Muhammad  Ibn  \u2018Abdil-Wahhab  \uf073,  who was asked about a similar issue, \u201cregarding wala and bara,\u201d if such were \u201cfrom the meaning of \u2018la ilaha illallah\u2019 or from its inferred requirements?\u201d Shaykh Sulayman \uf072 responded, \u201cThe answer is to say that Allah knows best. But it is sufficient for a Muslim to know that Allah made it a duty upon him to take the mushrikin as enemies and to not take them as awliya, and He made it obligatory to love the believers and to take them as awliya. He made this an essential of iman, just as He negated the iman of whoever shows love to those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers, sons, brothers, or tribesmen. As for wala and bara being from the meaning of \u2018la ilaha illallah\u2019 or from its inferred requirements, then Allah did not burden us with researching this. He only burdened us with knowing that Allah made wala and bara a duty and obligation and that He obligated acting on the basis of wala and bara. This, undoubtedly, is what is obligatory and necessary. Thereafter, whoever knows whether wala and bara are from the meaning of \u2018la ilaha illallah\u2019 or from its inferred requirements, then knowing such is fine and an added benefit. But whoever does not know such, is not burdened to know. This is especially so if the argument or dispute over the matter leads to evil, conflict, and discord among the believers \u2013 those who upheld the obligations of iman, waged jihad for Allah\u2019s sake, took the mushrikin as enemies, and took the Muslims as awliya. Therefore, remaining silent on such matters that lead to division is definitely obligatory. This is what is apparent to me. Nevertheless, the two sides are similar in meaning. And Allah knows best\u201d (Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah).\nThe  memorandum  then  addresses  another  term,  in addition to those mentioned before, stating that \u201cit is unacceptable to use the term takfir al-\u2018adhir (takfir of the excuser) to describe the ruling of the one who refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam, because it is an inaccurate term. While we reject ignorance as an excuse for major shirk, this innovated opinion (of excusing \u2013 for ignorance  \u2013  those  claimants  of  Islam  who  commit  major shirk) does not necessitate that every excuser refrains from making takfir, as there are those of them who might consider ignorance an excuse, but who do indeed make takfir of the mushrikin because he considers the hujjah to have been established against them, so he is therefore not a refrainer. Likewise, refraining from making takfir of the mushrikin is not confined to the issue of excusing them \ndue to their ignorance, as it is possible one might refrain from making takfir of them out of his arrogance, defiance, following of desires, or citing of general texts indicating the merits of \u2018la ilaha illallah.\u2019 So the term takfir al-\u2018adhir does  not  accurately  describe  the  one  who  refrains  from making takfir of the mushrikin, such a refrainer being the one whom the scholars meant by this nullifier.\u201d\nThe memorandum continues, stating, \u201cThe one who refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam commits  an  agreed  upon  nullifier,  but  his  kufr  is  based upon establishment of the proof, unlike the one who worships others besides Allah. Making takfir of the mushrikin is  an  issue  established  by  apparent  and  numerous  texts, which all people can understand. Establishing the argument thereof is by the Quran\u2019s advent, by either it being conveyed to the people or them having the ability to reach it. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cSay, \u2018What thing is greatest in witness?\u2019 Say, \u2018Allah is a witness between me and you, and this Quran has been inspired unto me that by it I might warn you and whomever it reaches\u2019\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 19).\u201d\n\u201cThe mujaddid Shaykh Muhammad Ibn \u2018Abdil-Wahhab \uf072 said, \u2018Know that the evidences for making takfir of the otherwise righteous Muslim who commits shirk with Allah or sides with the mushrikin against the muwahaddin, even if he does not commit shirk, are more than one can compile from the speech of Allah,1 the words of His Messenger, and the statements of the scholars\u2019 (Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah). Shaykh \u2018Abdul-Latif Ibn \u2018Abdir-Rahman Ibn Hasan \uf073 said, \u2018It should be known that the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger, and the statements of  the  scholars  are  explicit,  abundant,  and  manifest  in making  takfir  of  anyone  who  supplicates  others  besides Allah and calls upon them for something only Allah can do \u2026 The entire Quran demonstrates and confirms this in various manners and expressions that explain this and make note of it\u2019 (Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah). Other scholars of the Najdi da\u2019wah said, \u2018The one who does not make takfir of the mushrikin has not accepted the teachings of the Quran to be true. The Quran has made takfir of the mushrikin and has ordered making takfir of them, taking them  as  enemies,  and  fighting  against  them\u2019  (Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah).\u201d\n\u201cHowever,  this  matter  could  become  somewhat  obscure with regards to some mushrikin who claim Islam, due to the spread of ignorance, the weakness of da\u2019wah, and the circulation of shubuhat. Here, the proof is established by demonstrating the clear texts evidencing the kufr of these mushrikin. If someone refrains after this clarification, he becomes a kafir. Shaykh Sulayman Ibn \u2018Abdillah \uf074 said, \u2018If someone doubts their kufr or is ignorant of it, the evidences proving their kufr from the Book of Allah 1   Editor\u2019s Note: Amongst these evidences are, \u201cThere has been for you an excellent example in Ibrahim and those with him, when they said to their people, \u2018Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship beside Allah. We reject your kufr. And enmity and animosity have forever emerged between us and you until you believe in Allah alone\u2019\u201d (Mumtahanah 4), as well as, \u201cSay, \u2018O kafirin, I do not worship what you worship, nor do you worship what I worship, nor do I worship in the manner you worship, nor do you worship in the manner I worship. You have your religion and I have mine!\u2019\u201d (Surat Al-Kafirun).\n\f", "schema:headline": "A Message from East Africa", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "1"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah2-Operations", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "2", "schema:articleBody": "As the soldiers of the Khilafah continue waging war on the forces of kufr, we take a glimpse at a number of recent operations conducted by the mujahidin of the Islamic State that have succeeded in expanding the territory of the Khilafah, or terrorizing, massacring, and humiliating the enemies of Allah. These operations are merely a selection of the numerous operations that the Islamic  State  has  conducted  on  various  fronts  across many regions over the course of the last few weeks.\nTarabulus Wilayah\nOn the 26th of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah, five istishhadi brothers \uf08d succeeded yesterday in detonating their explosive vehicles on positions of the murtadd Government of National Accord\u2019s militia in the city of Sirte, which resulted in the killing and wounding of hundreds, the destruction of four tanks, a BMP, and a number of armored vehicles mounted with machine guns. \nMeanwhile, a sixth istishhadi \uf08a succeeded in detonating his explosive vehicle on the murtaddin\u2019s rear positions in the area of Bu Hadi southeast of the city of Sirte.

He detonated his explosive vehicle in their midst, killing approximately 40 of them and injuring dozens more.\n On the 16th of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah, approximately 60 American-vetted Sahwah fighters were killed and wounded and two of their 4-wheel drive vehicles mounted with American  machine  guns  and  a  57mm  artillery  cannon  were destroyed when they fell into a minefield in an attempt to advance on the mujahidin\u2019s positions in the villages of Jakkah and Talghar. This was after they had gathered approximately 40 vehicles, a number of Turkish army tanks, and  more  than  300  vetted  Sahwah  infantrymen,  in  addition to Crusader air support, only to retreat in defeat and humiliation, carrying away the corpses of their dead and licking their wounds. The mujahidin also succeeded in destroying a Turkish army tank after targeting it with \nNews\fa guided missile. This was followed by an istishhadi operation carried out by our brother Abu Mus\u2019ab ash-Shami \uf08a, who detonated his explosive vehicle in the midst of approximately 20 4-wheel drive vehicles and a number of murtadd infantrymen between the villages of East Tal\u2019ar and  West Tal\u2019ar,  turning  them  into  a  heap  of  scattered limbs. The mujahidin also detonated a series of explosive devices on those who survived as they attempted to flee. The event resulted in 38 murtaddin being killed and several more being injured, along with the destruction of 10 4-wheel drive vehicles.\nDuring the course of the following days, the soldiers of the Khilafah succeeded in driving out the vetted Sahwat from 8 villages east of the town Ra\u2019i and taking control of them. They included the villages of Sandi, Shaw Kabirah, Shaw Saghirah, Rawdah, Athariyyah, Ayyubiyyah, Nahdah, and Muthminah. This occurred following a stealth advance which was punctuated by clashes with the murtaddin, who quickly fled in defeat. The mujahidin then continued their advance and captured the villages of West Tal\u2019ar,  East Tal\u2019ar,  and  Kadrish  after  conducting  stealth operations, in addition to taking control of the village of Sandarah, west of Ra\u2019i in the northern countryside after driving out the vetted Sahwat and taking 4-wheel drive vehicles and a variety of weapons and ammo as ghanimah.

They also captured a 4-wheel drive vehicle as ghanimah, as well as three 14.5mm machine guns, two 12.5mm machine guns, and a variety of weapons and ammo before returning safely back to their positions.\nDenmark\n \nOn  the  29th  of  Dhul-Qa\u2019dah,  a  soldier  of  the Khilafah  \u2013  our  brother  Mesa  Hodzik  \uf08a  \u2013  targeted  the Crusader police in Copenhagen in an operation which he carried out in response to the calls to target the nations that are members of the Crusader coalition waging war against  the  Muslims.\nSahil Wilayah\nOn the 3rd of Dhul-Hijjah, three soldiers of the Khilafah set out towards a Nusayri checkpoint at the Arzunah Bridge in Tartus where our brother Abu Ahmad ash-Shami \uf08a then detonated his explosive vehicle on the checkpoint, turning those present there into a heap of torn limbs. A security force then arrived to examine the area, and our istishhadi brothers Abu Ibrahim as-Sahili and Usamah al\u2018Iraqi \uf08d targeted them with their explosive jackets, killing and injuring dozens of murtaddin.\nThe devastating attack in Sahil shook the Nusayriyyah\n33\n\fSomalia\nOn the 15th of Dhul-Hijjah, the soldiers of the Khilafah launched an assault on a police station and checkpoint in the city Qof Judud, towards the west of Somalia.\nAmerica\nOn the 15th of Dhul-Hijjah, a soldier of the Khilafah \u2013 our brother Dahir Adan \uf08a \u2013 stabbed 10 kuffar in the state of Minnesota in response to the calls to target the citizens of the nations involved in the Crusader coalition.\nWest Africa Wilayah\nOn the 18th of Dhul-Hijjah, the soldiers of the Khilafah launched a fierce surprise attack on an African coalition convoy in the town of Malum Fatiri in Borno towards the northeast of Nigeria. The attack resulted in 40 Crusaders being killed and dozens more being injured, with those who remained alive fleeing in defeat, and the mujahidin seizing a large cache of weapons and equipment.\nDimashq Wilayah\nOn the 19th of Dhul-Hijjah, Islamic State air defense units shot down a Nusayri warplane that had carried out four  airstrikes  on  the  mujahidin\u2019s  locations  at  Mount Naqb  as  they  were  being  attacked  by  the  Sahwat.  The plane crashed between Nusayri territory and the territory of the vetted Sahwah factions, who then handed the pilot over to Nusayri forces after he had ejected and landed in the area of Sarrah near Mount al-Isharah. The handover of the pilot to the Nusayri army came after the Nusayri army agreed to requests previously made by the vetted Sahwat through  some  middlemen  from  the  \u201cnational  reconciliation\u201d for weapons and ammunition in order to replace what they\u2019d lost as a result of the Islamic State\u2019s attacks on their locations in East Qalamun in recent days. It\u2019s become widely known that the Nusayri army as of late has been launching airstrikes on a near-daily basis targeting Islamic State positions in East Qalamun and also bombarding them with heavy artillery shortly after the Khilafah\u2019s battles with the murtaddin. They have also, on several occasions, fired flares at night during the course of attacks launched  by  the  soldiers  of  the  Khilafah  on  these  locations.\nFurat Wilayah\nOn the 23rd of Dhul-Hijjah, a unit of Islamic State soldiers clashed with a joint force of Crusaders and murtaddin as they attempted to airdrop their forces using two American Chinook planes and four Apache helicopters on the road between Bayji and Hadithah near the village of Sakran. During the course of the clashes, the descending force fell into a field of mines planted by the soldiers of the Khilafah, and the clashes resulted in 10 murtaddin being killed and the joint force withdrawing in defeat.\nThe attack in Minnesota terrorized the Crusaders\nBaghdad Wilayah\nOn the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah, our istishhadi brothers Abu \u2018Aishah al-\u2018Iraqi and Abu Suhayb al-Falluji \uf08d succeeded in reaching a gathering of Rafidi mushrikin on Filastin Street in the middle of Baghdad where Abu \u2018Aishah detonated his explosive belt in their midst. He was followed by Abu Suhayb, who detonated his explosive vehicle on those of them who survived the first attack. The two blessed attacks resulted in approximately 40 murtaddin being killed and approximately 60 others being wounded.\nKenya\nOn the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah, three sisters who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State \u2013 Umm Ma\u2019bad, Umm Sa\u2019d, and Umm Maysarah \uf08e \u2013 attacked a police station in the city of Mombasa in support of the Islamic State, which is being targeted by the Crusader nations. The sisters entered the police station and attacked the personnel there with knives and a petrol bomb, injuring two Kenyan Crusader policemen before attaining shahadah when they were shot by the Crusader police.\nKhayr Wilayah\nOn  the  15th  of  Dhul-Hijjah,  a  unit  of  inghimasiyyin  set  out  in  the  direction  of  the  Nusayri  army\u2019s  artillery battalion base southwest of the city of Khayr. They clashed with them using various types of weapons and the murtaddin fled in retreat from the artillery battalion base, leading to the complete capture of Mount Thardah, which overlooks the city\u2019s military airbase.\nJust one day after the blessed operation, Islamic State air  defense  units  shot  down  a  Nusayri  warplane  in  the city of Khayr after targeting it with antiaircraft guns. The plane  was  destroyed  and  its  pilot,  the  Nusayri  criminal Colonel \u2018Ali Hamzah, was killed.\n34\nNews\f35\n\f36\nArticle\f37\n\f38\nArticle\f", "schema:headline": "Operations", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "31"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah7-Foreword", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "destroyed.\nThe  murtaddin  of  \u201cThe  Euphrates  Shield,\u201d  from the Turkish  army  and  the  Sahwah  factions,  do  not conceal the real goal behind their attacks against the Islamic State. That is, the removal of Allah\u2019s rule from the earth and the return of those lands under its governance to the rule of Jahiliyyah, by way of shirki courts of  man-made  legislation  in  their  various  forms  and names and with their different jahili laws that support them.\nHowever, what has been hidden from many people is the reality that on their way to achieving that objective, they are prepared to destroy everything and kill every person in those lands. This includes killing those residents whom they claim to be striving to liberate from the obligations of the religion and the lawfulness of the Shari\u2019ah. This is demonstrated by their constant declaration  that  any  area  they  attack  is  a  \u201cmilitary zone,\u201d paving the way for them to shell it with whatever they have of weaponry. Then, the reality of this matter became ever so clear in every village or town that defied them in the northern and eastern countrysides of Halab Wilayah, with the destructive and haphazard  bombardment  from  the  apostate Turkish army\u2019s artillery and aircraft, supported by Russian and American Crusader aircraft, without any care for the number of victims from the dozens of families they \nForeword\nLikewise, it is obscure to many people that these murtaddin are prepared, in order to achieve their objective, to assist any side in fighting against the Islamic State. Be it the criminal Nusayri regime, for whom they  have  claimed  to  have  enmity  for  years,  or  the Russian Crusader army, who continuously bombard the people of Sham, the same people whom they have supposedly come out in order to support and relieve from  oppression.  And  this  is  aside  from  their  assistance to the American Crusaders, whom \u2013 only a few short years ago \u2013 they considered a great demon, cursing them and whomever convened with them.\nIt is also obscure to them that much of the tears that have been shed during the past years for the people of Sham \u2013 who have suffered greatly, at the hands of the Nusayri army and its allies of the Rafidah and Russian Crusaders, in loss of life and the destruction of their cities and villages \u2013 were only shed with the goal of inciting the people against a specific \u201cenemy,\u201d the Nusayri regime and its Rafidi and Russian allies \u2013 and not against everyone who kills the Muslims of Sham, destroying their homes and masajid over their heads and the heads of their children.\nThe  battles  that  have  ensued  in  the  city  of  Bab, between the allies of Rahman \u2013 the soldiers of the Is-\n\fWe would not be exaggerating if we were to say that hundreds  of  movements,  parties,  and  factions  have arisen over the course of the past century claiming to be working for the return of the khilafah, the implementation of the Shari\u2019ah, and the establishment of the religion on the earth. However, they all failed to achieve that, despite some of them having reached a stage of either actual consolidation or pseudo-consolidation. Among them were those who even managed to establish some of the rulings of the Shari\u2019ah, but the  aforementioned  aspirations  were  never  achieved in their entirety except by the Islamic State, and virtue has and always will belong to Allah.\nIf we were to look at the condition of those movements we would find that most of them created obstacles  and  obstructions  for  themselves  that  either blocked the path in front of them or forcefully pushed them to deviate from the single, true path that would lead to the lofty goal to which they aspired. They burdened themselves with that which Allah had not burdened them with and obligated upon themselves that which Allah had not obligated upon them, regardless of  whether  they  were  those  who  tread  the  path  of harshness, ghuluww (extremism), and imposing that which Allah had not obligated on them, or those who tread  the  path  of  fleeing  from  the  shar\u2019i  rulings.  In both cases, they became distant from the straight path and the upright methodology for establishing the religion.\nCorrupt Absolutes\nOne of the main things that they burdened themselves with is that which they innovated of work methodologies which their leaders, theorists, and scholars put  in  place  for  them,  giving  them  names  such  as political  theories,  movement  methodologies,  or  the likes of that, referring to what they\u2019ve imposed of prerequisites that are necessary for achieving the results that  they  aim  for  with  their  work  and  their  movement, such that their perceptions and desires inspired to them methods of work that should be followed in order  to  reach  the  desired  goal  \u2013  the  establishment of  Allah\u2019s  religion  on  the  earth.  And  they  were  not content  with  merely  putting  forth  these  theories  or hypotheses. Rather, they made them out to be equal to the straight path with respect to working for the establishment of Allah\u2019s religion, as it was incorrect \u2013 in their view \u2013 to follow anything else in order to reach the goal. As a result, they tread the path of absolutes \nand  burdened  themselves  and  their  followers  with that which they could not bear and that which had not been obligated on them. Thus, they increased in misguidance, and Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient  people.\nThese suppositions were based on the notion that the path towards establishing the religion should involve  reaching  a  level-based  goal  or  surmounting a  major  obstacle,  and  that  without  achieving  either one or the other it wouldn\u2019t be possible \u2013 according to them \u2013 to establish the religion or to speak of an Islamic state, let alone establish a khilafah upon the prophetic methodology and a greater imamah for a unified  ummah.\nThe biggest problem with their hypotheses is that it generally isn\u2019t possible to establish the correctness or incorrectness of a hypothesis without first putting it to the test. So if the result of the experiment backs up the hypothesis, then it has thus been proven and can be considered a correct theory. And if the theory is  repeatedly  successful  in  varying  circumstances,  it becomes an established formula through which one can gauge the results of any action or the future of any situation if the elements of that action and its situation correspond with the formula\u2019s pre-requisites. And this  is  where  the  trouble  lies  for  those  movements, because they would treat their hypotheses as if they were theories that had proven to be correct, or they would treat the theories of other groups \u2013 which those groups believed to be correctly applicable to their specific situations \u2013 as if they were established formulas that should be adhered to in every situation, era, and place.\nExperiments Whose Price Was Blood\nThe only way to test theories and hypotheses that concern humans \u2013 or a subsection of them \u2013 and everything related to their lives is for them to turn themselves  into  a  field  of  experiment,  by  pushing  themselves to apply their hypotheses, waiting for the results to appear in the real world, recording the results, and then  making  a  judgment  based  on  the  results  as  to the correctness of the hypothesis based on real world evidence. This means bearing a high cost for the sake of  reaching  the  desired  goal,  in  addition  to  bearing the heavy losses that can be expected if the basis of the hypothesis is mistaken, or if it is applied in an incorrect manner, or even if an influential variable or factor that wasn\u2019t previously anticipated enters the field of \n\f", "schema:headline": "Foreword", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah10-Interview-with-the-Amir-of-the-Soldiers-of-the-Khilafah-in-East-Asia", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "36INTERVIEW\nINTERVIEW\fTHE RUSSIAN ENVOY TO AFGHANISTAN SAID RUSSIA COMMUNICATES WITH THE TALIBAN, AND THAT THE ISLAMIC STATE IS THEIR COMMON ENEMY\njoint project between the Taliban movement and the nations of kufr, who were terrified by the presence of the Islamic State on their borders, just as its presence terrified the United States of America, which occupies Afghanistan.\nThe murtaddin of the Taliban then began to present fighting the Islamic State as an expensive commodity which every one of the states sought to purchase, and the price demanded in exchange was the commencement of relations with the Taliban\u2019s officials, and their securing  of  political  support,  and  possibly  financial support and weapons.\nDue to that it was not surprising that the Crusader Russians justified their open relations with the murtadd Taliban movement under the pretext that they are  aimed  at  fighting  the  Islamic  State,  displaying their fear of the spread of its soldiers in the vicinity of Russian interests in the region of Central Asia, while displaying at the same time their preparedness to enter militarily into a fight with the soldiers of the Khilafah in Khurasan Wilayah.\nWhat  concerns  Russia  \u2013  without  doubt  \u2013  is  distancing  the  Americans  from  their  border,  and  from their interests in the region of Central Asia, but that is without the withdrawal of America leading to the Islamic State taking its place, and sharing with them in that goal are China and Iran. They therefore seek to  fill  the  vacuum  that  emerges  in  the  case  of  the American withdrawal, whether that is through a direct presence \u2013 and that is difficult and expensive \u2013 or by turning Khurasan into a safe zone which its allies oversee in order to prevent their enemies from having a presence in what they consider a dangerous region. \nThe nationalist Taliban movement represents an ideal model as that ally, due to its ambitions being confined to a nationalist Afghanistan, and due to its tribal and madhhabi fanaticism, and its strong relationship with the Rafidi government of Iran, the closest ally to Russia in these days.\nIndeed, this murtadd movement, with its proposal to fight the Islamic State on behalf of the Crusader nations and tawaghit governments, is merely repeating what many other organizations and factions falsely claiming Islam had done before them, such as the Sahwah factions of Iraq, and their likes from the Sahwat of Sham and Libya, which the al-Qa\u2019idah organization \u2013 who have bay\u2019ah to the nationalist Taliban movement  \u2013  are  allied  to.  The  fate  of  this  murtadd movement, which many were deceived by, won\u2019t differ from the fate of the Sahwat of Iraq and Sham, by Allah\u2019s permission, and their allies will search for a replacement for them once they discover their inability to prevent the soldiers of the Khilafah from reaching them and striking them in their lands. Rather, they will discover their inability to protect even themselves, and their need for their protection.\nSo  let  the  soldiers  of  the  Khilafah  in  Khurasan complete what they have begun by fighting the Crusaders  and  murtaddin,  and  let  them  intensify  their punishment of all the enemies of Allah \u2013 as is their custom \u2013 and let them support Allah with their words and deeds, for neither mankind nor the Jinn shall triumph  over  them  even  if  they  were  to  unite  against them.

They make it lawful one year and unlawful another year to correspond to the number made unlawful by Allah, so they make lawful what Allah has made unlawful. The evil of their deeds is made pleasing to them, and Allah does not guide the disbelieving people\u201d (At-Tawbah 37). Ibn Kathir \uf072 said, \u201c[In Jahiliyyah], a man from Bani Kinanah would come each year in the season (of Hajj),  riding  a  donkey.  He  would  say,  \u2018O  people!  I am not at fault nor questioned, and there is no response to what I say! We have forbidden Muharram and have postponed Safar.\u2019 He would then come the next year and say instead, \u2018We have forbidden Safar and have postponed Muharram,\u2019 which is His saying, \u2018to correspond to the number made unlawful by Allah,\u2019 meaning the four months, \u2018so they make lawful what  Allah  has  made  unlawful,\u2019  by  postponing  this sacred  month.\u201d\nThus, the mushrikin do not honor the rites of Allah, nor His prohibitions, but only play with the religion of Allah and ridicule it, legislating into the religion that which Allah never permitted, and thereby they disbelieve in the whole religion.

And expelling the people of al-Masjid al-Haram from it \u2013 as they expelled Muhammad g \u2013 is a greater sin than killing, according to Allah.\u201d\nIt is reported that Allah \uf062 has written for \u2018Abdullah Ibn Jahsh \uf068 and his companions the reward of the mujahid muhajirin for what they did. Ibn Ishaq said, \u201cWhen it was clear to \u2018Abdullah Ibn Jahsh and his  companions  the  good  that  they  did,  as  revealed in the Quran, they were hopeful of being rewarded. They said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah! Should we hope to receive, for a raid we waged, the reward of mujahid muhajrin?\u2019 So Allah \uf062 revealed, \u2018Indeed, those who believed and those who emigrated and fought in the cause  of  Allah  \u2013  those  can  expect  the  mercy  of  Allah.

However,  the  truth  is  not  so. Their stance on this ruling was closer to mockery than esteem.  Whenever they found  it  difficult  to  cease fighting for three consecutive months, they resorted to something much greater in  sin  than  fighting:  they would  change  Allah\u2019s  ruling  and  legislate  over  His religion,  invoking  what  is known  as  the  \u201cnasi\u201d  (the postponing  of  a  month). That  was  in  order  to  permit fighting in one of the sacred  months,  in  which Allah forbade fighting, and then  to  substitute  that  by forbidding  combat  during a month in which fighting \n\f", "schema:headline": "And Do Not Weaken in Pursuing the Enemy", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "7"}, {"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "@type": "schema:Article"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah9-Interview-with-the-Amir-of-the-Soldiers-of-the-Khilafah-in-Misr", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "9", "schema:articleBody": "This month, Rumiyah had the opportunity to interview the amir of the soldiers of the Khilafah in Misr [commonly known as Egypt] and put forth a number of questions to him concerning the efforts of the mujahidin in the region to wage war against the  belligerent  Christians  and  their  taghut  allies who strive to protect them. \nQuestion: Tell us about the condition of the soldiers of the Khilafah in Misr and about the nature of their  operations.\nAnswer: All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the creation.

They clashed with an emergency forces regiment base in the city, killing those inside and burning  two  military  vehicles.  They  then  headed  to the home of the murtadd counterterrorism director, Khalid Muhammad Kassar al-Jamili, and killed both him and his son. They then entrenched themselves inside the murtaddin\u2019s buildings and clashed with them until their supply of ammo was exhausted, following which they detonated their explosive vests on them. The blessed operation resulted in more than 31 murtaddin being killed, among them 6 officers, and more than 40 others being wounded.\nOn the 9th of Rajab, the soldiers of the Khilafah carried out an attack on Rafidi army and Rafidi militia positions on two axes north of the city of Bayji. The first axis was on the Asmidah and Makhazin bridges and the neighboring villages, where clashes took place for a long period of time and were accompanied by istishhadi operations carried out with explosive vehicles that targeted the gatherings of the murtaddin, leading \nAbu Khattab ash-Shami \uf08a, one of the inghimasiyyin who infiltrated Takrit\nto 16 vehicles and two Abrams tanks being destroyed, more  than  30  murtaddin  being  killed,  a  number  of others being wounded, 30 barracks being destroyed, a helicopter being hit, a reconnaissance plane being shot down, and three vehicles as well as a variety of weapons and ammo being taken as ghanimah. The second axis was on the road between Bayji and Hadithah, where an  attack  was  carried  out  and  was  accompanied  by two istishhadi operations with two explosive vehicles targeting the gatherings of the murtaddin. The attack and two istishhadi operations resulted in more than 15 murtaddin being killed and wounded, 17 barracks and a number of vehicles being destroyed, and several others being disabled.\nRussia\nThe soldiers of the Khilafah killed two Russian policemen and wounded three members of the Russian National  Guard  in  two  attacks  in  the  city  of  Astrakhan, one on the 7th of Rajab and the other two days later on the 9th of Rajab.\nOn the 24th of Rajab, a number of Islamic State soldiers attacked an office of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) in the city of Khabarovsk in Far Eastern Russia and succeeded in killing three of their personnel and in injuring a number of others.\nOn the 12th of Rajab, Abul-Bara al-Misri \uf08a set \nMisr\n\f", "schema:headline": "Establishing the Islamic State: Part 3", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "35"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah11-The-Twelver-Rafidah-Devour-Their-own-Idols", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "In the last three parts of this series we covered the development  of  the  religion  of  the  mushrik  Twelver Rafidah and how their religion was built entirely on the corrupt principle of \u201cthe divine imamah,\u201d which confines the right of leadership to a group of people whom they claim deserve it due to a covenant from Allah \uf063 and due to inheriting their authority from the Prophet g.\nWe discovered how they added to and subtracted from  their  religion  over  the  course  of  the  past  centuries, due to the wavering nature of their religion\u2019s foundation and their constant need to reinforce it with more lies and superstitions, which did not end when \nthey invented a personality whom they claim to have been born to a man who in reality did not have any children and then invented for him the story of his absence. They then connected his tale with the story of \u2018Abdullah al-Mahdi whom the Muslims will appoint over their affairs at the end of times, and who will lead them in fighting the Dajjal and the mushrikin with him.\nIn this part of the series in which we conclude our discussion  of  the  Twelver  Rafidi  experiment  to  establish a so-called Islamic State, we will endeavor to complete the story of the development of the religion of these people, and will arrive at the most recent of \n22ARTICLE\nARTICLE\fimpermissible to violate. The condition of these scholars is like that of the Jews about whom Allah \uf063 said, \u201cAmong  the  Jews  are  those  who  distort  words  from their [proper] usages\u201d (An-Nisa 46).\nKilling  the  kuffar  in  their  own  lands  or  stealing their wealth are among the issues widely discussed by the fuqaha. However, these taghut scholars promoted the fiqh of pacifism, strove to erase these issues from the  religion  of  Islam,  replace  them  with  the  manhaj of  humiliation  and  subservience  to  the  kuffar,  and subjugate the people to the new religion they had established, which was built on the foundation of \u201cthe peaceful co-existence of all religions,\u201d the solidification of \u201cthe principles of Islam,\u201d pacifism, and the abolishment of jihad.\nSuddenly,  you  find  many  of  those  who  associate themselves with knowledge and Islam almost agreeing on  prohibiting  a  matter  on  whose  permissibility  the Ummah  previously  had  ijma\u2019.  And  this  wouldn\u2019t  be strange if we were to reflect on the statement made by Anas Ibn Malik \uf068 when az-Zuhri entered upon him in Dimashq and said to him, \u201cWhat is it that is making you weep?\u201d So Anas said, \u201cI could not recognize anything [of the acts of worship] that I had come to witness except for the prayer, and now even the prayer has been lost\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari).\nSo how would it be if he were to have reached our era, in which clear rulings in the Book of Allah, the sunnah of Allah\u2019s Messenger g, and the ijma\u2019 of the Salaf have been wiped out? And among the rulings that have been done away with is the ruling on the blood and  wealth  of  the  harbi  (belligerent)  kuffar,  and  the fact that their blood does not have \u2018ismah (protection from being violated) except through their embracing of  Islam  or  through  a  covenant  that  is  valid  in  the Shari\u2019ah, and as such, it is permitted for the Muslim to shed their blood and take their wealth as he wishes, in accordance with the example of the Prophet g and his noble companions \uf073. But you find today that the scholars and the callers to misguidance criticize the muwahhidin and accuse them of distorting the image of Islam on account of the very deeds that were carried out by the Sahabah, such as Abu Basir and Abu Jandal \uf06b. And at the same time, you do not hear from them a single word when their masters from among the tawaghit of the West and the East loot the wealth of the Muslims. And indeed, the Islamic State has taken it upon its shoulders to wage jihad against the enemies of  this  religion  \u2013  from  among  the  kuffar  and  murtaddin \u2013 with sword and spear, and with proofs and \nclarifications until the religion is entirely for Allah and until there returns the Muslims their religion, clear and pure, as it had been before. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cAnd fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah. And if they cease - then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do\u201d (Al-Anfal 39).\nIn  this  article,  we  will  clarify  the  ruling  on  the wealth of the harbi kuffar in their lands, and demonstrate that what is taken from them can include that which is ghanimah, that which is fay, and that which is  talassus  and  ihtitab  (wealth  taken  through  fraud and deception). We will also mention the statements of some scholars on this subject and respond to some misconceptions. Likewise, we will not miss the opportunity to mention some of the benefits of taking their wealth in the framework of the comprehensive war between the Khilafah state and the nations of kufr altogether. And it is Allah who grants success and who guides to the straight path.\nThe Blood and Wealth of the Harbi Kafir Is \nPermissible to Violate\nThe default with regards to the blood and wealth of the harbi kuffar is that it does not have \u2018ismah. The scholars have an ijma\u2019 that the ruling of Allah concerning the harbi kuffar is that neither their blood nor their wealth has \u2018ismah. Rather, both their blood and wealth are permissible for the Muslims.\nImam Ibn Taymiyyah r said, \u201cAnd kufr alongside muharabah (belligerence) is present in every kafir, so it is permitted to enslave him just as it is permitted to kill him\u201d (Majmu\u2019 al-Fatawa).\nAnd  indeed,  the  harbi  kuffar  \u2013  according  to  the terminology of the fuqaha \u2013 are not only those kuffar who are at war with the Muslims. Rather, the harbi kuffar  include  all  those  to  whom  the  Muslims  have not granted security, either with a dhimmah contract, a covenant of security, or a ceasefire treaty, regardless of whether they are soldiers enlisted in the military, or non-combatants and others from among the common masses of the kuffar. Their blood and wealth is permissible for the Muslims, and this ruling encompasses all mushrikin  everywhere.  Allah \uf063  said,  \u201cThen  kill  the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and  give  zakah,  let  them  [go]  on  their  way.  Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful\u201d (At-Tawbah 5).

I  bear  witness  that  there  is  no god except Allah, alone and without partner, and I bear witness that Muhamad is His slave and messenger. As for what follows:\nIn this article we will discuss the rule of the Shari\u2019ah, which is underataken by the Khalifah and his aides \u2013 may Allah grant them success \u2013 and which every soldier of the Islamic State works to safeguard, sacrificing their lives and everything dear to them for the sake of elevating it.\nAllah sent His Messenger g with the call to tawhid in Allah\u2019s Lordship, in one\u2019s worship towards Him, and in His names and attributes, and even though the people of \n6ARTICLEARTICLE\n\fsituation after death is as Allah g said, \u201c\u2018My Lord, send me back. That I might do righteousness in that which I left behind\u2019\u201d (AlMuminun 99-100). So will man then not take heed and busy himself  with  Allah\u2019s  obedience  and  with  seeking  His  pleasure while his soul is still within him? The Messenger of Allah g said, \u201cO Allah there is no life except the life of the Hereafter. Forgive the Ansar and the Muhajirin\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).Contemplate on his g statement, and his negation that the enjoyments of this Dunya be a real sense of living worthy of the effort of those pursuing it, because in reality the real life is that of the Hereafter in Allah\u2019s Jannah.\nO, I Wish I Had Sent Ahead [Some Good] for My Life\nIndeed, many people have lost the balance between the actions of the Dunya and the actions of the Hereafter \u2013 not reconciling between  them.  Thus,  the  extent  of  most  of  their  concerns  is accumulating wealth and wasting it on permissible things, and so you see them in affluence and with what suffices for living but yet they are poor when it comes to those deeds that lead to success in Allah\u2019s Jannah and to His pleasure. And thus Allah blessed them with the gift of spare time and yet they utilized it to occupy themselves with the Dunya, though they weren\u2019t even in need of it. In truth, that is the one who is heedless, as was reported by Ibn \u2018Abbas h when he said, \u201cThe Prophet g said, \u2018There are two blessings which most people are heedless of: Heath and spare time\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari).\nO you who has been blessed with wealth and spare time, you who are distracted by your Dunya, you are indeed amongst those deprived,  for  you  did  not  give  true  value  to  the  time  that  has passed of your life, contrary to what is known of the people of high ambition, those who don\u2019t find any spare time due to their performance of deeds and their jihad, whereas you who has been blessed with spare time are headed towards a grave matter that may have been obscured from you and which you were heedless of, a moment in which you will say, \u201c\u2018O, I wish I had sent ahead [some good] for my life\u2019\u201d (Al-Fajr 24). Imam at-Tabari r said, \u201cAllah g says, while informing of the sorrow of the son of Adam on the Day of Judgment, and his regret over his negligence in performing righteous deeds in the Dunya which would have inherited him an eternal stay in bliss that has no end, O I wish I had sent ahead for my life in the world righteous deeds for myself in this life \u2013 after which there is no death \u2013 deeds that would have saved me from the anger of Allah and granted me His pleasure\u201d (Jami\u2019 al-Bayan).Indeed, there is he whom Allah has bestowed His blessings upon and thus sufficed with regards to the provisions of living, but he was careless, lost in heedlessness regarding the orders of his Lord, not busying his spare time in understanding his religion and what Allah demands of him. Rather, he was occupied with the haram, or excessiveness in that which is permissible. O confused \nand heedless one, prepare many answers for the many questions that are coming, for by Allah you were not created in play nor left without aim, and you shall be asked about your spare time and how you spent it.\nWith Every Day That Passes You, a Piece \nof You Departs\nFrom them is he who grows old and whose back becomes crooked while he possesses what would assist him in his worldly affairs of wealth and children, and Allah surely blessed him with such great blessings of spare time, but he did not know how take advantage of it. As for he whose situation is as such, reflect extensively about those years which you have spent while not attaining your share of the Hereafter. Reflect on how close you are to meeting your Lord. Is now not the time for you to incite your children and descendants to sacrifice for the religion of Allah and support it? Is now not the time for you to dedicate your time  to  Allah  and  to  supplicating  for  yourself, the oppressed Muslims, and the mujahid slaves of Allah? Is now not the time to devote yourself to  Allah  and  draw  closer  to  Him  through  the various methods of drawing oneself close.\nThere are many people who reach a very old age,  and  then  you  find  them  living  with  the absent-minded mentality of the youth, those who don\u2019t think about death, the hour of questioning and  account,  and  by  Allah,  that  is  in  reality nothing but high expectations of living a long life and it is the essence of destruction. So where are you in relation to the statement of Allah g, \u201cAnd there has come the intoxication of death with the truth; that is what you were trying to avoid\u201d (Qaf 19)? Imam al-Baghawi said, \u201c\u2018And there has come the intoxication of death\u2019: pains and agonies that envelope mankind and overcome his mind, \u2018with the truth\u2019: meaning the reality of death. And it was said, \u2018with the truth\u2019: meaning the matter of the Hereafter, such that mankind sees it clearly with his own eyes. And it was said: with what the affair of mankind returns to of either bliss or misery. And it is said to the one whom the intoxication of death has come to: \u2018that is what you  were  trying  to  avoid\u2019:  incline  away  from, and al-Hasan al-Basri said: to flee from, and Ibn \u2018Abbas said: [that is what you] hate\u201d (Ma\u2019alim at-\nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "The Rule of the Shari'ah Not the Rule of Jahiliyyah", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "5"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3-Sultan-Mahmud-al-Ghaznawi", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "3", "schema:articleBody": "The breaking and burning of idols is a major aspect of rejecting taghut and something that the prophets all practiced. Among the famous examples was that of Ibrahim \uf06e, who smashed the idols of his people with an axe, and Musa \uf06e, who melted the gold calf worshiped  by  Bani  Israil.  Likewise,  the  Seal  of  the Prophets,  Muhammad \uf06d,  destroyed  the  Arab  idols in Makkah, burning and demolishing al-Lat, al-\u2018Uzza, Manat, Hubal, and others. Thereafter, the Sahabah and the Tabi\u2019in treaded that same path, as do those today who follow that same guidance.\nWe  also  find  in  the  later  history  of  the  Muslim Ummah those who followed the prophets \uf070 by making the destruction of mushrik idols their greatest priority in life. They strove to that end and fought for it, crossing great deserts and confronting many perils in order to reach this goal. Among them was the warrior Mahmud Ibn Subuktikin \uf072, whom people nicknamed \u201cthe Breaker of Idols\u201d due to the numerous and significant idols he destroyed. This was only one of his many great traits, as he was also known for supporting the  Sunnah,  subduing  bid\u2019ah  (heretical  innovation), and bringing unity to the Muslims by pledging bay\u2019ah to the \u2018Abbasi khalifah and obeying him.\nSultan Mahmud Ibn Subuktikin was born in Muharram  of  the  year  360AH  in  the  city  of  Ghaznah, Khurasan. He became the ruler of the land after the death of his father in the year 387AH, thereafter devoting himself to waging jihad against the mushrikin of India, destroying their idols, and spreading Islam in  their  lands.  It  was  in  the  year  396AH  that  this Sultan Mahmud al-Ghaznawi marched to the fort of Kawakir, which housed six hundred pagan idols. After conquering the fort, he burned all of the idols therein (Ibnul-Athir:  Al-Kamil).\nIn the year 398AH, al-Ghaznawi returned to raiding India. Ibnul-Athir said, \u201cHe reached the banks of the Indus River and was met there by Anandapala [the Indian king] with the armies of India. They fought all day until it seemed that the Indians would defeat the Muslims, but then Allah \uf063 supported him over them. The Muslims defeated the Indians and sent them fleeing or killed them by the sword. Yamin ad-Dawlah [i.e. al-Ghaznawi] followed Anandapala to the fort at Bahim Naghar, which was on a high mountain. The fort was taken by the Indians as a treasury for one of their largest idols\u2026 When the Indians saw the magnitude of his force, their sheer desire to fight, and their continuous march towards them, they were taken by \n36Article\nfear and cowardice, requested amnesty, and opened the gate of the fortress. The Muslims took control of the fort and Yamin ad-Dawlah  ascended,  along  with  his  closest  companions  and trusted friends, and collected an undefined amount of jewels, as well as ninety million Shahi dirhams\u201d (Al-Kamil). Thus, Allah humiliated the mushrikin and their tawaghit. Their idols were destroyed  and  the  Muslims  seized  all  that  was  offered  to  the largest idol of India of precious metals and jewels.\nThe  Sultan  did  the  same  in  400AH,  marching  into  India, pillaging it, and destroying the idols therein. In the year 405AH,  he  marched  on  Thanesar.  Ibnul-Athir  said,  \u201cWhen they came near their destination, they found a river with a fast current, which would be difficult to ford, and the leader of those lands stood on its banks to prevent anyone from crossing, having his soldiery and war elephants with him for this task. Yamin ad-Dawlah then ordered the bravest of his army to cross the river and engage the kuffar with combat, which they did, in order to allow the rest of the army to cross. They fought the Indians and kept them engaged until the rest of the army managed to ford the then undefended river and fought then on all fronts for the rest of the day. The Indians were defeated, the Muslims were victorious, and they seized what the enemy brought of wealth and elephants.\u201d\nArticle\fand  relatives.  As  for  her  going  out  becoming  a  habitual,  regular  practice,  then  such  is  at  variance  with  the Shari\u2019ah by diverging from the default rule, which is that women should stay home.\nIn  this  regards,  the  Muslim  woman  should  consider the hadith of the Prophet \uf067, in which he said, \u201cDo not  prevent  your  women  from  the  masajid,  however, their homes are better for them\u201d (Reported by Ahmad, Abu  Dawud,  Ibn  Khuzaymah,  al-Hakim,  and  ad-Diya from Ibn \u2018Umar). The masjid is the house of Allah and the most beloved of places to Him \uf063, and prayer is the pillar of the religion, yet the Shari\u2019ah does not require that women pray in congregation, which has been made obligatory on men. But instead, it has made her prayer in her home better for her than going out to witness the congregational  prayer  in  the  masjid.  Indeed,  this  is  to further safeguard the woman and shield her from view as much as possible. The Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cThe woman is \u2018awrah [something that should be covered]. When she goes out, Shaytan stares at her [or adorns her]. And she is closest to Allah when she is inside her home\u201d (Reported by Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban from Ibn Mas\u2019ud).The Muslim woman who is veiled in accordance with the  Shari\u2019ah  should  not  assume  that  her  veil  distances her from this hadith or that the woman is only \u2018awrah when  she  is  unveiled  or  adorned.  Rather  she  is  \u2018awrah whenever she leaves her home, even if she is not revealing anything of herself. May Allah have mercy upon the great Tabi\u2019i  Sufyan  ath-Thawri  \uf072,  who  said,  \u201cThere  is nothing better for a woman than her home, even if she is very old\u201d (At-Tahawi: Mukhtasar Ikhtilaf al-\u2018Ulama).Simply leaving her home could be a fitnah for her, for those men who see her, or for both her and the men, especially if she speaks with them. For this reason, Allah \uf063 said to the wives of the Prophet \uf067, \u201cSo do not be soft in speech, lest someone with a disease in his heart becomes desirous\u201d (Al-Ahzab 32), and being soft in speech means to speak weakly with a soft voice, the result of which is that \u201csomeone with a disease in his heart becomes desirous.\u201d If this is said of someone in the generation of the Prophet \uf067 and his noble companions \uf06a, which was the best of generations, then what about in our time, a time of fitan and grievous sin? Indeed, \u2018Amrah narrated that \u2018Aishah \uf069 said, \u201cIf Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 saw what women have devised, he would prevent them from going to the masjid just as the women of Bani Israil were prevented.\u201d \u2018Amrah was then asked, \u201cWere [the women of Bani Israil] prevented from going to the masjid?\u201d He replied, \u201cYes\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nSubhanallah! This is what \u2018Aishah \u2013 the scholar of fiqh and  hadith  \uf069  \u2013  concluded  based  on  what  she  saw  of innovations and transgressions from some of the women in her era. What if she were to have witnessed our time?! Rather, what if the Prophet \uf067 were to see what the women of today \u2013 other than those whom Allah has saved \u2013 are doing?!\nThose who like to wander about the pasturelands of shubuhat (doubtful matters) should place the aforementioned statement of Umm al-Muminin \u2018Aishah directly in  front  of  their  eyes  when  they  give  fatawa  regarding \nrulings related to women, fatawa that have caused women to leave their homes without any regulations, for no need, benefit, or necessity, even multitudes of times in a single day, rather, even if she were in \u2018iddah, mourning a husband who has passed away!\nImam Ahmad \uf072 was asked about women going out for the two Eids, to which he replied, \u201cI do not like that.\u201d Ibnul-Mubarak  \uf072  said,  \u201cI  dislike  that  women  go  out these  days  during  the  two  Eids\u201d  (At-Tirmidhi:  As-Sunan).  Abu  Hanifah  said,  \u201cWomen  were  allowed  to  go out to the Eid prayers. As for today, I dislike that they do so\u201d (Ibn \u2018Abdil-Barr: At-Tamhid).1\nIf these fuqaha \u2013 for the sake of repelling evils they perceived  then  \u2013  disliked  a  woman\u2019s  going  out  to  perform  a  great  deed  in  Islam,  how  about  her  going  out time and again in our era, until she becomes infamous for  doing  so?\nAllah \uf063 described the Hur al-\u2018In in the Quran as \u201crestricted to pavilions\u201d (Ar-Rahman 72). Al-Qurtubi said, \u201cHis saying \u2018restricted\u2019 means confined and covered, and \u2018to  pavilions\u2019  means  dome-like  compartments  covered with cloth. These women do not wander the streets. This is what Ibn \u2018Abbas said.\u201d The Jannah is perfect, containing no fitnah, no perversion, and no deviance, and yet the  Hur  are  restricted  to  pavilions  for  their  husbands, who will be the only ones who see them.\nFinally,  the  Muslim  man  must  remember  that  his wives are part of his flock, for whom he is responsible. The man should not let his wife have free rein in this regards. Instead, he can prevent her if she goes out too often. May Allah be pleased with \u2018Umar, who would have prevented one of his wives from going to the masjid, due to his protective jealousy for her, if it were not for the hadith  of  the  Prophet  \uf067  against  doing  so.  Ibn  \u2018Umar \uf068  narrated,  \u201cOne  of  \u2018Umar\u2019s  women  would  pray  the Fajr and \u2018Isha prayers in the masjid, so it was said to her, \u2018Why do you go out, while you know that \u2018Umar dislikes so and is jealous?\u2019 She said, \u2018Why does he not forbid me then?\u2019  They  said,  \u2018What  prevents  him  is  the  saying  of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067, \u2018Do not prevent the maidservants of  Allah  from  the  masajid  of  Allah\u2019\u201d  (Reported  by  alBukhari and Muslim).\nYes,  there  is  nothing  wrong  with  Muslim  women visiting each other, nor with keeping families ties, nor with her going to the market.

Unlike man-made systems, the law of the Shari\u2019ah is divine and flawless. There is no doubt in its authority and no suspicion of its perfection. Allah \uf062 said, \u201cWe have not neglected anything in the Book\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 38). Likewise, He said, \u201cDo that which is good\u201d (Al-Hajj 77), showing that anything Allah commands is good and its outcome should not be regretted.\nAllah \uf066 has ordered the killing of all mushrikin1 \u2013 whether military or civilian \u2013 in His saying, \u201cThen kill the mushrikin wherever you find them\u201d (At-Tawbah 5), which was reiterated by the Prophet \uf067, who said, \u201cI have been ordered to fight mankind until they testify that nothing is worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah\u2026\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar). Like many other rulings in the Shari\u2019ah, this general obligation to kill the mushrikin has its specific  exceptions,  among  which  is  women  and children. In one of the Prophet\u2019s raids, a woman was found killed, upon which he \uf067 denounced and for-\n1   For more, see Rumiyah, issue 1, \u201cThe Kafir\u2019s Blood Is Halal for You, So Shed It.\u201d\nbade the killing of women and children (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar), thereby setting the principle of prohibition in this issue.Commenting on this principle, ash-Shafi\u2019i said, \u201cOur opinion regarding this \u2013 and Allah knows best \u2013 is that the restriction exists so that they can become slaves, which is more beneficial than killing them\u201d (Al-Umm). This is supported by the statement of the Prophet \uf067, \u201cAllah dislikes that you do three things: gossiping, excessive questioning, and wasting wealth\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim  from  al-Mughirah  Ibn  Shu\u2019bah),  and  women and children of the uncovenanted kuffar are wealth \u2013 and wasted if killed.\nHowever, this principle also has its exceptions. There  is  no  disagreement  amongst  Muslims  that women are eligible to be killed for crimes like murder and adultery. Likewise, both women and children  who  participate  in  fighting  against  Muslims are exempted from this prohibition. That is, killing those women and children who participate in the war against Muslims is not forbidden \u2013 but rather even necessary. Ibn Battal said, \u201cThe majority agreed that women and children who fight are to be killed, and  such  is  the  opinion  of  Malik,  al-Layth,  Abu Hanifah, ath-Thawri, al-Awza\u2019i, ash-Shafi\u2019i, Ahmad, \n6Exclusive\nArticle\fand readily accessible materials (i.e. flammables), one can easily terrorize an entire nation. This is a quick option for anyone intending to join the just terror campaign.\nArson,  as  it  applies  to  the  just  terror  mujahid,  is  to initiate fires by using flammables to destroy the property of the Crusaders and, in some cases, kill several of them, sending them from the fire of this world to the inferno of Hellfire.1 All that is required of the mujahid is to acquire the flammable he wishes to use, select his target, and determine the best time for execution.\nBecause many flammables are a part of everyday living, arson attacks are extremely difficult to prevent. Indeed, no more than a large container of gasoline (petrol) is needed for a successful attack. Of course, the gasoline can be acquired from any local gas station, where it is filled into the container. This procedure should not arouse any suspicion, as it is quite common to follow, especially when obtaining gas for a lawnmower, amongst other reasons.\nHow to Make a Molotov Cocktail and Napalm\nMolotov cocktails are infamous for wreaking destruction with minimal effort and can be useful in an extended arson  campaign  against  the  Crusader  enemy.  Moreover, preparing a Molotov cocktail is a simple procedure requiring very basic and easily attainable components, these being:\n-  a large gasoline container-  a funnel-  a medium-sized empty glass bottle-  a piece of cloth, or a rag, or paper towels-  enough gas to almost fill the glass bottle-  a working lighter or matches to ignite the Molotov before launching it at the target\nSteps for Making a Molotov Cocktail\nFirst, the empty glass bottle is filled with gasoline using a funnel, leaving only a small space unfilled. The piece of cloth is then inserted into the bottle, all the way to the bottom, so that it can soak in the gasoline, while the other end of the cloth protrudes through the bottle\u2019s mouth, enough so as to set it alight without any difficulty. The protruding end should also be soaked in gasoline, to allow for quick ignition when lit. The bottle\u2019s mouth must then \n1   Note that the Prophet\u2019s \uf067 saying, \u201cDo not punish with the punishment of Allah\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Ibn \u2018Abbas) refers to using fire as a punishment against prisoners, unless they had a role in the burning of Muslims, in which case, the prisoners can be burned retributively; see \u201cThe Flames of Justice\u201d in this issue of Rumiyah. Likewise, the usage of fire is permissible in open combat and covert operations, as the Prophet \uf067 burned down the date palm trees of Bani an-Nadir while  besieging  them,  causing  widespread  fire  thereby  (Reported  by al-Bukhari from Ibn \u2018Umar). This ruling is supported by the opinion of the majority of scholars, who hold the ruling on using fire against the unsubdued enemy to be like that on killing the enemy\u2019s women and children collaterally by way of catapults, night raids, etc., which is permissible; see \u201cCollateral Carnage\u201d in this issue of Rumiyah. How much more of a necessity is \u201cfire\u201d today in combat and covert ops with almost all modern weaponry utilizing intense heat and explosions to hurt and kill the enemy?\nbe sealed, not allowing any gasoline to spill. This can be done by firmly reapplying the bottle\u2019s lid, or plugging its mouth  with  a  cork  plug  cut  to  the  required  size,  or  by securely taping up the bottle mouth using strong electrical (insulating) tape and an appropriately sized piece of a plastic bag.\nDue to the fast rate at which gasoline burns away, it is better that one transforms the contents of his Molotov cocktail  into  a  sticky,  long-burning  napalm  solution,  to ensure \u2013 by Allah\u2019s permission \u2013 that the intended target properly catches fire before the gas finishes burning.\nSteps for Making a Napalm Molotov Cocktail\nAll  that  is  required  are  pieces  of  polystyrene  (Styrofoam), which is commonly found in boxed packaging of children\u2019s toys and household appliances or in the form of foam cups used for hot coffee at donut shops. One only has to pack the pieces of crushed foam inside the bottle (two thirds of which is filled with gasoline), gently shaking it, until the polystyrene dissolves, turning the mixture into a thick solution. He should continue adding polystyrene until the desired sticky glue-type consistency is reached. This stickiness will assist in allowing the area of the Molotov cocktail\u2019s impact to burn for a longer period. Alternatively, instead of Styrofoam, one can add liquid laundry detergent or dishwashing liquid in the same manner, to thicken  the  gasoline  and  slow  its  burning.  The  piece  of cloth is then inserted into the bottle, the protruding end should be soaked in gasoline, and the bottle\u2019s mouth must then be sealed as explained before. Also, the exterior of the bottle should be cleansed of any napalm.\nAdditionally, if needed for the arson attack, the mixture can be prepared and stored in a larger container and poured directly on the intended target before lighting the fire.\nHow to Use the Molotov Cocktail\nThe mechanism of the Molotov cocktail is simple. It is not an explosive requiring a detonator. Rather, once a naked flame makes contact with the solution inside the glass bottle, ignition occurs. Therefore, the Molotov cocktail should be launched at a hard surface of the intended target,  shortly  after  lighting  the  protruding  cloth.  This will cause the glass bottle to smash, allowing the enflamed cloth to make contact with the flammable solution contained inside the bottle, igniting it and whatever the solution makes contact with.\nIdeal Target Locations\nIdeal  target  locations  for  arson  include  houses  and apartment buildings, forest areas adjacent to residential areas, factories that produce cars, furniture, clothing, flammable substances, etc., gas stations, hospitals, bars, dance clubs,  night  clubs,  banks,  car  showrooms,  schools,  universities, as well as churches, Rafidi temples, and so forth. The options are vast, leaving no excuse for delay.\n\f", "schema:headline": "Collateral Carnage", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "5"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah9-The-Ruling-on-the-Belligerent-Christians", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "9", "schema:articleBody": "Feature\n\ftilated his body.

Their sinful tongues and filthy pens even go so far as to give those harbi (belligerent) kuffar  protection  with  respect  to  their  blood  and  their wealth,  and  to  defame  the  noble  muwahhidin,  who carried out Allah\u2019s judgment on the mushrikin and, through their blessed deeds \u2013 not just their words \u2013 revived shar\u2019i rulings which the tawaghit and their allies endeavored to either wipe out or replace.\nFrom among these blessed deeds were the successive attacks which the soldiers of the Islamic State in Misr1 and Sinai carried out against the Christians in those  lands,  targeting  them  with  killings  and  assassinations, and afflicting their churches with burning and  explosions.  Thus,  they  brought  upon  them  tremendous detriment and deepened their wounds. The last of the blessed attacks against them were the simultaneous  explosions  at  two  of  their  largest  churches, one in northern Misr and the other in southern Misr, in the cities of Alexandria and Tanta on their holiday on the 12th of the month of Rajab in the year 1438. More than 200 of the Christian mushrikin and their supporters  from  among  the  murtadd  soldiers  of  the taghut were killed and wounded, and to Allah belongs all praise.\nIn this brief article we will attempt to shed light on the condition of the Christians in Misr, as well as the ruling of Islam concerning their blood, their wealth, their honor, and their churches, so that those who live may  live  upon  evidence  and  those  who  perish  may perish upon evidence. And it is Allah who guides to the straight path.\nSo Kill the Mushrikin Wherever You Find Them\nThe default with regards to the blood of mushrikin is that it is permissible to shed, due to the statement of \n1  Misr is the Arabic name for the land commonly known as Egypt.\nAllah c, \u201cAnd when the sacred months have passed, then kill the musrhikin wherever you find them and capture  them  and  besiege  them  and  sit  in  wait  for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful\u201d (At-Tawbah 5). Committing shirk with Allah is a sin that makes one permissible to be killed, and believing in Him gives one protection, as the Prophet g said, \u201cI was commanded to fight the people until they say \u2018La  ilaha  illallah,\u2019  so  whoever  says  \u2018La  ilaha  illallah\u2019 has protected from me his wealth and his life except by its right (i.e. by the right of \u2018La ilaha illallah\u2019) and his reckoning is upon Allah\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nThe mushrikin cannot render their blood inviolable except through a dhimmah contract, or a covenant of security or safety. The inviolability of their blood in such cases would be an exceptional ruling, and whenever that ruling is terminated \u2013 either due to their violation of the covenant, or due to the expiry of the duration of the covenant of security or safety \u2013 their blood  would  go  back  to  the  default  ruling  of  it  being permissible to shed, and there is no disagreement among the Muslims in that regard.\nNo Protection for Their Blood Except through \nFaith or a Covenant of Security\nThe Christians in Misr and in other lands of the Muslims  are  from  among  those  for  whom  Allah  c permitted  that  they  protect  their  blood  by  entering under  the  dhimmah  (liability)  of  the  Muslims  and paying the jizyah in humiliation, due to the statement of Allah c, \u201cFight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture \u2013 [fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled\u201d (At-Tawbah 29).\nIf they do that, then their blood, wealth, and honor become  protected  except  by  the  right  of  Islam,  and there are many, well-known texts which emphasize the inviolability of the blood of the mu\u2019ahadin (those with covenants  of  security),  the  dhimmiyyin  (those  with contracts  of  dhimmah),  and  those  with  covenants of safety. From among them is the statement of the Prophet g, \u201cWhoever kills a person who\u2019s been given a covenant will not smell the fragrance of Jannah, and \n\f", "schema:headline": "Contents", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "1"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah2-Just-Terror-Tactics", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "2", "schema:articleBody": "the striking of the enemy in war. However, any such squirms and discomforts are never an excuse for abandoning jihad, as the All-Knowing and  Most  Wise  said,  \u201cFighting  has  been  enjoined upon you while it contains that which you dislike. But perhaps you dislike a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah knows, while you know not\u201d (Al-Baqarah 216). In compliance with this and other verses on jihad, generations  upon  generations  of  mujahidin  rose for the sake of Allah \uf065 and struck the necks of the kuffar with their swords, severing limbs and piercing the fleshy meat of those who opposed  Islam.  \u201cSo  when  you  meet  those  who disbelieve, strike their necks, until, when you have overwhelmed them with killing \u2026\u201d (Muhammad 4).\nThe knife was a weapon with which the Sahabah \uf06a were well acquainted. \u2018Abdur-Razzaq as-San\u2019ani reported in his musannaf that a dagger, a type of knife, was the weapon used by Muhammad Ibn Maslamah \uf068 in the assassination of the Jewish taghut Ka\u2019b Ibn al-Ashraf, whom Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 ordered be killed.One might ask why knives are a good option for an attack. Knives, though certainly not the only weapon for inflicting harm upon the kuffar,  are  widely  available  in  every  land  and \nWhen considering a just terror operation,1 an ocean of thoughts might pour into one\u2019s mind, clouding the ability to make a final decision. Whether in regards to the type of operation one seeks to conduct or the details of that operation, it is easy for someone to be defeated by doubt if they have not received proper guidance or training. Yet, one need not be a military expert or a martial arts master, or even own a gun or rifle in order to carry out a massacre or to kill and injure several disbelievers and terrorize an entire nation. A hardened resolve, some basic planning, and reliance on Allah for success are enough for a single mujahid to bring untold misery to the enemies of Allah, in shaallah.\nKnife Attacks\nMany people are often squeamish of the thought of plunging a sharp object into another person\u2019s flesh. It is a discomfort caused by the untamed, inherent dislike for pain and death, especially after \u201cmodernization\u201d distanced males from partaking in the slaughtering of livestock for food and \n1   Instead of using the term \u201clone wolf,\u201d we will refer to operations in Dar al-Kufr executed by mujahidin with bay\u2019ah to the Khalifah \uf085 as \u201cjust terror operations,\u201d \u201cjust\u201d being the adjective form for justice. \n12Exclusive\nExclusive\fDay of Judgment, nor look at him, nor purify him, and he would have a tormenting punishment, losing thereby both the Dunya and the Akhirah, and that is the clear loss. As for the blessing of the Jama\u2019ah, the blessing of succession to authority in the land, the blessing of consolidation for the religion, then without this, the individual is overpowered and afflicted with trials and calamities until the wolves devour him and he then dies a death of Jahiliyyah, and Allah\u2019s refuge is sought.\nAs for His statement, \u201cthen mention it,\u201d \u2018Umar Ibn \u2018Abdil-\u2018Aziz \uf072 (d. 101AH) said, \u201cMentioning a blessing is a part of being grateful.\u201d Al-Jariri (d. 144AH) and Yahya Ibn Sa\u2019id (d. 143AH) \uf074 said, \u201cIt used to be said that counting blessings was a part of being grateful.\u2019\u201d Qatadah \uf072 (d. 118AH) said, \u201cSpreading good news of a blessing is part of being grateful for it.\u201d Al-Fudayl Ibn \u2018Iyad \uf072 (d. 187AH) said, \u201cIt used to be said that talking about a blessing was part of being grateful for it.\u201d Al-Hasan Ibn \u2018Ali \uf06b said, \u201cIf you  acquire  good,  then  tell  your  brothers.\u201d  Abu  Nadrah \uf072 (d. 108AH) said, \u201cThe Muslims used to consider that speaking about a blessing was part of being grateful for it.\u201d Ibn Abil-Hawari \uf072 said, \u201cAl-Fudayl Ibn \u2018Iyad and Sufy\u0101n Ibn  \u2018Uyaynah  (d.  199AH)  sat  one  night  until  morning mentioning their blessings. Sufyan kept saying, \u2018Allah has blessed us in such-and-such. Allah has blessed us in suchand-such. He has done such-and-such for us. He has done such-and-such for us.\u2019\u201d\nIt was reported that the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever does not show gratitude for what is little, has not shown gratitude for what is much. And whoever does not thank the people, has not thanked Allah. Mentioning Allah\u2019s blessing is a part of gratefulness, and to abandon doing so is from ungratefulness.  The  Jama\u2019ah  is  a  mercy,  and  discord  is  a torment,\u201d and, \u201cWhoever is granted a blessing and makes mention of it has shown gratitude for it. If he conceals it, then he is ungrateful for it,\u201d and, \u201cWhoever is given a gift and finds something he can give, then let him give it as a reward. If he cannot find anything to give, then let him praise the giver, for whoever praises him has shown gratitude for the gift and whoever conceals it is ungrateful for it.\u201d\nAllahu akbar! How much does the muwahhid mujahid have to show of gratitude towards his Lord for having blessed  him  with  Islam  and  the  Jama\u2019ah!  If  not  for  Allah,  he would be worshiping the tawaghit of the palaces and graveyards. If not for Allah, he would be following the scholars of the tawaghit and the du\u2019at of the Jahmiyyah. If not for Allah, he would be an effeminate \u201cmale\u201d having no protective jealousy for his Muslim sisters, a \u201cmale\u201d sitting back along with those who have remained behind from jihad. If not for Allah, he would be residing in Dar al-Kufr among the apostate policemen, judges, informants, spies, soldiers, and other murtaddin, or among the Jews, the Christians, the Magians, the atheists, and other kuffar. And if not for Allah, he would be from among the bughat (armed rebels), or the Khawarij, or other groups of discord, bid\u2019ah, and deviance.So praise be to Allah, who guided him to this, and he would never have been guided if Allah had not guided him.How difficult was the subjugation, the fitnah, and the affliction on the muwahhid mujahid before the blessing of the Jama\u2019ah! There were no schools in which his children \ncould study, no scholars from whom he could seek knowledge, no courts where he could litigate \u2013 for he is a muwahhid, rejecting the taghut courts \u2013 no dwellings in which he could live in peace and security, no lands in which he could seek refuge from the tawaghit, and no camps where he could train for war except in caves, jungles, or deserts, far from the obligation of the Jama\u2019ah as understood by the Salaf, which is the Khilafah.\nIf he were to manifest the Millah of Ibrahim back then among the kafirin and the murtaddin and call to it or strive to make preparations and wage jihad in order to terrorize the enemy, he would go to sleep not knowing if he would awaken in his home with his family or in a dark, underground  dungeon.\nThis  is  how  his  life  was,  and  then  Allah  blessed  him with the Jama\u2019ah, and all praise is due to Allah with whose blessing all good things are achieved. \u201cAnd remember when you were few and oppressed in the land, fearing that people might  abduct  you,  but  He  sheltered  you,  supported  you with His victory, and provided you with good things \u2013 that you might be grateful\u201d (Al-Anfal 26).\nThis blessing that he currently enjoys necessitates that he be grateful, both outwardly and inwardly, privately and publicly,  among  associates  and  strangers.  He  should  not leave his family without reminding them of it, nor his companions without mentioning it, nor the common people without spreading its virtues among them. He should praise Allah, who decreed this blessing for him and bestowed it upon him, and exalt Him for it, for there is no power or might except by Allah, al-Hayy al-Qayyum. The muwahhid mujahid then should make du\u2019a for the forerunners among the leaders and soldiers \u2013 particularly the shuhada among them \u2013 such as Shaykh Abu Mus\u2019ab az-Zarqawi, Shaykh Abu  Hamzah  al-Muhajir,  Shaykh  Abu  \u2018Umar  al-Baghdadi, Shaykh Abu Bakr al-\u2018Iraqi, Shaykh Abu \u2018Abdir-Rahman al-Bilawi,  Shaykh  Abul-Mu\u2019tazz  al-Qurashi,  Shaykh  Abu \u2018Ali  al-Anbari,  Shaykh  \u2018Umar  ash-Shishani,  and  Shaykh Abu Muhammad al-\u2018Adnani \u2013 may Allah accept them all. We consider them so \u2013 and Allah is their judge \u2013 and we do not place anyone above Allah\u2019s judgment. And whoever has not thanked the people has not thanked Allah.\nRather, if a man were to stay up all night as the two imams, al-Fudayl and Sufyan had done \u2013 counting what Allah has blessed him with through the Khilafah and its impact \u2013 it would still be little. \u201cAnd if you were to count the favors of Allah, you would not enumerate them. Indeed, mankind is most unjust and ungrateful\u201d (Ibrahim 34).\nAnd from the blessings of Allah upon the muwahhid mujahid is that He made him live until this era, until Allah revived the Khilafah through his jihad and made him from  among  those  who  defend  it,  guarding  its  frontiers. Abul-\u2018Abbas Ibn Taymiyyah \uf072 said, \u201cAnd know \u2013 may Allah rectify you \u2013 that of the greatest blessings upon the one whom Allah wants good for is that He made him live until this era in which Allah revives the religion, the honor of the Muslims, and the standing of the believers and mujahidin, such that he resembles the first forerunners of the Muhajirin and the Ansar. Thus, whoever carries such out in this era will be from among those who followed them in righteousness, those whom Allah is pleased with and who are \n\f", "schema:headline": "Just Terror Tactics", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "11"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah6-Wala-and-Bara,-O-Women", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "6", "schema:articleBody": "There\u2019s no doubt that with the return of the Khilafah, the establishment of the Islamic State, and the revival of the laws of the Shari\u2019ah that were abandoned and the rulings that were concealed, the minds of many women became enlightened and were illuminated by our noble shari\u2019ah.

Wala and bara are two of the principles of Islam according to ijma\u2019 (consensus), and they are from the testimony of \u201cLa ilaha illallah.\u201d A Muslim is not called a Muslim until he disavows kufr and its people, even if they are his closest relatives.\nA woman may say, \u201cBut my wala is to Allah, His Messenger,  and  the  believers,  and  the  greatest  evidence  of  that  is  that  I  live  in  Dar  al-Islam  and  enjoy the blessing of the shari\u2019ah of mankind\u2019s Lord!\u201d So know that having wala for the kuffar is not only through  aiding  them  and  supporting  them  against the Muslims. Rather, simply harboring love and affection for them and approving of them are examples of wala. Concerning love and affection, their place is in the heart, and the heart is the master and shepherd of the limbs. Imam Ahmad reported in his musnad that al-Bara Ibn \u2018Azib \uf068 said, \u201cWe were sitting with the Prophet g when he asked, \u2018Which bond of Islam \nis the strongest?\u2019 They said, \u2018The prayer.\u2019 He said, \u2018It is good, but it is not it.\u2019 They said, \u2018The zakah.\u2019 He said, \u2018It is good, but it is not it.\u2019 They said, \u2018Fasting Ramadan.\u2019 He said, \u2018It is good, but it is not it.\u2019 They said, \u2018The hajj.\u2019 He said, \u2018It is good, but it is not it.\u2019 They said, \u2018Jihad.\u2019 He said, \u2018It is good, but it is not it. Indeed, the strongest bond of Islam is to love for the sake of Allah and hate for the sake of Allah.\u2019\u201d\nSulayman  Al  ash-Shaykh  \uf072  said,  \u201cSo,  can  the religion be complete or the banner of jihad and the banner of commanding good and forbidding evil be raised  except  through  loving  for  the  sake  of  Allah, hating  for  the  sake  of  Allah,  having  enmity  for  the sake of Allah, and allying for the sake of Allah? And if the people were to agree on a single path and on mutual love with no enmity or hatred, there would be no means of dividing between truth and falsehood, nor between the believers and the kuffar, nor between the  allies  of  ar-Rahman  and  the  allies  of  Shaytan\u201d (Ad-Durar  as-Saniyyah).\nThere Has Emerged Between Us and You Enmity \nand Hatred\nThere is no wala without bara. Yes, you live amongst the muwahhidin and your wala is to Allah, His Messenger, and the believers, but do you disavow yourself of the enemies of Allah and the religion?\nPerhaps on the list of contacts in your phone there is someone from among your family, relatives, or friends who curses the Islamic State and openly declares their enmity towards its leaders, and perhaps some of your conversations with your relatives contain enmity and hatred for the Khilafah and its soldiers of which Allah is aware, but you\u2019re neither worried nor concerned \nSisters\n\fThe mujahid, Abu Hassan al-\u2018Iraqi \uf08a\nBaghdad Wilayah\nOn the 3rd of Rabi\u2019 al-Akhir, the istishhadi Abu Hassan  al-\u2018Iraqi  \uf08a  carried  out  an  attack  targeting Rafidi  murtaddin  in  Sadr  City  towards  the  east  of Baghdad in revenge for the Rafidi-Crusader coalition\u2019s repeated  targeting  of  health  institutions  in  Ninawa Wilayah. He set out and detonated his explosive vehicle on their dens, killing and injuring approximately 150 murtaddin.

A second istishhadi attack was carried out by Abu Dujanah al\u2018Iraqi \uf08a, who entered into the midst of another group of  Rafidah  and  detonated  his  explosive  vest,  killing and injuring approximately 45 of them.\nOn the 11th of Rabi\u2019 al-Akhir, following close surveillance of the dens and gatherings of the Rafidi army and  Rafidi  Mobilization\u2019s  officers  and  leaders  inside Al-Kindy College of Medicine in the area of Nahdah towards  the  east  of  Baghdad  and  Dijlah  University College in the area of Dawrah towards the south of Baghdad,  Islamic  State  explosive  units  parked  and detonated two car bombs on their gatherings, leading to 70 of them being killed and wounded.\nSalahuddin Wilayah\nOn the 3rd of Rabi\u2019 al-Akhir, a number of Islamic State inghimasiyyin launched an attack on Rafidi army positions in the city of Samarra.

Rather, in the darkness of night they straddled the  light  of  truth  and  kindled  with  their  blood  the torch  of  guidance,  while  shunning  the  paths  of deviance. From the book of their Lord they nourished themselves and upon the Sunnah of their Prophet g did they proceed and work. They knew that victory is indeed from Allah and that it was never for a moment due  to  the  magnitude  of  manpower  or  equipment. For indeed Allah is Mighty and none can overpower Him. Indeed He is the Compeller who forsakes him who has climaxed in strength and manpower. He is wise  as  He  decrees  affairs,  with  all  their  means,  as He  puts  things  in  their  rightful  places.  He  is  wise in His administering and granting victory to whom He grants victory, and in abandoning whomever He abandons of His slaves. Neither weakness nor defect can penetrate His administration.

Their results continue to contradict their principles, so they are left with no choice but to support their crumbling principles with even more falsehood, which only increases them in misguidance and increases their structure in ruin, until eventually nothing of Islam remains  therein.\nAs we discuss the methods of establishing the Islamic state, between those who follow the prophetic method and those who follow the paths of deviance, we find ourselves compelled to take a long look at the Twelver Rafidi experiment. This experiment brought them \u2013 through their own words and deeds \u2013 to fabricate a new religion that has no connection to Islam, except as much as the religions of the Jews and Christians have a connection to the religion of Ibrahim \uf06e. In studying this experiment, which spread over eleven centuries, we see that it is one of the longest of experiments and the clearest in showing the extent of deviance caused by its being built on a corrupt principle in working to establish the Islamic state. Their deceitful claim of striving to safeguard Islam of heresies and deviations is thus laid bare.\nThe Onset of Their Call\u2026 A Fabricated Appoint-\nment of Leadership\nThe  Rafidi  mushrikin  claim  that  the  beginning of  their  call  came  in  the  lifetime  of  the  Prophet  g through his nass (verbatim appointment) of \u2018Ali Ibn Abi Talib \uf068 and his descendants after him as khulafa and imams. But they have no evidence of this nass, other  than  what  they  have  fabricated  of  false  interpretations of texts from the Book and the Sunnah. In fact, the established evidences negate what they claim, like the saying of \u2018Umar \uf068, \u201cIf I were to not appoint a successor, then indeed Allah\u2019s Messenger g did not appoint a successor. And if I were to appoint a successor, then indeed Abu Bakr appointed a successor\u201d (Reported by Muslim). This shows that the Prophet g did not appoint \u2018Ali or any of the Sahabah \uf06a as his  successor.\nAlso, al-Aswad said, \u201cIt was mentioned in front of \u2018Aishah that \u2018Ali \uf06b was an heir (to authority), so she said, \u2018When did [the Prophet] appoint him? For indeed I was holding him to my chest when he called for a washbowl and then his body drooped and I did not realize that he had died. So when did he appoint him?\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim). Like-\nwise,  the  Sahabah  had  consensus  upon  giving  the bay\u2019ah (pledge of allegiance) to Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar, and \u2018Uthman \uf06a \u2013 and included in that consensus was \u2018Ali Ibn Abi Talib and his sons, al-Hasan and al-Husayn \uf06a. There are many other evidences, like these, that destroy this lie of the Rafidah.\nSomething else that invalidates this supposed nass is  the  dispute  among  the  Rafidah  and  others  who claim to support Ahl al-Bayt, as each of them says the authority  should  go  to  someone  different,  and  specifically after \u2018Ali \uf068 was killed. There are those who said it belonged to the descendants of al-\u2018Abbas Ibn \u2018Abdil-Muttalib. Others said it belonged to al-Hasan Ibn \u2018Ali or al-Husayn Ibn \u2018Ali or Muhammad Ibn \u2018Ali (Ibnul-Hanafiyyah)  \uf06a.  And  others  even  claimed  it for the sons of Ja\u2019far Ibn Abi Talib \uf068. Whenever any of the above would die, those who held these beliefs would fall further into misguidance by following such doubtful matters. If only they actually had a supported nass, the truth of their imam would be established. But too often they found nothing with which to uphold their claim over that of their opponents, other than  made  up  miracles  and  fallacious  phenomena, just as the Rafidah declared the imamah of \u2018Ali Ibn al-Husayn (known as as-Sajjad) \u2013 while rejecting the imamah of his uncle Muhammad Ibn al-Hanafiyyah \u2013 due to the former\u2019s bay\u2019ah supposedly being verbally declared by stones and trees!\nThe Source of Deviance of the Rafidah\u2026 Claim-\ning Infallibility for the Imams\nWe are able to summarize the main principle upon which  the  religion  of  the  Rafidah  has  stood,  and  it is that upon which all of their misguidances and deviances are built until this very day. It is their belief that  the  Islamic  state  cannot  be  established  without an imam who fulfills their conditions, for which Allah gave no authority. The most important of these conditions is that he be infallible: untouched by any defect whether apparent or hidden, knowledgeable of everything, including the unseen, and verified by the command of Allah c Himself.

Whoever accepted was encompassed with this mercy, and whoever opposed it and resisted was fought and dealt with using severe brutality until this enemy submitted to the command of Allah.  The  Prophet\u2019s  Sirah  contains  the  best  evidence of this.\nFollowing  the  Prophet\u2019s  return  from  Badr,  he  ordered that the prisoner \u2018Uqbah Ibn Abi Mu\u2019it be killed in  captivity,  and  this  was  because  \u2018Uqbah  had  been among  the  harshest  of  the  people  in  harming  Islam and the Muslims. Adh-Dhahabi said in the sirah he authored, \u201cThe Prophet \uf067 killed \u2018Uqbah Ibn Abi Mu\u2019it in [the valley of] \u2018Irq adh-Dhubyah. When the Prophet \uf067 ordered that he be killed, \u2018Uqbah said, \u2018Who will look after my sons, O Muhammad?\u2019 He said, \u2018Hellfire.\u2019 \u2018Asim Ibn Thabit Ibn Abil-Aqlah then killed him, and it was said that \u2018Ali \uf068 killed him.\u201d\nIn the Battle of Uhud, Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 ordered that the prisoner Abu \u2018Azzah al-Jumahi be killed, and he was a man who had daughters. Ibn Kathir said, \u201cNo mushrik  was  taken  prisoner  except  Abu  \u2018Azzah  al-Jumahi, who was also among the prisoners on the day of Badr. The Prophet \uf067 freed him without ransom [after Badr], and placed a condition on him that he not return to fighting him \uf067. When he was taken prisoner on the day of Uhud, Abu \u2018Azzah said, \u2018O Muhammad, free me for the sake of my daughters and I promise not to fight you.\u2019 So Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said to him, \u2018I will not let you walk around in Makkah saying, \u2018I deceived Mu-\n22Article\nhammad twice.\u2019\u2019 He then gave the order and his neck was struck. Some scholars have mentioned that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said that day, \u2018The believer is not stung from the same hole twice!\u2019\u201d (Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah).These two prisoners were not in a position warranting that they be freed, ransomed, or shown mercy, for if this were to have occurred it would have had a negative effect on the Prophet\u2019s reputation, as he \uf067 made clear when he killed Abu \u2018Azzah.\nAlso,  the  Prophet  \uf067  would  not  leave  one  who harmed Islam and the Muslims safe within the confines of his home, even if his harm was through mere speech and incitement, as was the case with the Jew, Ka\u2019b Ibn al-Ashraf.  Ibn  Ishaq  said,  \u201cHe  incited  against  Allah\u2019s Messenger  \uf067,  recited  abusive  poetry,  and  lamented those  of  Quraysh  thrown  into  the  well  at  Badr.  Ka\u2019b Ibn al-Ashraf then returned to Madinah and composed harassing poetry directed against Umm al-Fadl Bint alHarith and later against other women of the Muslims\u201d (Sirat Ibn Ishaq).\nAt this point, the order was issued from Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 to eliminate this taghut; he then asked who was prepared to carry out the operation. Jabir Ibn \u2018Abdillah \uf068 narrates, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u2018Who will deal with Ka\u2019b Ibn al-Ashraf, for indeed he has harmed Allah and His Messenger?\u2019 Muhammad Ibn Maslamah stood up and said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, would you like me to kill him?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes\u2019\u201d (Reported by alBukhari and Muslim).\nLater, following the Battle of al-Ahzab, Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 headed for Bani Quraydhah in order to besiege them, as recompense for their breaking of their treaty with the Prophet \uf067. Allah\u2019s judgment concern-\nArticle\ftained through abundance and pleasure in the dunya, while not being afflicted by hardship? Rather, it is attained by being killed beneath the shades of swords. \u201cOr did you think that you would enter Jannah and what came to those before you has yet to come to you \u2013 they were afflicted by hardship and distress, and they were shaken until the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, \u2018When will the support of Allah come?\u2019\u201d (Al-Baqarah 214). At-Tabari \uf072 said, \u201cThe meaning of these words is: Or do you think that you, O believers in Allah and His Messengers, shall enter into Jannah before you are afflicted as those before you were tested and tried with hardship \u2013 i.e. difficulty and poverty \u2013 and distress \u2013 i.e. illness and disease, and before you are shaken as they were shaken, meaning due to what their enemies brought to them of fear and terror, until the people consider Allah\u2019s support to be slow in coming to them, so they say, \u2018When will Allah support us?\u2019\u201d\nThis  was  not  unknown  to  Hiraql,  the  Roman  king, when he said to Abu Sufyan, \u201cI had asked you how your war with him carries on, and you claimed that sometimes you win the battles, and other times, he does. Such is the condition of the messengers, as they are tested and the ultimate victory is theirs\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim). How could this be unknown to the muwahhidin who think well of Allah?!\nAnd verily this religion is dear, and calling to tawhid and raising the word of Allah in the land requires enormous sacrifice, just like what was offered by the People of the Trench, whom the taghut of their time completely eradicated, leaving no person of them alive. And they \u2013 after believing in the Lord of the boy \u2013 watched as the kuffar dug the trenches and lit fires therein, in order to cast into them those who were steadfast and would not apostatize. But that did not even scratch at the surface of their iman, nor did it budge them from their religion, until even a woman came holding her baby boy while she was hesitating to throw herself into the fire, so her child said to her in encouragement, \u201cDear mother, have patience, for you are upon the truth\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Suhayb).\nAl-Bukhari  wrote,  \u201cChapter:  Those  Who  Choose  to Be  Struck,  Killed,  and  Humiliated  Rather  than  [Be  Coerced into Saying or Doing] Kufr.\u201d He mentioned therein the following narration of Khabbab Ibn al-Aratt \uf068, \u201cWe complained to Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 while he was reclining against his folded cloak in the shade of the Ka\u2019bah. We said to him, \u2018Will you not seek support for us? Will you not supplicate Allah for us?\u2019 He said, \u2018There were men before you who were put in holes, dug in the ground. Then saws were brought  to  them  and  placed  atop  their  heads,  until  they were split into two, but that did not turn them back from their religion. Their skins were combed with iron combs, separating their flesh from their bones or nerves, but that did not turn them back from their religion. By Allah! This matter will come to completion, until the rider from Sana\u2019a will travel to Hadramawt, fearing none but Allah or a wolf for his flock. But you seek to hasten matters.\u2019\u201d\nFor the struggle between truth and falsehood, there is a price that the believers must pay, as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cSo they kill and are killed\u201d (At-Tawbah 111). And what is greater than the Battle of Uhud as an excellent study and lesson \nlearned? In that battle, it was not a single wazir, amir, or leader, nor only two, three, or ten who were killed. Rather, it was the Sayyid of Shuhada, Hamzah, the uncle of the Prophet \uf067, among seventy of the best of the Sahabah \uf06a. In one day, this number of men were killed and mutilated. But which men? They were the Companions of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067. And on the Day of Uhud, the voice of kufr arose and the kuffar became inflated with pride. The kuffar thought their feat would last forever. Abu Sufyan stood and said, \u201cIs Muhammad there?\u201d He \uf067 said, \u201cDo not answer him.\u201d So he said, \u201cIs Ibn Abi Quhafah [Abu Bakr as-Siddiq] there?\u201d He \uf067 said, \u201cDo not answer him.\u201d So he said, \u201cIs [\u2018Umar] Ibnul-Khattab there?\u201d When no one answered, Abu Sufyan said, \u201cIndeed they have been killed, for if they were alive, they would have responded!\u201d But \u2018Umar was not able to contain himself, so he said, \u201cYou have lied, O enemy of Allah! Allah has kept for you what shall disgrace you!\u201d Abu Sufyan said, \u201cHubal [an idol] is highest!\u201d So the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cAnswer him.\u201d They said, \u201cWhat should we say?\u201d He said, \u201cSay, Allah is higher and more majestic!\u201d Abu Sufyan said, \u201cWe have \u2018Uzza, and there is no \u2018Uzza for you!\u201d So the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cAnswer him.\u201d They said, \u201cWhat should we say?\u201d He said, \u201cSay, Allah is our patron, and there is no patron for you!\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from al-Bara Ibn \u2018Azib).\nAn Arab poet once said, \u201cIf a chief of ours departs, another chief stands, speaking and acting as nobles do. And our days are known to our enemy, as they are crowned and adorned in glory.\u201d\nAre  the  believers  today  better  to  Allah  than  that  first generation of men, those who were tested and shaken greatly  until  their  hearts  reached  their  throats?!  And  whoever thinks that the conquests of Rome and Constantinople will be made through empty words \u2013 not wounds \u2013 is confused and mistaken!1\nIt should be clear then that after the trials and tribulations, the believing muwahhid stands solid, by his Lord\u2019s permission, and that the munafiq and anyone with weak iman will fall. Thereafter, only the pure will remain. These are those whose cores have been cleansed and clarified of any impurities and filth of the dunya. Then, at that time only, the voice of truth will rise in their souls, and the answer will come to them, descending upon them in all its coolness and tranquility. \u201cO! Verily the victory of Allah is near\u201d (Al-Baqarah 214). Indeed such victory and conquest is near, as we find the wind of our blessed Khilafah blowing from east to west, despite the claims of the enemy. Thus, patience is most fitting, and Allah\u2019s aid alone is sought.\n1   The conquest of Constantinople comes after very many martyrs and wounds, as in the events leading up to it, one third of the Muslim army  is  killed  in  the  Malhamah  against  the  Crusaders  who  encamp in Dabiq. The triumphant survivors thereafter advance through their jihad until they reach Constantinople and lay siege to it. Only then, after much blood and sweat, does the takbir and tahlil of the patient and persevering muwahhid mujahidin cause the defenses of the city to collapse. This blessing and bounty from Allah through takbir and tahlil is the reward for sincere intentions and serious actions, not the lack thereof found in the empty words of the hypocrites and the sickhearted. \n\f", "schema:headline": "Brutality and Severity towards the Kuffar", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "21"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah6-Military-and-Covert-Operations", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "6", "schema:articleBody": "As the soldiers of the Khilafah continue waging war on the forces of kufr, we take a glimpse at a number of recent operations conducted by the mujahidin of the Islamic State that have succeeded in expanding the territory of the Khilafah, or terrorizing, massacring, and humiliating the enemies of Allah.

They  succeeded  in  killing  several  murtaddin  and  in injuring a number of others.\nNews\n\fsecond is that you must steady your hearts and mention Him with your tongues, for the heart does not settle during the conflict and the tongue may be jumbled. So He ordered remembrance until the heart is firm with certainty and the tongue is firm with dhikr, saying what the companions of Talut said, \u2018Our Lord! Pour upon us patience and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people\u2019 (Al-Baqarah  250).  This  condition  cannot  be  accomplished except  through  the  strength  of  knowledge  and  the ignition of insight, which is the commendable courage of men. The third is that you must remember the promise Allah made to you when you sold your souls, as well as the reward He has for you.\u201d\nI say that all of these opinions should be considered,  as  one  should  mention  Allah  with  his  tongue while  his  heart  feels  bold,  remembering  what  Allah promised him of support in the Dunya and gardens in the Akhirah. And Allah c said to Musa and Harun, \u201cDo not slacken in My remembrance\u201d (Ta Ha 42).  Ibn  Kathir  \uf072  said,  \u201cThis  means  they  were  to not languish in the remembrance of Allah when they faced Fir\u2019awn, that Allah\u2019s dhikr would support and empower them, as well as being a decisive authority against  [Fir\u2019awn].\u201d\nKnow  that  the  dhikr  of  Allah  during  combat  is something secret. Al-Hakim authenticated the report from Abu Musa \uf068 that Allah\u2019s Messenger g would dislike raised voices during combat.1\nThe eighth path to victory is du\u2019a (supplication). Allah c said, \u201cSay, \u2018My Lord would not care for you if  not  for  your  supplication\u2019\u201d  (Al-Furqan  77),  and, \u201cSo call upon Him, being sincere to Him in religion\u201d (Ghafir 65), and, \u201cInvoke Him in fear and aspiration. Indeed,  the  mercy  of  Allah  is  near  to  the  doers  of good\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 56), and \u201cYour Lord says, \u2018Call upon Me; I will respond to you.\u2019 Indeed, those who disdain My worship will loathingly enter Jahannam\u201d (Ghafir 60), and, \u201cWhen My servants ask you concerning Me, then indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond  to  Me  [with  obedience]  and  believe  in  Me that they may be rightly guided\u201d (Al-Baqarah 186).Allah\u2019s Messenger g said, \u201cDu\u2019a is \u2018ibadah (worship)\u201d  (Reported  by  Ibn  Majah,  Abu  Dawud,  and \n1  The author\u2019s use of this hadith does not negate the raising of one\u2019s voice with dhikr during battles. Rather, the Prophet\u2019s g dislike of raised voices during combat means at the moment of contact with the enemy: in his time, when swords clashed, and in our time, when triggers are pulled. And Allah knows best.\nat-Tirmidhi from an-Nu\u2019man Ibn Bashir). Al-Hakim and others reported from Abu Hurayrah \uf068, that he g said, \u201cNothing is more precious to Allah than du\u2019a\u201d (Al-Mustadrak). He also said, \u201cWhoever does not ask of Allah, He is angry with him\u201d (Reported by at-Tirmidhi from Abu Hurayrah). Ibn Taymiyyah \uf072 said, \u201cVictory and provision are obtained through various means. The most sure of them is the du\u2019a of the believers.\u201d He also said, \u201cWhen victory was determined on the Day of Badr, and the Prophet g told his companions that it would come and that the enemy would fall, what led to that was the Prophet g seeking help and making du\u2019a\u201d (Majmu\u2019 al-Fatawa).\nThis is Allah\u2019s Messenger g who, when he saw the multitudes  of  his  enemy  and  their  strength,  as  well as the scarcity of his companions and their weakness, resorted  to  the  only  one  in  whose  Hand  victory  is held. \u201cVictory is not except from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 126). \u2018Umar Ibn al-Khattab \uf068 said, \u201cOn the Day of Badr, Allah\u2019s Messenger g looked at the mushrikin, who were one-thousand, and  at  his  companions,  while  his  companions  were three-hundred nineteen men. So the Prophet of Allah g faced the qiblah, then spread out his hands and began calling out to his Lord, \u2018O Allah, fulfill what You promised me. O Allah, give me what You promised me. O Allah, if You destroy this small group of Muslims, You will not be worshiped on the earth.\u2019 He would not stop calling out to his Lord with his hands extended, facing the qiblah, until his cloak fell from his shoulders\u201d (Reported by Muslim).\nHe  g  would  make  du\u2019a  against  the  mushrikin in  general,  saying,  \u201cO  Allah,  Revealer  of  the  Book, Swift  in  Judgment;  O  Allah,  defeat  the  factions;  O Allah, defeat them and shake their foundations\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from \u2018Abdillah Ibn Abi Awfa). He would also specifically mention their individuals  and  chiefs,  as  Ibn  Mas\u2019ud  \uf068  narrated, saying, \u201cThe Prophet g faced the Ka\u2019bah and made du\u2019a against some members of Quraysh: against Shaybah  Ibn  Rabi\u2019ah,  \u2018Utbah  Ibn  Rabi\u2019ah,  al-Walid  Ibn \u2018Utbah,  and  Abu  Jahl  Ibn  Hisham.  I  bear  witness, by Allah, that I saw each of them knocked dead on the ground, mutilated by the sun\u201d (Reported by alBukhari  and  Muslim).\nKnow, O ally of Allah, that you are in one of the places where the du\u2019a is answered. Sahl Ibn Sa\u2019d asSa\u2019di said, \u201cThere are two hours for which the doors of  the  heavens  are  opened,  and  in  which  scarcely  a supplicant\u2019s du\u2019a goes unanswered: when the call to \n\f", "schema:headline": "Military and Covert Operations", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "25"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah12", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah12-A-Mujahid's-Memories-from-the-Battle-of-Mosul", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "12", "schema:articleBody": "10ARTICLEARTICLE\n\fAll praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the creation. May blessings and peace be upon the seal of the prophets and messengers, Muhammad, and upon his family and all his companions. As for what follows:\nIn  this  article  we  will  discuss  the  ruling  of  giving da\u2019wah to the asli kuffar (i.e. those who are disbelievers in origin, as opposed to those who became disbelievers after previously being Muslims) prior to fighting them. We will also discuss the ruling of giving da\u2019wah both to those whom the da\u2019wah has already reached and those whom it has not yet reached, prior to fighting them. We likewise discuss the evidences for these issues, as well as the evidence for initiating battle without giving da\u2019wah to those who have already heard of the religion of Islam. We will also clarify the ruling on killing the kuffar whom the da\u2019wah has not yet reached, and also clarify whether or not these rulings apply to the murtaddin.\nRulings Related to Giving Da\u2019wah to the Harbi \n(Belligerent) Kuffar\nWhat is meant by the harbi kuffar is the kuffar to whom the Muslims have not granted security through either a covenant of security, a ceasefire agreement, or a dhimmah contract. And what is meant by giving them da\u2019wah is to call them firstly to Islam, and if they refuse, to call them to pay the jizyah, prior to fighting them. The fuqaha have stated that da\u2019wah with them is of two types: \u201chaqiqi\u201d da\u2019wah, and \u201chukmi\u201d da\u2019wah. As for \u201chaqiqi\u201d da\u2019wah,  it  is  da\u2019wah  which  is  given  by  way  of  speech before fighting begins, and as for \u201chukmi\u201d da\u2019wah, it is that the da\u2019wah spreads, becomes manifest, reaches the harbi kuffar, and as a result, takes the place of haqiqi da\u2019wah.\nHaqiqi Da\u2019wah\nThe description of haqiqi da\u2019wah is that the Muslim leader calls the kuffar to Islam when he descends in their territory. Al-Qayrawani al-Maliki said, \u201cAnd it is more beloved to us that the enemy not be fought until he is called to Allah\u2019s religion, unless they hasten to fight us. So  either  they  embrace  Islam  or  pay  jizyah,  otherwise they are fought. And jizyah is only accepted from them if they are in a place where our authority can reach them. If, however, they are far away from us, jizyah is not accepted from them unless they move to our lands, otherwise they are fought\u201d (Ar-Risalah by al-Qayrawani).\nThey are first called to Islam, and their embracing of Islam is by merely pronouncing the shahadatayn (the \ntwo testimonies of faith) without having to carry out the laws, because carrying out the laws of Islam is impossible at the point of battle. So it is obligatory on them to enter Islam in that situation, and this is achieved with the pillar of the shahadatayn.\nImam Malik said, \u201cWhen da\u2019wah becomes obligatory, they are only called to Islam in a general sense without mentioning the laws, unless they ask about them, in which case they should be clarified to them. Likewise, they are called to jizyah in a general sense without explaining the details  and  without  specifying  the  amount,  unless  the Muslims are asked about that, in which case it should be clarified for them (the kuffar)\u201d (At-Taj wal-Iklil).\nAs for the length of the period of da\u2019wah, some scholars said it is three continuous days, just as a murtadd is called on for three days to repent before being killed.\nHukmi Da\u2019wah\nHukmi da\u2019wah is achieved when the kuffar hear of the religion of Islam and what it calls to. Allah c said, \u201cAnd this Quran was revealed to me that I may warn you  thereby  and  whomever  it  reaches\u201d  (Al-An\u2019am  19). In  his  tafsir,  Imam  at-Tabari  narrates  from  Mujahid that he said, \u201c\u2018And this Quran was revealed to me that I may warn you thereby\u2019: \u2018The Arabs,\u2019 \u2018and whomever it reaches\u2019: \u2018The non-Arabs\u2019\u201d (Jami\u2019 al-Bayan fi Tawil alQuran).\nIbn  \u2018Abbas  said,  \u201c\u2018And  this  Quran  was  revealed  to me that I may warn you thereby\u2019, meaning: the people of Makkah, \u2018and whomever it reaches,\u2019 meaning: if this Quran reaches anyone it is a warner for them\u2019\u201d (Jami\u2019 alBayan by Imam at-Tabari).\nAbu Hurayrah narrated, that Allah\u2019s Messenger g said,  \u201cBy  Him  in  Whose  hand  is  Muhammad\u2019s  soul, no one from this ummah hears of me \u2013 neither Jew nor Christian \u2013 and then dies without having believed in that which I have been sent with except that he will be from among the people of Hellfire\u201d (Reported by Muslim).\nImam  Ibn  Taymiyyah  r  said,  \u201cIf  the  da\u2019wah  of Allah\u2019s Messenger  g  \u2013 the da\u2019wah to Allah\u2019s religion with which He sent him \u2013 reaches anyone and they do not respond to it, it is obligatory to fight them \u2018until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah\u2019\u201d (Majmu\u2019  al-Fatawa).\nThe scholars differed with regards to giving da\u2019wah to the kuffar before fighting them. Among them were those who stipulated that da\u2019wah be given in all cases before fighting, regardless of whether the da\u2019wah has reached them or has not, and this is the position of the majority \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "A Mujahid's Memories from the Battle of Mosul", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "9"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5-The-Siyahah-of-Jihad", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "5", "schema:articleBody": "Abu Dawud reported in his sunan from Abu Umamah al-Bahili \uf068 that a man said, \u201cO Messenger of Allah, permit me to practice siyahah.\u201d So the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cIndeed, the siyahah of my ummah is jihad for Allah\u2019s cause.\u201d Abu Dawud was silent concerning the authenticity of this hadith. Al-Hakim reported it in his mustadrak and declared its isnad sahih. \u2018Abdul-Haqq al-Ishbili and adh-Dhahabi declared the hadith sahih. And an-Nawawi and al-\u2018Iraqi declared its isnad jayyid (good).\nThis hadith is from among that which some people of hijrah and jihad have incorrectly understood, thinking that the siyahah of jihad means, as according to its modern usage, \u201ctravelling from country to country for the purpose of pleasure or sightseeing and discovery.\u201d1 Due to this misunderstanding, if one were to observe some aspect of beauty in the land to which he has made hijrah, such as mountains, rivers, beaches, and trees, or were to find some aspect of luxury in food, drink, dress, and shelter, he would point to that blossom of worldly life and say, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 spoke the truth. Indeed, jihad is the \u2018tourism\u2019 of the Ummah!\u201d\nThis is how many people have misunderstood the hadith and the athar, and what a big difference between what is intended in the noble hadith and what the minds of many people have understood!\nIf it were asked, \u201cWhat is the meaning of the \u2018siyahah\u2019 mentioned if it is not tourism?\u201d the answer would be that the uncommon Arabic words in hadith are to be interpreted according to the eloquent tongue of the Arabs and according to the understanding of the righteous Salaf \u2013 not according to the terminology coined by  the  later  generations,  nor  according  to  that  with  which  the people of the modern era are acquainted \u2013 and this is done by referring back to the imams specialized in the language and the uncommon Arabic words, who have preserved the meanings of the Quran and hadith for those generations after them just as the Quran reciters and the muhaddithin have preserved the words of the two revelations \u2013 may Allah reward them, on behalf of Islam and the Muslims, with tremendous good.\nIbn  Qutaybah  \uf072  (died  276AH)  stated  in  his  explanation of the term \u201csiyahah\u201d in the athar, \u201cSiyahah is to leave the cities \n1   This is the definition of siyahah in the contemporary Arabic dictionary \u201cAl-Mu\u2019jam al-Wasit.\u201d The word siyahah, in the context of the hadith, is often wrongly translated as \u201ctourism\u201d in English.\nand travel into the open land, like the action of\u2026the worshipers of Bani Israil\u2026 He \uf067 meant that Allah \uf062 forbade the Muslims from this and sent him with the religion of moderation and monotheism\u201d  (Gharib  al-Hadith). \nIbnul-Anbari \uf072 (died 328AH) said, \u201cSiyahah is to head to the outer reaches of the lands and to isolate oneself from the people, such that one attends neither Jumu\u2019ah nor congregational prayers\u201d (az-Zahir).\nAbu Mansur al-Azhari \uf072 (died 370AH) said, \u201cAl-Layth said, \u2018Siyahah is that a man travels throughout the land for worship and monasticism, and the siyahah of this ummah is fasting and regularly attending the masajid\u2019\u201d (Tahdhib al-Lughah).\nThus, the siyahah that the Prophet \uf067 did not permit is that of monasticism, which the Most Just of Judges had not legislated. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cThen We sent Our messengers following their [i.e. Nuh and Ibrahim\u2019s] footsteps and followed them with \u2018Isa, the son of Maryam, and gave him the Injil. And We placed in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy and monasticism, which they innovated; We did not prescribe it for them except [that they did so] seeking the approval of Allah. But they did not observe it duly. So We gave the ones who believed among them their reward, but many of them are defiantly disobedient\u201d (Al-Hadid 27).\n\u2018Urwah  Ibn  az-Zubayr \uf072  said,  \u201cThe  wife  of  \u2018Uthman  Ibn Madh\u2019un entered\u2026upon \u2018Aishah looking disheveled, so \u2018Aishah asked her, \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 She said, \u2018My husband prays all night and fasts all days.\u2019 Then, the Prophet \uf067 entered and \u2018Aishah mentioned that to him, so Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 met with \u2018Uthman and said, \u2018O \u2018Uthman, indeed monasticism has not been prescribed for us. Is there not an example in me for you? For by Allah, I am the most fearful of Allah among you and the one most observant of His limits\u2019\u201d (Reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, and Ibn Hibban).Likewise,  when  one  of  the  Sahabah  \uf06a  sought  permission from the Prophet \uf067 to practice siyahah, he \uf067 forbade him from imitating the deviant monks and guided him to what Allah \uf063 had legislated as a methodology for the best ummah brought forth for mankind, jihad for His cause, which contains what is found in the monastic siyahah of zuhd, reclusion, dhikr, and worship. And by adhering to these realities, the mujahid may come closer to Allah and thereby become from among the monks of the night and the \nArticle\fA  final  benefit  to  note  is  that  we  are  not  more courageous  than  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  \uf067,  who  would wear a coat of armor and a helmet, just as he had a sword. \u2018Aishah \uf069 said, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 passed away while his coat of armor was pawned to a Jew for thirty measures of barley\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari). It  is  also  established  that  the  Prophet  \uf067  wore  two coats of armor, one on top of the other, on the Day of Uhud (Reported by Ahmad and Abu Dawud from asSaib Ibn Yazid). Likewise, Anas Ibn Malik narrated that the Prophet \uf067 entered Makkah, the year it was conquered, and he was wearing a helmet on his head (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nMoreover, the Lord of might guided us to using metal ingots as the basis of producing the weapons of today. In the story of Dhul-Qarnayn, He \uf063 said, \u201c\u2018Bring  me  blocks  of  iron,\u2019  until,  when  he  leveled what  was  between  the  two  flanks,  he  said,  \u2018Blow,\u2019 until,  when  he  had  made  it  a  fire,  he  said,  \u2018Bring me  molten  copper  to  pour  over  it\u2019\u201d  (Al-Kahf  96). That, and it has been discovered recently that adding a  percentage  of  copper  to  iron  is  the  best  way  to harden the iron and increase its strength, resistance, and  solidity.\nAs for preparations related to media, then indeed the  battles  of  the  mujahidin  and  their  enemies revolve, today, around two important axes. The first is the military axis, which has already been mentioned. The  second  is  the  axis  of  confronting  the  Satanic media that has distorted the identity of the Ummah, perverted  its  \u2018aqidah  and  values,  and  propped  up the  pillars  of  humiliation  and  psychological  defeat. Indeed,  the  blazing  missiles  of  media  are  more lethal  and  more  dangerous  for  the  Ummah  and  its \nAlso,  Allah  taught  Nuh  how  to  construct  ships. He  said,  \u201cMake  the  ark  under  Our  eyes  and  with Our inspiration\u201d (Hud 37). At-Tabari reported from Ibn \u2018Abbas \uf06b that he said, \u201cHe did not know how to make the ark, so Allah inspired to him to make it  based  on  the  model  of  a  bird\u2019s  breast.\u201d  And  the Prophet \uf067 commended those soldiers of his ummah who rode ships, as is in the hadith of Umm Haram \uf069 (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim). So is there anyone  to  undertake  such  production?\nAllah \uf063 also said, \u201cAllah came at their building from  the  foundations,  so  the  roof  fell  upon  them from  above\u201d  (An-Nahl  26).  It  is  known  to  anyone who  understands  explosives  and  how  to  use  them that this verse contains the basis for demolition using explosives. \nFurthermore, no industry has been encouraged as much  as  the  manufacturing  of  war  tools,  as  it  was reported that the Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cThree people enter into Jannah due to a single arrow: The one who made it, hoping it will be used for good, the one who shoots it, and the one who passes it [to the shooter]\u201d (Reported by Ibn Majah, Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidhi, and  an-Nasai  from  \u2018Uqbah  Ibn  \u2018Amir).  How,  then, about one who manufactures a rocket or an aircraft or invents an explosive material?\nmen than the infernal missiles fired from warplanes. Accordingly, it is only appropriate that the mujahidin \u2013  those  whom  Allah  has  accommodated  with  the ability to break the force of their enemies militarily \u2013 also contend on another front: the media front.\nAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cWage jihad against the mushrikin with your tongues\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from Anas Ibn Malik). He \uf067 also said, \u201cIndeed, the believer wages jihad with his sword and his tongue. By the One in whose hand is my soul, it is as if you are shooting [with your words] a barrage of arrows\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from Ka\u2019b Ibn Malik). Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 would employ his era\u2019s most effective form of media, that which was harshest on the hearts of  his  enemies:  poetry.  At-Tirmidhi  and  an-Nasai reported from Anas Ibn Malik that the Prophet \uf067 entered  Makkah  for  \u2018Umrat  al-Qada  and  \u2018Abdullah Ibn Rawahah was walking in front of him, saying,\nO sons of infidels, leave alone His way,for we strike for His revelation today \u2013a strike that, heads from their napes, will split,making a beloved, his beloved, forget.\u2018Umar  then  said,  \u201cIbn  Rawahah!  You  would recite poetry in front of Allah\u2019s Messenger and at the Haram  of  Allah?!\u201d  So  the  Prophet  \uf067  said  to  him, \u201cLeave him alone, \u2018Umar, for [such words] pass more quickly  through  them  than  a  barrage  of  arrows.\u201d\nAnd  just  as  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  \uf067  rejoiced  when Khalid \u2013 the military leader \u2013 accepted Islam, he also rejoiced  when  one  of  the  greatests  poets  accepted Islam.  When  the  delegation  of  the  Ansar  came  for the  bay\u2019ah  of  \u2018Aqabah,  he  said  to  al-\u2018Abbas,  \u201cDo you  know  these  two  men?\u201d  When  he  turned,  he said, \u201cYes, this is al-Bara Ibn Ma\u2019rur, the chief of his people, and this is Ka\u2019b Ibn Malik.\u201d Ka\u2019b said, \u201cBy Allah, I will not forget the word of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067  when  he  asked,  \u2018The  poet?\u2019\u201d  Al-\u2018Abbas  replied, \u201cYes\u201d (Reported by Ahmad). It was also related that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 would prepare his poets well, as he said to Hassan Ibn Thabit, \u201cGo to Abu Bakr and have him teach you the faults of the people, for he is knowledgeable of lineages\u201d (Al-Bayhaqi: Lubab alAnsab). Hassan sought permission from the Prophet \uf067 to poetically insult the mushrikin [of Quraysh], to which he replied, \u201cHow about my lineage?\u201d Hassan said,  \u201cI  will  spare  you  from  them  just  as  a  hair  is pulled  out  from  dough\u201d  (Reported  by  al-Bukhari from  \u2018Aishah).  And  the  Prophet  \uf067  enjoyed  good poetry. He said, \u201cThe most truthful word spoken by a  poet  is  the  word  of  Labid,  \u2018Alas,  everything  save Allah  is  of  no  avail,\u2019  and  Umayyah  Ibn  Abis-Salt nearly entered into Islam\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and  Muslim  from  Abu  Hurayrah).\nLikewise,  he  \uf067  made  Thabit  Ibn  Qays  Ibn Shammas \u2013 one of those who were promised Jannah \u2013 a spokesman to speak out for Islam and the Muslims. So  when  Bani  Tamim  came  with  their  spokesman and  poet,  the  Prophet  \uf067  said  to  Thabit  Ibn  Qays, \u201cStand and reply to him.\u201d Thabit then responded. At that, al-Aqra\u2019 Ibn Habis said, \u201cIndeed, Muhammad is \n\f", "schema:headline": "The Siyahah of Jihad", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "19"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah10-Establishing-the-Islamic-State:-Part-4", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "In  the  last  part  of  this  series  of  articles,  we  provided a glimpse at the history and the origin of the religion of the Rafidah on the basis of the false theory of \u201cal-imamah al-ilahiyyah\u201d (the divine imamah), and the theories derived from it, such as \u201cwasiyyah\u201d (inherited authority), \u201cnass\u201d (verbatim appointment), \u201ctaqiyyah\u201d (concealing the truth out of fear), \u201cbada\u201d (occurrence  of  an  idea),  \u201cghaybah\u201d  (prolonged  absence), \u201craj\u2019ah\u201d (reincarnation), and other kufri innovations  and  superstitions.\nAnd we shall attempt in this series \u2013 by Allah\u2019s permission \u2013 to explain how the Rafidah were compelled to  play  with  the  theory  of  al-imamah  al-ilahiyyah, \nwhich they made a condition for the establishment of the Islamic State, and how they added modification after modification upon that until they arrived at the theory of \u201cwilayat al-faqih\u201d (the leadership of the jurist), which abrogated the foundations of their original theories, and which the shirki Iranian state is founded upon today, and which they seek to spread throughout all the Muslim lands.\nIn contrast to the claims of the Rafidah that their religion  is  revelation  from  the  heavens  upon  Allah\u2019s Messenger, Muhammad g, and that it reached them in stages by way of \u2018Ali Ibn Abi Talib \uf068 and his sons, and which they even wrote down on sheets of paper \n20ARTICLE\nARTICLE\fhaving tread the path of jihad and then turned back \u2013 call to deserting the mujahidin.

He was a devout worshiper who would pray at night and fast during the day, and who would recite the Quran,  memorize it, and  contemplate  it. These were his deeds and  his  habits  in his  daily  life  in  the land  of  jihad.  He would  likewise  be gracious in assisting the brothers, whether in the kitchen or elsewhere,  and  he would not forget to remember  Allah  at all  times.  This  was how  he  remained until  he  was  honored with shahadah. His  good  conduct and his kindness towards  the  Muslims made  him  beloved among the brothers, his severe enmity and rage towards  the  kuffar  led  to  him  being  pursued  by  his enemies, and the strength of his resolve and might terrorized the criminals of the taghut government in his  land.\nWhen he heard the call to jihad, he set out, responding to the call of Allah and His Messenger. He made hijrah to the Philippines in \u201c2006\u201d and joined the ranks of the mujahidin in the Abu Sayyaf Islamic movement \u2013 which, at the time, was under the leadership of Shaykh Khadaffy Janjalani \uf08a \u2013 with brothers from Indonesia and Malaysia. He waged jihad with them for a short period and then returned to his land and his place of birth in Sabah, carrying with him the manhaj of jihad and determined to open a jihad front there. However, Allah decreed that he would be detained and imprisoned by the taghut of Malaysia. He remained in prison for two years with patience and  steadfastness,  despite  the  plots  of  the  enemies, from among the scholars of evil who call to the gates of Hellfire and the abandonment of jihad and its illuminated path, and from among those who \u2013 after \nABU SABAH \uf08a JOINED THE MUJAHIDIN IN EAST ASIA WHO WOULD GO ON TO GIVE BAY\u2019AH TO THE KHILAFAH\none another to remain patient and steadfast, and he would always make du\u2019a for Allah to return him to the ranks of the mujahidin.\nIn the year \u201c2008,\u201d he came out of prison, and the taghut government of Malaysia continued to monitor him wherever he went, but he did not weaken and did not despair of joining the ranks of the mujahidin once again, and in the year \u201c2011\u201d Allah granted him the blessing of making hijrah once more to the Philippines. The taghut Malaysian government was enraged when it found out that he had reached the land of jihad in the Philippines, and it later joined the Crusader Filipino government in its war against the mujahidin there.

So Allah g clarified that it was the prophets  whom  He  commissioned  with the task of ruling with what He revealed, and  they  were  the  ones  who  would  lead \nBani Israil, as the Prophet g said, \u201cThe prophets would lead Bani Israil, and every time a prophet passed away, another prophet would succeed him. And indeed, there is no prophet after me. There will be khulafa and they will  be  many.\u201d  They  (i.e.  the  Sahabah)  said,  \u201cWhat  do you order us to do?\u201d He said \u201cFulfill your bay\u2019ah to the [one  given  bay\u2019ah]  first,  and  give  them  their  right,  for indeed  Allah  will  ask  them  about  that  which  He  has given  them  guardianship  over\u201d  (Reported  by  Muslim). So  the  khulafa  take  the  role  of  the  prophets  in  ruling the people with what Allah has revealed, and the pious scholars are their helpers in that regard.\nThe Rightly-Guided Khilafah Inherits the \nProphetic Methodology\nIndeed,  from  the  most  important  of  responsibilities of the Khilafah in this era is to renew the religion and establish it upon the prophetic methodology, as promised by  our  prophet g  in  his  statement,  \u201cProphethood  will remain  among  you  for  as  long  as  Allah  wills  for  it  to remain.  Then,  He  will  lift  it  when  He  wills  to  lift it.  Then,  there  will  be  khilafah  upon  the  prophetic methodology,  and  it  will  remain  for  as  long  as  Allah wills  for  it  to  remain.  Then,  He  will  lift  it  when  He wills to lift it. Then, there will be biting kingship, and it will remain for as long as Allah wills for it to remain. Then,  He  will  lift  it  when  He  wills  to  lift  it.  Then, there  will  be  oppressive  kingship,  and  it  will  remain for  as  long  as  Allah  wills  for  it  to  remain.  Then,  He will lift it when He wills to lift it. Then, there will be khilafah upon the prophetic methodology\u201d (Reported by Ahmad).  So  the  Khilafah  that  is  sought  is  that  which is  upon  the  prophetic  methodology,  and  the  Khilafah upon the prophetic methodology is that which achieves the  description  of  rushd  (right  guidance),  which  is  the description given to the Khilafah of the leading group of the companions of Allah\u2019s Messenger g.\nAnd a khilafah can only be described with rushd if \u2013 by Allah\u2019s permission \u2013 the khalifah follows the Book of Allah and the guidance of our prophet, Muhammad g, in all affairs and in all circumstances.\nRushd  has  various  meanings  in  the  Book  of  Allah g,  and  among  its  greatest  meanings  is  the  grace  and guidance  of  Allah g  for  those  of  His  slaves  whom  He loves:  \u201cAnd  know  that  among  you  is  the  Messenger  of Allah. If he were to obey you in much of the matter, you would  be  in  difficulty,  but  Allah  has  endeared  to  you the faith and has made it pleasing in your hearts and has made hateful to you disbelief, defiance and disobedience. \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Take Advantage of Your Spare Time before You Become Occupied", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "9"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3-Among-the-Believers-Are-Men:\rAbu-\u2018Abdillah-al-Britaini-\r", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "3", "schema:articleBody": "Abu \u2018Abdillah was a very sociable, lively, friendly, gentle person with a soft heart and a blessed smile. He was one of those characters whom everyone liked. He was never arrogant, regardless of whatever position he held. He was always humble towards others and would recognize his own mistakes and faults, and it was for this reason that he was dearly loved by many.Anyone who saw him could not help but to be reminded of wala and bara and see the love and concern he had for the religion and the Ummah. He was gentle towards the believers and harsh towards the kuffar, with his severity towards kufr and its people being a trait of his that was internationally known, due to his many efforts in giving global da\u2019wah, making him an inspiration for many Muslims around the world. The fact that he was active in da\u2019wah, however, didn\u2019t reduce him to being someone who just talked on and on  without  backing  up  his  words  with  deeds,  as  is the case with many du\u2019at nowadays. Rather, he was a man of action who not only \u201ctalked the talk,\u201d but also \u201cwalked the walk.\u201d\nHe  was  very  brave  hearted,  someone  who  stood firm and remained sincere in what he called for, not fearing the blame of critics. He had a strong determination and stubbornness in following the truth and was swift to sacrifice what he held dear, seeking Allah\u2019s contentment, spending both his wealth and his life for the sake of Allah \uf063.\nHe was born and raised in Britain, the youngest of five siblings. One can imagine the mischief and cor-\nExclusive\nruption a young man can fall into growing up in the lands of the Crusaders, where evil and corruption is widespread and where the ills of society are glamorized. It was the events of 9/11 that would inspire him to begin studying and practicing his religion. He then began preaching Islam to people, calling them to the tawhid of Allah \uf062, publically condemning the British government for the many  atrocities  committed  against  Muslims  both  locally  and abroad, and calling for the implementation of Allah\u2019s Shari\u2019ah and the revival of the Khilafah.1 Due to his da\u2019wah, he not only became well known in the community, but also became well known to the British authorities. Rather than deterring him or frightening him, however, this only spurred him on and made him more determined to call to the truth.\nThe Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cHe who possesses three characteristics has tasted the sweetness of iman: That Allah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than anything else, that he loves a person, only loving him for Allah\u2019s sake, and that he hates returning to \n1   This was prior to the Khilafah\u2019s eventual revival in the year 1435AH with the appointment of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi \uf085 as the Khalifah, an event that Abu \u2018Abdillah would witness as a soldier of the Islamic State. He thus not only called for the revival of the Khilafah, but translated his words into deeds by fighting to bring it back.\n\fand that He has no partner in legislation. The evidences for tawhid in rule and legislation are very numerous.\nThe  author  of  \u201cAdwa  al-Bayan\u201d  said,  \u201cCommitting shirk in Allah\u2019s rule is like committing shirk in His worship. Allah said concerning His rule, \u2018He does not have shirk in His rule with anyone\u2019 (Al-Kahf 26). In the recitation of Ibn \u2018Amir, one of the seven reciters, it comes in the form of a forbiddance: \u2018Do not commit shirk with anyone in His rule.\u2019 Likewise, Allah said concerning the act of committing shirk in His worship, \u2018Whoever longs to meet His Lord \u2013 let him do righteous deeds and not commit shirk with anyone in the worship of his Lord\u2019 (Al-Kahf 110). Both commands are equal, as is clearly seen.\u201d\nHe then said, \u201cWhat this noble verse entails \u2013 that rule belongs to Allah alone, without partner, according to both recitations \u2013 has been further explained in other verses.\u201d  He  then  mentioned  from  among  them  Allah\u2019s statement, \u201cThe rule is only for Allah. He has commanded that you worship only Him. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know\u201d (Yusuf 40), and His statement, \u201cIs it the rule of Jahiliyyah they want? But who is better than Allah in rule for a people who have firm faith\u201d (Al-Maidah 50), and His statement, \u201cIs it other than Allah I should seek as a judge while it is He who has revealed to you the Book explained in detail?\u201d (Al-An\u2019am  114).\nHe then said, \u201cWhat is understood from these verses\u2026 is that the followers of the rulings of lawmakers who legislate  what  Allah  has  not  permitted  are  committing shirk  with  Allah.  This  understanding  was  made  clear in  other  verses,  such  as  in  Allah\u2019s  statement  concerning those who follow Shaytan\u2019s legislation in permitting maytah [the meat of unslaughtered animals] under the pretext that they were slaughtered by Allah: \u2018Do not eat of that upon which the name of Allah has not been mentioned, for indeed, it is grave disobedience. Indeed the devils inspire their awliya [patrons] to dispute with you, and  if  you  were  to  obey  them,  indeed,  you  would  be mushrikin\u2019 (Al-An\u2019am 121). So he declared them to be mushrikin due to their obedience [to taghut legislation], and this shirk in obedience \u2013 following legislation that rivals what Allah has legislated \u2013 is what is meant by worshiping Shaytan in Allah\u2019s statement, \u2018Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Shaytan \u2013 [for] indeed, he is a clear enemy to you \u2013 and that you worship [only] Me? This is a straight path\u2019 (Yasin 60-61).\u201d\nHe then said, \u201cFor this reason, Allah named as \u2018shuraka\u2019 [partners] those who are obeyed in the sins they beautify. He \uf063 said, \u2018Likewise, the \u2018shuraka\u2019 of the mushrikin have beautified to them the killing of their children in order to bring about their destruction and to mislead them in  their  religion.  And  if  Allah  had  willed,  they  would not  have  done  so.  So  leave  them  and  that  which  they devise\u2019 (Al-An\u2019am 137). The Prophet \uf067 explained this to \u2018Adiy Ibn Hatim \uf068 when \u2018Adiy asked about Allah\u2019s statement,  \u2018They  took  their  rabbis  and  monks  as  lords besides Allah\u2019 (At-Tawbah 31). The Prophet \uf067 explained to  him  that  the  clergy  permitted  for  them  what  Allah \nhad prohibited, and prohibited for them what Allah had permitted, and the Jews and Christians followed them in that regard, and that was their taking of their clergy as lords. From the most explicit of evidences concerning this is that Allah \uf065 explained in Surat an-Nisa that He is amazed at the claim of faith from those who want to seek judgment from what Allah has not legislated, and that is only because their claim of having faith despite their desire to seek judgment from taghut reaches a level of lying so great that it is amazing, and this is in His statement, \u2018Have you not seen those who claim to have believed in what was revealed to you and what was revealed before you? They wish to seek judgment from taghut, while they were commanded to disbelieve in it; and Shaytan wishes to lead them far astray\u2019 (An-Nisa 60). Through these divine texts we have quoted, it becomes absolutely clear that none doubts the kufr and shirk of those who follow the  manmade  laws  which  Shaytan  has  legislated  upon the tongues of his allies in opposition to what Allah \uf065 has legislated upon the tongue of His messengers \uf070 except one whose vision Allah has wiped out and whom He has blinded from seeing the light of the revelation like He did to the followers of the taghut legislators\u201d (Adwa al-Bayan).\nAs  for  Allah\u2019s  statement,  \u201cIs  it  other  than  Allah  I should seek as a judge while it is He who has revealed to you the Book explained in detail?\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 114), then in pondering it there are many benefits. The author of \u201cAdwa al-Bayan\u201d said, \u201cSome scholars mentioned that some of the kuffar asked the Prophet \uf067 to seek judgment along with them from some of the soothsayers, as it was the custom of the Arabs \u2013 when they had disputes and disagreements \u2013 to seek judgment from some of the soothsayers, and Allah\u2019s refuge is sought.\u201d Allah \uf065 then revealed this verse and ordered the Prophet \uf067 \u201cto completely denounce those who seek a judge other than the Creator  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  who  is  the  Just Judge,  the  Subtly  Kind,  the  All  Aware\u201d  (Al-\u2018Adhb  anNamir).\nA similar verse is found in Surat al-An\u2019am. Allah \uf063 said,  \u201cSay,  \u2018Is  it  other  than  Allah  \u2013  the  Creator  of  the heavens and the earth \u2013 I should take as a wali [guardian], while it is He who feeds and is not fed?\u2019 Say, \u2018Indeed, I have been commanded to be the first who submits [to Allah] and [was commanded], \u2018Do not ever be of the mushrikin\u2019\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 14). He \uf063 also said, \u201cSay, \u2018Is it other than Allah I should want as a lord while He is the Lord of all things? No soul does evil except against itself, and no one shall bear another\u2019s burden. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ\u2019\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 164). He \uf065 also said in Surat al-A\u2019raf, \u201c[Musa] said, \u2018Is it other than Allah I should seek as a god for you while He has chosen you over all creation?\u2019\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 140).\nIbnul-Qayyim \uf072 said, \u201cOne\u2019s being pleased with Allah as his lord means that he does not take a lord other than Allah, trusting in its management of affairs and appealing  to  it  for  his  needs.  Allah  \uf063  said,  \u2018Say,  \u2018Is  it other  than  Allah  I  should  want  as  a  [rabb]  lord  while He is the Lord of creation?\u2019 (Al-An\u2019am 164).

And He mentioned to them that it is thanks to Him, His approval of them, and His appreciation of them, and not thanks to their numbers or their equipment. He warned them that victory comes from Him, whether the force has large or small numbers. On the Day of Hunayn, they were fooled by their numbers, for such was not useful to them  in  any  way.  They  retreated  in  defeat  with  the exception of a few who stayed with Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067.

He should be wary of Iblis and his whispers, as he very often tempts the changing of intentions and does not tire of doing so until the soul parts the body. The mujahid must let his heart always be attached to Allah alone, letting nothing sever this attachment. He should be wary of statements that may quickly change hearts,  like  \u201cthe  istishhadi  causes  much  damage  to Allah\u2019s enemies and is decisive in the battle,\u201d or like \u201csince we have such a weapon, we will not be defeated and we will not be vanquished,\u201d or like \u201cthe weapons we have prepared are sufficient to defeat the enemies.\u201d Let the mujahid\u2019s state, words, and sure faith in his heart be there, for there is no reliance nor dependence on what he has prepared, no matter how great, but only in compliance with the order of Allah.\nO mujahid!

Allah c said, \u201cUnquestionably, His is the creation and the command; blessed is Allah, Lord of the creation\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 54). He c also said, \u201cRule  is  not  but  for Allah.

The tawaghit have taken them away from the true religion, at times through the means of the scholars of misguidance, and at times through the means of their corrupt media, which had them showing allegiance to the tawaghit and showing enmity to the mujahidin under the pretext of countering terrorism. And this is an apparent act of apostasy from the religion of Islam, so it is upon them to hasten to repent from it, and thereafter it is upon them to not expose the mujahidin\u2019s secrets, and to cover them.

Yes, the soldiers of the Islamic State \u2013 without exception \u2013 are all prepared to  fight  in  the  cause  of  Allah  down  to  their  last drop  of  blood.

He also clarified what there was of severe poverty and widespread illnesses in Madinah, as well as the fear that used to govern the lives of the Muslims in this blessed state, so much so that they didn\u2019t feel safe from the kuffar outside the state invading them, nor from the munafiqin inside the state betraying them, and much more aside from  that  from  among  the  signs  of  weakness  which nevertheless did not detract a single bit from the value of the state of the Prophet g, nor from the obligation on the Muslims to always endeavor to make it their goal to establish a state in the same mold and to tread upon its methodology.\nFor this reason, when the Islamic State of Iraq was established, the followers of the deviant groups and the parties of fitnah were among the first to defame it, and what they used to criticize about it most was the poverty it  contained  and  the  mushrikin\u2019s  ability  to  kill  and imprison its soldiers, turning a blind eye to the condition which the state of the Prophet gwas in, and ignoring the fact that a state only becomes an Islamic state due to the rulings of the Shari\u2019ah being superior therein, and not due to the number of gold bars or piles of dollar bills in the coffers of its central bank, nor due to the size of its army or the number of planes flying in its skies.\nThe Sahabah\u2019s Society\u2026The Best Ummah Brought \nForth for Mankind\nLikewise,  the  deviants  who  associate  themselves with Islam persisted in their lies and in distorting the reality of an Islamic state, altering the characteristics of its people by depicting them as being angels who neither sin nor make mistakes, and who never transgress against one another, and who have no dunya-related concerns, and who are simply busy with worship, dhikr, praying, and fasting. So they painted this fanciful image of the Muslim society, and in reality, this society which they painted in the minds of their followers had never existed before on the earth for a single day, nor will it ever exist until Allah inherits the earth and those upon it. And \nit  is  not  required  that  a  society  fulfill  those  fanciful conditions  in  order  to  merit  the  description  of  being Islamic. Rather, it is sufficient for a society that Islam is what is manifested by the majority of its people and that they are ruled by the shari\u2019ah of Islam.\nIndeed,  the  society  of  the  companions  of  Allah\u2019s Messenger gis the best society to have ever existed on the earth, and those who lived in this society were among the best of the creation of Allah c. Allah c said, \u201cYou are  the  best  nation  brought  forth  for  mankind.  You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah. If only the People of the Scripture had believed, it would have been better for them. Among them are believers, but most of them are defiantly disobedient\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 110). And the companions of the Prophet Muhammad  g  are  better  than  the  companions  and disciples of the previous prophets, and there has never been in any society in terms of submitting to the rule of Allah the likes of that which was found in the society of the Sahabah. And without any doubt, it is a shar\u2019i obligation  for  any  society  of  Muslims  to  endeavor  to become  like  the  society  of  the  companions  of  Allah\u2019s Messenger  g  in  terms  of  their  iman,  their  worship, their justice, their concern in practicing the Sunnah, and their  jihad.\nBut if in the society of Muslims there exist people who make mistakes, or people who disobey Allah  c or who fall into committing oppression, or there occurs something  of  dispute  over  some  aspect  of  this  base dunya, or the Muslims are infiltrated by munafiqin \u2013 whether they are few or many in number \u2013 this does not negate the goodness of that society, nor do these issues detract from that society\u2019s Islamic nature as long as the good that is found within it is prevalent and the evil that it contains is fought, and as long as the justice that is found within it is prevalent and the injustice it contains is fought.\nAnd  we  can  go  back  to  the  ideal  society  \u2013  the society  of  the  Sahabah  \uf06a  \u2013  in  order  to  see  an example of this society\u2019s human nature, for among the Sahabah were people who made mistakes and sought forgiveness, and disobeyed Allah and repented. And among them were people who associated themselves with them but in reality were not from among them. On the surface, they were Muslims, but on the inside, they were disbelievers. Among them were many who died upon nifaq, and being members of this righteous society did not benefit them in any way, nor did their companionship of the leader of mankind g benefit them.\nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Foreword", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah8-Military-and-Covert-Operations", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "As the soldiers of the Khilafah continue waging war on the forces of kufr, we take a glimpse at a number of  recent  operations  conducted  by  the  mujahidin  of the Islamic State that have succeeded in expanding the territory of the Khilafah, or terrorizing, massacring, and  humiliating  the  enemies  of  Allah.  These  operations  are  merely  a  selection  of  the  numerous  operations that the Islamic State has conducted on various fronts across many regions over the course of the last few weeks.\nJazair Wilayah\nOn the 28th of Jumada al-Ula, one of the soldiers of  the  Khilafah  in  Jazair  \uf08a  set  out  and  conducted an istishhadi operation using an explosives-laden bag with which he targeted a police station belonging to the murtadd Jazairi police force in the middle of the city of Qusantinah.\nSalahuddin Wilayah\nOn the 1st of Jumada al-Akhirah, three inghimasi soldiers of the Khilafah, Abu Salih al-\u2018Iraqi, Abul-Yaman al-\u2018Iraqi, and Abu Fuad al-\u2018Iraqi \uf08d, set out with their explosive vests towards an intelligence base belonging  to  the  Rafidi  Salam  Detachments  militia on  the  outskirts  of  the  city  of  Samarra.  They  infiltrated the base, following which fierce clashes broke out that led to all those inside the base being killed. The inghimasiyyin then confronted a Rafidi convoy of  reinforcements,  and  after  exhausting  their  supply of ammo, they detonated their explosive vests on the murtaddin. The blessed operation resulted in 27 murtaddin being killed and wounded, and among those dead  was  the  intelligence  base  officer,  Abu  Mahdi. This was in addition to the buildings and vehicles suffering  an  extensive  amount  of  damage.\nOn  the  9th  of  Jumada  al-Akhirah,  two  soldiers of  the  Khilafah,  Abu  \u2018Abdillah  ash-Shami  and  Abu \n26News\n\fpointed to the blessing of health in what was reported by al-Bukhari in his al-Adab al-Mufrad and the other books of as-Sunan where the Prophet says, \u201cWhoever awakens secure with regards to his self, has his body in good health, and has his food for that day, it is as if he possesses the Dunya.\u201d Likewise, Imam al-Bukhari r reported in his sahih that Ibn \u2018Abbas k narrated that the Prophet g said, \u201cThere are two blessings that many  people  are  heedless  of:  health  and  free  time.\u201d Ibnul-Battal r says, while explaining this magnificent hadith, \u201cThe meaning of the hadith is that a person doesn\u2019t have free time until his needs are sufficed and his body is healthy. So whoever achieves that, then let him be vigilant not to become heedless in thanking Allah for what He has blessed him with, and from the means of giving Him thanks is to act upon His commands and abstain from what He has forbidden. So whoever is neglectful concerning that is heedless.\u201d\nThe Prohibition of Spoiling the Body\nWhat is strange with some people is that they spoil their health with that which Allah c has prohibited of  the  destructive  and  evil  things,  such  as  cigarettes and  intoxicants  that  make  absent  the  intellect  and cripple it in varying degrees, and which severely harm the body. Such things, and others from among that which is prohibited are a slow death, and a means of destroying the body, and Allah c forbade killing oneself when He said, \u201cAnd do not kill yourselves. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful\u201d (An-Nisa 29). And as such,  the  venerable  Shari\u2019ah  came  to  safeguard  the religion and the people, and for the sake of religion people  are  sacrificed  cheaply  by  way  of  jihad  in  Allah\u2019s cause until there is no more fitnah and all of the religion is for Allah. Apart from that, it is not permissible  for  the  Muslim  to  inflict  harm  upon  his  body or do something that harms his health, whatever the reason may be. Al-Hakim reported in his Mustadrak, from Jabir, that a man from the people of at-Tufayl Ibn  \u2018Amr  ad-Dawsi  made  hijrah  with  at-Tufayl  and then  became  sick.  He  said,  \u201cHe  became  discontent, so  he  came  to  a  quiver,  took  an  arrow,  and  cut  the veins in his hands and died. At-Tufayl saw him in a dream  and  said,  \u2018What  did  Allah  do  with  you?\u2019  He said, \u2018He forgave me due to my hijrah to the Prophet g.\u2019 So he said, \u2018What happened to your hands?\u2019 He said, \u2018It was said to me, \u2018We will not repair what you have corrupted of yourself.\u2019\u2019 So at-Tufayl narrated the story to the Prophet g and he g said, \u2018O Allah, and \nforgive him for his hands,\u2019 and he raised his hands.\u201d So that was a man who didn\u2019t intend to kill himself, however his action led to his death, and Allah forgave him due to his hijrah, as that is what is apparent from the supplication of the Prophet g for him. Therefore, contemplate what was said to him: \u201cI will not repair what you have corrupted of yourself,\u201d for this body is not to be ruined except in pursuit of Allah\u2019s pleasure and in maintaining obedience to Him, not due to the whims of the soul and its pleasures and impulses.\nPatience upon Sickness\u2026 A Sunnah of \nthe Prophets and the Manhaj of the Righteous\nBetween the blessing of health and the blessing of being  cured,  it  is  essential  for  every  Muslim  to  put their trust in their Lord and to utilize the means for remedy. If he is cured then verily it is from Allah alone, and if he does not recover then he should think well of his Lord \u2013 in that He wills by it to raise his station and erase his sins by means of all of that which befalls him from the different types of physical and mental harm. Therefore, the Muslim seeks his reward through patience  in  the  face  of  affliction,  for  that  is  the  situation  of  the  believer  in  both  easy  and  hard  times. Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported that the Prophet g said, \u201cNothing afflicts the Muslim of fatigue, illness, anxiety, grief, harm, or depression \u2013 even if it were the prick of a thorn \u2013 except that Allah expiates by that his sins.\u201d Due to this, some of the Salaf would rejoice if they fell sick, for verily those tested most severely are the prophets, then those resembling them, and then those resembling them. Imam al-Bukhari reported in his sahih from al-Harith Ibn Suwayd, from \u2018Abdullah that he said, \u201cI entered upon the Messenger of Allah g while he was suffering from fever, so I wiped him and said, \u2018Verily you are suffering a severe fever.\u2019 So he said, \u2018Verily, I suffer the likes of what two of you suffer.\u2019 I said, \u2018Is that because for you are two rewards?\u2019 He said, \u2018Indeed it is so. Likewise, there is no Muslim who is afflicted with harm \u2013 a pricking of a thorn or more than that \u2013 except that Allah expiates by it his sins just as a tree drops its leaves.\u2019\u201d Likewise, the Prophet of Allah Ayyub n was struck with an ailment that afflicted him for a prolonged time, and Allah c praised  him  for  his  patience.  He  said,  \u201cIndeed,  We found him patient, an excellent slave. Indeed, he was one repeatedly turning back (to Allah)\u201d (Sad 44). He then supplicated to Allah his Lord, but not in a direct  manner.  Rather,  it  was  with  excellent  manners \n\f", "schema:headline": "Military and Covert Operations", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "25"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah7-Rely-on-Allah,-Not-on-Your-Equipment", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "No  two  Muslims  would  disagree  that  preparing for jihad for the cause of Allah is an obligation. Allah urged people to this duty in His book when He \uf063 said, \u201cPrepare against them whatever you are able of power  and  of  steeds  of  war  by  which  you  may  terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides  them  whom  you  do  not  know  [but]  whom Allah knows. And whatever you spend in the cause of Allah will be fully repaid to you, and you will not be wronged\u201d (Al-Anfal 60). So there is no doubt that preparation is a factor that contributes to victory and success against the enemy.\nBy Allah\u2019s grace, the soldiers of the Khilafah have complied with this divine command. They prepared as much as Allah has made possible for them, a good amount  of  which  the  enemy  has  seen,  and  what  is coming is more severe and bitter, by Allah\u2019s permission.\nHowever, a muwahhid Muslim should not rely and depend on what he has prepared. Rather, he should count on the might and power of Allah instead of his own might and power. He should not be tempted by this power in any way, because even if readiness is one of the factors of victory, being conceited with it is a factor of defeat.\nWe have a good example in the life of the Sahabah of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067. We also have a lesson from what they went through on the Day of Hunayn. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cAllah has already given you victory in many arenas and on the Day of Hunayn, when your great number pleased you, but it did not avail you at all, and the earth was confining for you with its vastness; then you turned back, fleeing. Then Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers and sent down soldiers whom you did not see and punished those who disbelieved. And that is the \nArticle\fConcerning  the  statement  of  Allah  \uf063,  \u201cOnly those of His slaves who have knowledge fear Allah\u201d (Fatir 28), Ibn Taymiyyah \uf072 said, \u201cThe meaning is that none fears Him except a scholar, for Allah has informed us that everyone who fears Allah is a scholar, as He stated in another ayah: \u2018Is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night, prostrating and standing  [in  prayer],  mindful  of  the  Hereafter  and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, [like one who does not]? Say, \u2018Are those who know equal to those who do not know?\u2019 It is only the people of understanding who will remember\u2019 (Az-Zumar 9). Fear always comprises hope, and if not for that it would have been security. So those who fear Allah and have hope in Him are the people of knowledge whom Allah has aided.\n\u201cIt  has  been  narrated  that  Abu  Hayyan  at-Taymi  said,  \u2018The  scholars  are  of  three  types:  One  who is knowledgeable of Allah but not knowledgeable of Allah\u2019s affair, one who is knowledgeable of Allah\u2019s affair  but  not  knowledgeable  of  Allah,  and  one  who is knowledgeable of Allah and knowledgeable of Allah\u2019s affair. The one who is knowledgeable of Allah is the one who fears Him, and the one who is knowledgeable of Allah\u2019s affair is the one who knows His commands and prohibitions.\u2019 Likewise, the Prophet \uf067 said, \u2018Indeed, I hope to be the most fearful of Allah among you and the most knowledgeable of that which he is mindful of\u2019 (Reported by Muslim from \u2018Aishah).\n\u201cIf those who fear Allah are the scholars, who are praised in the Book and the Sunnah, then they do not deserve to be disparaged, and this is only the case if they perform the obligatory deeds. This is indicated by the statement of Allah \uf063, \u2018So their Lord inspired to them, \u2018We will surely destroy the wrongdoers. And We  will  surely  cause  you  to  dwell  in  the  land  after them. That is for he who fears My position and fears My  threat\u2019\u2019  (Ibrahim  13-14).  This  is  also  indicated by  His  statement,  \u2018And  for  he  who  fears  the  position  of  his  Lord  are  two  gardens\u2019  (Ar-Rahman  46). So  He  promised  victory  in  the  Dunya  and  reward in the Hereafter for those who feared Him, and this is only because they performed what was obligatory upon them. This is evidence that fear necessitates the performance of that which is obligatory, and for this reason it is said that an immoral person does not fear Allah. The evidence for this is the statement of Allah \uf063, \u2018The repentance accepted by Allah is only for those who do wrong in ignorance [or carelessness] and then repent soon after\u2019 (An-Nisa 17).\nOne Knowledgeable of Allah Will Obey Him\n\u201cAbul-\u2018Aliyah  said,  \u2018I  asked  the  companions  of Muhammad about this ayah, and they said, \u2018Everyone who disobeys Allah is ignorant, and anyone who repents before death has repented soon after [his sin].\u2019\u2019 And the rest of the scholars of tafsir have stated likewise.  Mujahid  said,  \u2018Every  sinner  is  ignorant  at  the time of committing his sin.\u2019 Likewise, al-Hasan, Qatadah, \u2018Ata, as-Suddi, and others have said, \u2018They were only called ignorant due to their sins, and not because they  couldn\u2019t  distinguish  [between  good  and  evil].\u2019 Az-Zajjaj said, \u2018The meaning of the ayah isn\u2019t that they were ignorant of it being something evil, because if a Muslim commits a sin that he is ignorant of, he is like one who has not committed any evil. So it is only one of two possibilities: The first is that they committed it  while  ignorant  of  the  disliked  matter  it  contains. The second is that they committed it while knowing and comprehending that its consequence is disliked, preferring what they would gain from it immediately over what they would gain in the Hereafter [from leaving it], and as such they were called ignorant for preferring that which is little over abundant comfort and permanent wellbeing.\u2019 Here, az-Zajjaj has made ignorance to be either not knowing the consequence of the deed, or being corrupt in what one desires. It might be said that these two things are related, and this is further expounded on in the discussion about the  Jahmiyyah.\n\u201cWhat is intended here is that everyone who disobeys Allah is ignorant, and anyone who fears Him is a scholar who is obedient to Allah, and one only becomes ignorant due to a decrease in his fear of Allah, because if one\u2019s fear of Allah had been complete he would not have sinned. Likewise, there is the statement of Ibn Mas\u2019ud \uf068, \u2018It is sufficient in terms of knowledge for one to fear Allah, and it is sufficient in terms of ignorance for one to be deceived concerning Allah.\u2019 This is because envisioning the object of one\u2019s fear necessitates fleeing from it, and envisioning the  object  of  one\u2019s  love  necessitates  seeking  it,  so  if one does not flee from the first and does not seek the second, it indicates that he has not envisioned it completely. He might, however, envision what is reported about it, but envisioning what is reported, affirming it, and memorizing its letters is not the same as envisioning that which is being reported about. Likewise is the case if he neither loves nor hates that which he envisions, for the human being may affirm that which \n\f", "schema:headline": "Rely on Allah, Not on Your Equipment", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "11"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah8-Those-Who-Seek-the-Judgment-of-the-Tawaghit", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "Allah  c  said,  \u201cDid  you  not  see  those  who  claim they believe in what was revealed to you and what was revealed before you, (yet) they want to seek judgment from taghut, though they were ordered to disbelieve therein,  and  Shaytan  wants  to  lead  them  far  astray. And when it was said to them, \u2018Come to what Allah revealed and to the Messenger,\u2019 you saw the munafiqin holding  back  from  you  in  avoidance.  So  how  then, when an affliction struck them due to what their own hands brought forth, they then came to you, swearing by Allah, \u2018We did not want anything but well-doing and successful outcome\u2019\u201d (An-Nisa 60-62).\nWhoever  recognizes  that  there  is  no  god  except Allah  must  also  comply  with  His  hukm  (rule  and judgment) and submit to His command, which was brought forth from Him through His Messenger, Muhammad g. So whoever testifies that there is no god except Allah, and then defers to the judgment of other than the Messenger g in matters of dispute, then he has lied in his testimony.\nTawhid is based upon the two testimonies, and one is not said without the other due to their inseparability. And just as the testimony that, \u201cThere is no god except Allah,\u201d comprises the right of Allah over His slaves, \n34Article\n\fFor years following its establishment, the Khilafah has  called  on  Muslims  around  the  world  to  rise  up and wage jihad against the enemies of Allah in order to raise high His word, and to unite under the banner of the jama\u2019ah of the Muslims. This call was met with a forceful response as several groups of mujahidin around the world quickly closed ranks and declared their bay\u2019ah to Amirul-Muminin, with some of them uniting  with  other  mujahid  factions  in  their  region and nominating an individual from among themselves to be appointed by the Khalifah as their amir.\nThus,  the  Khilafah  quickly  expanded  beyond  its territories in Iraq and Sham, two lands from the lands of the Muslims that had been usurped by the Crusaders and carved up among themselves through the use of artificial borders that were upheld throughout the rule of their taghut puppets. The Khilafah expanded beyond Iraq and Sham after destroying their artificial border, uniting their territories, and establishing the Shari\u2019ah therein, thereby demonstrating that the Ummah\u2019s unity was not beyond reach, as long as it was pursued  on  the  basis  of  the  tawhid  of  Allah.  It  was this form of unity to which the Islamic State called the mujahidin \u2013 a form of unity that gave tawhid its proper due, as opposed to sacrificing it for the sake of temporary political gain \u2013 and it was this form of unity that the truthful mujahidin around the world had long awaited. So when the Khilafah made its call, the response  echoed  from  every  direction\u2026  from  Sinai, Libya, Jazair, Yemen, and the Arabian Peninsula.\nThe  mujahidin  were  being  mobilized  to  unite upon tawhid and to form a unified front against every mushrik in every corner of the earth, just as Allah c had commanded them, \u201cAnd fight the mushrikin collectively just as they fight you collectively\u201d (At-Tawbah 36). The war against kufr soon intensified as the mushrikin  rallied  in  an  attempt  to  stop  the  Islamic State\u2019s  expansion  and  bring  an  end  to  the  threat  it posed. But one after another the mujahid factions continued to unite under the Khilafah\u2019s banner. Khurasan, West Africa, Somalia, East Asia, Mali\u2026 the phenomenon swept through the lands of the Muslims, and in every  region  where  bay\u2019ah  was  given,  attacks  would follow. The mujahidin marched forth and struck the kuffar wherever they found them, not differentiating between a Crusading mushrik and a murtadd puppet.Such was the case when eight inghimasi soldiers of the Khilafah set out to raid a Russian National Guard base near the village of Naurskaya, northwest of the Chechen  city  of  Grozny  in  Qawqaz  Wilayah.  They \nused the foggy weather and the darkness of night to their advantage, advancing towards the military base, and the fact that they were armed with nothing but knives didn\u2019t make them hesitant in fighting the disbelieving enemies of Allah. Rather, it served as a sign of their truthfulness to Him. This small group of mujahidin \u2013 who spent ten days training for the operation \u2013 then attacked the soldiers in the base with their knives and  seized  their  weapons.  They  then  clashed  with them for several hours, killing at least six of them and injuring  three  others.  Six  of  the  mujahidin  attained shahadah during the course of the operation, and the remaining two returned safely back to their locations.The  daring  raid  on  the  Russian  base  in  Chechnya  coincided  with  another  operation  by  the  soldiers of the Khilafah several thousand kilometers away in Bengal. The istishhadi Abu Muhammad al-Bengali \uf08a made his way towards one of the checkpoints of the international airport in the city of Dhaka, where he entered into the midst of a group of murtadd Bengali policemen and detonated his explosive vest, killing at least three of them and injuring a number of others. Just one day later, dozens of murtadd Bengali forces personnel were killed and wounded when an explosive device was detonated on a group of them in the region of Sylhet as they were attempting to raid one of the mujahidin\u2019s bases. The soldiers of the Khilafah also carried out an operation a week prior, with one of the mujahidin targeting a special forces base in the area of Ashkuna located in Dhaka with an explosive vest.\nThe operations in Bengal and Qawqaz shook the ranks of the murtaddin and Crusaders, with the mujahidin in Bengal establishing their ability to confront and bleed the capabilities of the murtadd forces and target their most prominent commanders, as occurred in the operation in Sylhet, which resulted in the killing of the murtadd officer, Lieutenant Colonel Abul Kalam Azad, Director of Intelligence in Rapid Action Battalion. Likewise, the mujahidin in Qawqaz established their ability to target Russian Crusader forces and take them by surprise even in their military bases. These operations thus reminded all the sects of kufr that the battalions of the Islamic State in all corners of the earth will persist in their campaign to uproot their armies\u2019 forces wherever they\u2019re found, until the word of Allah is the highest and the word of the disbelievers is the lowest.\nMay  Allah  accept  our  shuhada  and  replace  them with those who will continue to carry the banner of tawhid  after  them.

Such attacks have been behind the destruction of towns, neighborhoods, and public, private, and governmental property, while likewise claiming numerous lives.\nRecently, on 15 Safar 1438AH, a soldier of the Khilafah stationed in Russia taught the despicable Crusaders a lesson on just how destructive an operation of such simplicity can be, successfully burning down a 3-story furniture factory in its entirety, as well as a chemical factory adjacent to it, both located in Losino-Petrovsky, a town northeast of Moscow. The fire was initiated on the ground floor, where it subsequently spread to the remaining floors and the neighboring buildings and continued to burn for three whole days, causing great financial losses for the Russian Crusaders.\nLikewise, the whole world witnessed the devastating fires that ravaged  Jewish  settlements  in  Palestine,  destroying  around  700 Jewish  homes.  Irrespective  of  the  motive,  this  deliberate  act  of destruction  demonstrated  the  lethality  of  such  an  effortless  operation. The attacks likewise demonstrate that with some simple \nArticle\fShaykh Zuwayd and its surrounding areas.\nAs for the Jariri tariqah, it has three main lodges. It has the Arab lodge in Isma\u2019iliyyah and the Sa\u2019ud lodge in the eastern region, and they are both in the land of Egypt. In Sinai, the tariqah has the Rawdah lodge, which many other lodges are affiliated with, such as the lodges in the neighborhood of Abu Jarir, and the areas of Tawil and Sabah, as well as others.\nThe  Ahmadi  tariqah  emerged  approximately  half  a century ago at the hands of Abu Ahmad al-\u2018Alawi al-Filistini, who came from Gaza. Its headquarters was in the area of Tumah, and the Jurah lodge is affiliated with it.\nWhen al-\u2018Alawi died, he bequeathed the lodge to his son  Mustafa  but  made  Khalaf  al-Khalfat  its  trustee  due to Mustafa\u2019s young age. From there, the taghut Khalaf became a head of the tariqah and Jurah became the mother-lodge. Then, this murtadd also died. He was buried in the Jurah lodge and his grave became a tomb with a green dome.\nAs for the Jariri tariqah, it was established by the taghut  \u2018Id  Abu  Jarir  and  was  centered  in  the  three  aforementioned lodges \u2013 the Sa\u2019ud lodge, the Arab lodge, and the Rawdah lodge \u2013 which the Islamic State will eradicate, inshaallah, as soon as it conquers the areas hosting those lodges.\nThe Jariri tariqah is more widespread and has more influence than the Ahmadi tariqah. It is also more extreme in deviance.\nQuestion: What are the worst practices of bid\u2019ah and \nshirk that these Sufi tariqas engage in?\nAnswer:  Shirk  has  become  very  widespread  in  the midst of these tariqas, to the extent that those senior in \nage grew old upon it, and those young in age were raised upon  it.  Indeed,  the  disaster  was  immense.\nThese  Sufis  believe  that  the  dead  have  the  power  to bring about harm and benefit. Hence, they direct various types of worship towards the dead, such as du\u2019a, tawakkul, sacrificial slaughter, and tawaf (circumambulation). They also claim that the dead are intermediaries between them and Allah \uf063 just as human kings have intermediaries between themselves and their subjects. Allah is far exalted above the mushrikin\u2019s claim. Likewise, they follow their tawaghit and shuyukh in their falsehood, and they blindly obey them in all statements and deeds.\nAll the Sufi tariqas in the world today share in these matters,  while  having  minor  differences  between  them. All the Sufi tariqas that we have known, heard of, or read about have fallen into shirk in one way or another.\nThe followers of the Ahmadi tariqah believe in hulul (panentheism) and ittihad (pantheism) \u2013 and Allah\u2019s refuge is sought \u2013 and they say that Allah \uf063 \u201cstays in everything that is still and moves in everything that moves\u201d! He is far exalted above what they say. Likewise, they venerate Ibn \u2018Arabi, al-Hallaj, and other imams of kufr and deviance.\nAs  for  the  Jariri  tariqah,  they  are  more  known  for grave-worship.  They  venerate  tombs,  perform  sacrificial slaughter for them, perform tawaf around them, and so on. This tariqah has a connection to the religion of the Rafidah. The one who authored the book of poetry titled \u201cBustan al-Mahabbah\u201d (The Garden of Love) \u2013 which they venerate and consider to be like a \u201cquran\u201d \u2013 is the dead Rafidi, an-Nimr al-Laythi, whose home was in Tanta.\nFrom among the rituals of worship practiced by the Sufis  in  Sinai  \u2013  like  Sufis  elsewhere  \u2013  is  what  they  call \u201cHadrah,\u201d which is their gathering together on the night \nA Sufi shirki lodge outside the territory of the Khilafah in Sinai \n\f", "schema:headline": "Just Terror Tactics: Part 3", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "7"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah8-And-Worship-Your-Lord-until-Death-Comes-to-You", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "Indeed, if Allah blesses one of His slaves, He makes for him his external the same as his internal and makes his statements to be in accordance with his actions, and he doesn\u2019t make him a munafiq in his belief or one whose actions contradict his  speech.\nThis is what Allah blessed the Islamic State with \u2013 due to His grace c \u2013 in many ways which can\u2019t be counted. From the main blessings is the purpose of its existence, and the reason for its formation \u2013 that is the establishment of the religion and ruling by the Shari\u2019ah.\nSo it opposed those who are misguided and who misguide others, from amongst the fractured and opposing  factions  and  the  parties  of  detriment,  those who filled the earth with their declarations and theories concerning their endeavor to establish the religion and their ambition to achieve that as soon as they have authority  and  take  power.  Then  it  became  apparent that their slogans were mere lies, and they broke their promises as soon as they achieved what they wanted, so they ruled by the legislations of the tawaghit, giving preference to the survival of their symbols and organi-\nzations as opposed to establishing the religion. Every time Allah opened for the Islamic State an area of land and they were empowered therein, its soldiers would hasten in establishing Allah\u2019s religion and ordering the people with good and forbidding them from evil, despite their certain knowledge that this matter would incite the kuffar against them and enrage the hearts of the munafiqin in opposition to them, however they sought through it the pleasure of the Lord of the creation.\nThe most soothing thing to the eyes of the muwahhid today is that he sees in every part of the Islamic State that the prayer is established and the zakat is collected, virtue is commanded and vice is forbidden, and that the hudud is carried out, despite the fact that the battle fronts are ignited on all sides.\nThe lions of Islam can be seen writing history, sacrificing  their  blood  and  their  lives,  as  they  confront the campaigns of the mushrikin on the outskirts of a city, while at the same time the adhan is called and the Muslims gather for prayer despite being only a street or two away from the ignited battle fronts. Likewise, \n4Foreword\n\fSo it was that the believers hoped to meet the caravan of Quraysh, so that they could take it easily without a fight and seize its spoils to empower them and hold them over for some time. But Allah c wanted \u2013 with His knowledge and wisdom \u2013 that the caravan should escape and that Quraysh should mobilize, determined to fight the Muslims with an army that exceeded three times the number of the Muslims. They hoped thereby to finish off the Muslims, who had begun to tarnish the standing of Quraysh, affecting them and their business dealings. Thus came to pass the Major Battle of Badr, about which Allah said, \u201cWhen Allah promised you one of the two groups, that it would be yours, and you wished that the unarmed one would be yours. But Allah intended to establish the truth by His words and to eliminate the disbelievers, so that He should establish the truth and abolish falsehood, even if the criminals disliked it\u201d (Al-Anfal 7-8).\nAlso,  Allah  c  made  the  kuffar  seem  few  in  the believers\u2019 eyes, so that they would be encouraged to fight them and not fear them. Likewise, He made the believers  seem  few  in  the  kuffar\u2019s  eyes,  thereby  luring them into fighting them. He c said, \u201cWhen He showed them to you, when you met, as few in your eyes, and He made you appear as few in their eyes, so that Allah might accomplish a matter already destined. And to Allah all matters are returned\u201d (Al-Anfal 44). Then, when the two sides met, the kuffar saw the Muslims as if they were double the number of kuffar. So the army of kufr was shaken, their morale declined, their strength waned, they lost hope of victory, and Allah empowered the believers with His support. He c said, \u201cAlready there has been for you a sign in the two armies which met \u2013 one fighting in the cause of Allah and another of disbelievers. They saw them as if twice their own number in their eyes. But Allah empowers with His support whom He wills. Indeed in that is a lesson for those with insight\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 13).\ngreat and much of it is unknown to us.\nIn the Battle of Ahzab, Allah c tested the believers with a hard and unexpected test, but it only increased them in having iman that the promise of Allah and His Messenger g, regarding the believers\u2019 victory and the disbelievers\u2019 defeat, would be realized.\nAllah c said, \u201cO you who believe, remember the favor of Allah upon you when armies came to attack you and We sent upon them a wind and armies (of angels),  which  you  did  not  see\u201d  (Al-Ahzab  9).  Ibn Kathir  said,  \u201cAllah c  is  referring  here  to  His  favor, bounty, and generosity to His believing slaves when \nHe repelled their enemies and defeated them in the year they gathered and rallied against them. That was the year of the Khandaq (Trench) in Shawwal of the fifth year after the hijrah\u2026 The mushrikin came and camped  east  of  Madinah,  near  Uhud,  and  a  group of them camped on the high ground of Madinah, as Allah  c  said,  \u2018When  they  came  at  you  from  above you and from below you\u2019 (Al-Ahzab 10). Allah\u2019s Messenger g went out with between seven-hundred and three-thousand Muslims, putting their backs to Sal\u2019 [a mountain at the market of Madinah] and their faces towards the enemy.\u201d This mobilization of the kuffar was a hard trial for the Muslims. Ibn Kathir continues, \u201cThe situation was difficult and harsh, and the condition was tight, as Allah c said, \u2018There the believers were tested and shaken with a severe shaking\u2019 (Al-Ahzab 11). They remained there, besieging the Prophet g and his companions for nearly a month.\u201d\nThen came the support of Allah c, after that hardship and adversity, in an amazing way that showed Allah\u2019s ability, power, might, wisdom, and His kindness to the believers. He c said, \u201cAllah repelled those who disbelieved,  in  their  rage,  not  having  obtained  any good. And sufficient was Allah for the believers in battle, and ever is Allah Powerful and Exalted in Might\u201d (Al-Ahzab 25). And Allah c empowered the believers with  victory  over  and  massacre  of  the  Jews  of  Bani Quraydhah, and then blessed the believers with many spoils,  which  He  caused  them  to  inherit  from  Bani Quraydhah.  He  c  said,  \u201cHe  brought  down  those who supported them among the People of the Book from their fortresses and cast terror into their hearts [so that] a party you killed, and you took captive a party. And He caused you to inherit their land and their homes and their properties and a land which you have not trodden. And ever is Allah, over all things, competent\u201d  (Al-Ahzab  26-27).\nIndeed, it is Allah\u2019s promise that He has fulfilled for His slaves after He tried and tested them, until the munafiqin left their ranks and the believers increased in solidarity and trust in that promise. So victory came to them from where they did not expect. We ask Allah to grant victory, honor, and consolidation to His slaves the mujahidin, and all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of  the creation.\n\f", "schema:headline": "And Worship Your Lord until Death Comes to You", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah7-What-They-Never-Told-Me", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of the creation, and may peace and blessings be upon the one who was sent with a sword as a mercy to mankind.\nAfter coming to Islam, I was given a pile of guides compiled for the new Muslim. These books and booklets explained the five pillars of Islam and the six pillars of iman, and also taught how to perform wudu and salah. At first, I thought this was quite a lot, as I had previously seen the lack of religious adherence by so-called \u201cMuslims\u201d \u2013 those whom I had thought to be Muslims \u2013 who didn\u2019t pray, possibly fasted during Ramadan, and whose extent of following the Shari\u2019ah was restricted to the avoidance of eating pork. After my iman started to root deeper and I gained a better understanding of what Islam really means, I started to wonder how these customary \u201cMuslims,\u201d who would neither pray nor fast, could even call themselves Muslims.\nWhen I asked about this problem, I received varying answers from both lay \u201cMuslims\u201d and supposedly knowledgeable \u201cMuslims.\u201d The responses were so different, I couldn\u2019t decide which one of them to follow. Most of them claimed that even if a person doesn\u2019t \npray, he can still be considered a Muslim. Perhaps due to the number of those who said that, I decided to follow that claim without investigating the topic any further.\nI didn\u2019t face this particular matter again until sometime later. Then, someone who was braver than most of the others, dared to open his mouth and say that leaving the salah is, indeed, kufr. This time, I couldn\u2019t let the matter rest, so I decided to start looking for an  answer  to  this  question  myself.  I  started  to  read books about \u2018aqidah. One of them mentioned something that I had never heard of before as a Muslim: the nullifiers of Islam. I was shocked! This was partly because I had never given thought to such a serious matter, and partly because nowhere else was I taught that, \u201cYes! In a blink of an eye, you can nullify your Islam and go from being a Muslim to being a murtadd kafir!\u201d\nKufr and riddah are two words that are taboo in the \u201cMuslim\u201d community of Finland. Few dare to utter them aloud and even fewer dare to accuse anyone of falling into them. But what is most dangerous is that most of them don\u2019t even know that there are ac-\nExclusive\n\fKnow, may Allah have mercy on you, that \u201cLa ilaha illallah\u201d is the supreme, most honorable, and most valuable  statement.  Whoever  holds  onto  it  shall  be safe and protected. The Messenger of Allah \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever says, \u2018La ilaha illallah,\u2019 and disbelieves in what  is  worshiped  besides  Allah,  his  property  and blood  shall  be  protected,  and  his  account  shall  be upon  Allah\u201d  (Reported  by  Muslim  from  Tariq  Ibn Ashyam). This hadith reveals that \u201cLa ilaha illallah\u201d is a word to be pronounced and that it has a meaning.Regarding this, people are divided into three categories. The first category consists of those who pronounced it and accomplished it in both meaning and application,  avoiding  its  nullifiers.  The  second  category is of those who pronounced it, outwardly acting according  to  it,  thereby  decorating  themselves  with its words, yet they inwardly succumbed to kufr and doubt.  The  third  category  is  of  those  who  spoke  it but acted against its meaning, openly falling into its nullifiers. They are \u201cthose whose effort is lost in the Dunya, while they think that they are doing well in work\u201d (Al-Kahf 104). The first category is safe, that of those of the true believers, while the second is of the munafiqin and the third is of the mushrikin.\n\u201cLa  ilaha  illallah\u201d  is  a  fortress.  But  they  erected against it the catapult of denial, casting the stones of ruin. So when the enemy entered, they took away its meaning and left its mere image. The hadith also says, \u201cIndeed, Allah does not look to your images and bodies, but rather, He looks to your hearts and deeds\u201d (Re-\nManifesting tawhid by commanding good and forbidding evil\nported by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah). They seized the meaning of \u201cLa ilaha illallah,\u201d such that all they had left was a movement of the tongue and the uttering of words. They speak of the fortress, but they are not protected thereby. Just as the mention of fire does not burn, the mention of water does not drown, the mention of bread does not satisfy one\u2019s hunger, and the mention of a sword does not cut. Likewise, the mention of the fortress does not protect. Words are the rind and the meaning is the core. Words are the shell and the meaning is the pearl. What then comes of a rind without a core or a shell without a pearl?\n\u201cLa ilaha illallah\u201d is to its meaning as the soul is to its body. The body is useless without the soul. Likewise,  this  statement  is  useless  without  its  meaning. The  people  of  merit  took  this  statement  with  both its image and its significance. They adorned their exteriors with its image \u2013 its words \u2013 and their inner selves with the meaning. As such, they were witnessed as preceding with truthfulness. \u201cAllah witnesses that there is no deity except Him, and so do the angels and those of knowledge, maintained in justice. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 18).\nThe people who equate things with Allah, i.e. those who  commit  shirk,  have  taken  this  image  without its meaning. They have adorned their exteriors with words  and  their  inner  selves  with  kufr,  believing  in what  neither  benefits  nor  causes  harm.  Their  hearts are dark and blackened.

But whether they are Muslims or merely claim to be Muslims, in both cases there is enough reason for the original inhabitants  of  the  land  from  among  the  Christians and Jews to hate them, and to endeavor to separate them from themselves, relegate them to the outskirts of the city, and avoid mixing with them and employing them in important positions of work. They prefer to leave them in this despicable condition so that they can be cheap servants for them who perform the kind of work that they themselves avoid, granting them in exchange for this humiliating condition the permission to remain in the country, as well as some wealth that barely keeps them alive and suffices their needs.Many of the residents of these suburbs accept these circumstances, which the tawaghit of the country and its native citizens conspired in in order that their situation remains as such, while others rebelled, in pursuit of a better life, equating with those who exclude them, and seeking fortune through the admiration of those who hate them. And so they did not find any avenue which would deliver them to that goal accept wealth, for it is the most important factor for measuring the value of people in that material society. Thus, the acquisition of wealth through any means possible became the goal, in pursuit of the attainment of deprived needs, and in aspiration of the fulfillment of endless desires.\nIn order to achieve this goal within the fastest time possible many of those pursue this worldly life, wandering  and  panting  behind  it,  motivated  by  the  attainment of a quick fortune, in most cases that being limited to the world of robbery and drug dealing.

Many terms emerged hovering around the concept of \u201cjust governance\u201d   and  \u201cthe ideal city,\u201d which the people dream of discovering   and  residing in, and countless wars and revolutions have  tak en  place  in various nations in order  to  a chieve  these goals. \nThe Rafidi taghut Ali Khamenei\npiness in both the worldly life and the Hereafter, they continue to differ among themselves, and there continue to appear among them misguiding leaders, each of whom claims that he is the only one who knows the path to achieving justice, and that he and his party are the only ones who are capable of establishing justice in the land. And when their opinions on justice conflict with the opinions and interests of others, there remains nothing but the weapon as a judge between them, as there is no principle they agree upon which they can refer to in order to resolve the dispute.\nThey Said, \u201cWe Are but Reformers\u201d\nThis is the condition of many of those who claim to  follow  Allah\u2019s  prophets  and  messengers  p  while having abandoned the Sunnah and treaded the path of whims and heresies, thus straying from the straight path. Every one of them followed a deviant path upon which was a shaytan calling to Hellfire, every one of them claimed to have inherited the prophetic knowledge and to be a defender of the Shari\u2019ah, and every one  of  them  gave  his  followers  hope  that  he  would return the religion to its former status as it was in the time of the prophets, and that he would even achieve for them a level of victory, consolidation, implementation of the scripture, and establishment of the religion that had not been realized for those prophets. And in the end, there emerged among them several sects.

And if they can\u2019t find anything over which to fault them, they invent for themselves guidelines and conditions for which Allah has not revealed any evidence, and then taunt AhlusSunnah for not having achieved them and for being far from reaching them.\nAnd \nincluded  among  these  guidelines  and conditions which they stipulate for the Islamic state \u2013 which they instill in the people a desire for \u2013 are matters which did not even exist in the state of the \nProphet g, and yet if any of them were to dare to defame the prophetic state or belittle its leader and imam,  no  one  would  refrain  for  even  a  moment from  making  takfir  of  them.  And  likewise  is  that with regards to the society that lives under the shade of the Shari\u2019ah and the rule of Islam, they stipulate conditions for it that did not previously exist in the society  of  the  Sahabah \uf06a.\nAnd we will attempt, in this article, to clarify \u2013 with Allah\u2019s  permission  \u2013  some  aspects  of  that  virtuous society, emphasizing its virtue and superiority over all  other  societies  of  mankind  despite  having  been afflicted with some of the same social illnesses that afflict  all  human  societies  in  every  era,  including  shahwat  (lusts)  and  shubuhat  (misconceptions).\n6ARTICLEARTICLE\n\fSome  meters  away  from  our  ribat  line,  nothing separated us from the enemy except a street on which American  B52  warplanes  \u2013  which  were  taking  off from airbases in the Arabian Peninsula \u2013 had blown a huge crater. It was a crater much like the ones that had become widespread in the various neighborhoods in Old Mosul, due to the Crusaders and their agents implementing  a  naive  strategy  in  order  to  prevent the  istishhadiyyin  from  reaching  the  murtaddin\u2019s gatherings  and  bases.  And  so  their  plotting  became their  destruction,  for  these  craters  rendered  their vehicles out of service \u2013 preventing them from moving \u2013  and  therefore,  nothing  remained  for  them  except for the warplanes to take the place of their vehicles, providing cover fire for their soldiers, and opening the path in front of them. They would burn everything in sight and turn vast areas into wastelands just so that a group overburdened with injuries could advance a few  meters.\nOn the frontline, meanwhile, the mujahidin were spread out into units and ambushing teams along its stretch between the rubble of the destroyed buildings and the trenches, with every unit containing skilled snipers, who would lie in wait for the impure Rafidah, alternating  their  sniping  missions  between  day  and night.\nIt is a difficult task that is surrounded by dangers, and one that requires constant awareness, a wakeful eye, and physical strength.\nI  approached  one  of  them,  being  drawn  towards him by his radiant face and the splint on his broken hand.  I  tried  to  start  a  conversation  with  him,  but feared  that  he  might  miss  an  opportunity  due  to me  speaking,  so  I  sat  next  to  him,  monitoring  the movements  of  the  enemy.\nA quiet moment was interrupted as the wall shook at  the  sound  of  multiple  explosions  \u2013  one  of  which was the result of a white phosphorus round that had exploded  close  to  us,  emitting  a  repulsive  smelling smoke.  I  rushed  to  pull  out  a  piece  of  cloth  I  had prepared for moments like these in order to breathe through  it.\nBut Allah c distanced the smoke from us, towards the direction of the murtaddin \u2013 praise be to Him \u2013 except that the dust of the destroyed building nearby completely obscured our vision. When the dust had cleared, that same sniper came to me with a smile on his  face  as  he  was  intending  to  relocate  to  another position, saying, \u201cWith Allah\u2019s permission, that dust will not be joined in my nose or yours, or in the noses \nof any of the mujahidin who breathed it in, together with the smoke of the fire of Jahannam, as the Prophet g said, \u2018The dust in the path of Allah and the smoke of Jahannam do not ever combine in the body of a slave\u2019\u201d (Reported by Imam al-Bukhari in al-Adab alMufrad,  and  elsewhere).  Then  he  followed  that  by saying, \u201cDo you know that this smoke was the most hateful smell in my life? But now I find it pleasant!\u201dHe  reminded  me  of  the  statement  of  Bilal  \uf068 when he was asked, \u201cHow did you endure, O Bilal?\u201d (referring to the torture of the mushrikin inflicted on him  in  the  scorching  heat  of  Makkah).  He  said,  \u201cI combined the sweetness of iman with the bitterness of the torment, and the sweetness of iman prevailed over the bitterness of the torment, and thus I endured!\u201d\nThis incident reminded me of another story of the effects of the sweetness of iman on the believer, which leads the believer to find hardship he endures for the sake of his religion to be something pleasant.\nA young man descended from one of the villages of Mosul, fatigued by a disability, the cause of which was a nerve injury in his leg which he sustained in battle. Academically he had reached the 5th grade and was from  among  those  distinguished  in  his  studies.  His father \uf08a used to dream that his son would one day become a doctor.\nWhen  Mosul  was  liberated,  his  father  joined  the ranks of the mujahidin, and he and his uncles then followed, until all his grandfather\u2019s sons had likewise joined, all of whom were killed in the path of Allah \u2013 we consider them so and Allah is their judge \u2013 the last of them being his father and uncle, who were killed on the same day in Zanjili.\nI  asked  him,  \u201cDoes  your  injury  pain  you?\u201d  He replied, \u201cWhen I press down on the protrusion I feel pain.\u201d\nI used to feel pity for him due to his circumstances, but when the battle intensified you would find him among the first of those advancing, jogging as if he were  in  good  health.  Mashaallah\u2026He  would  not remain inactive, and he would monitor the movements of the enemy and search for ideal positions from which to shoot his prey.\nAnd so, in the shade of this ruthless battle, finding a  suitable  position  became  a  difficult  goal  for  the mujahid, for it had become normal for any place from which the enemy was being shot at with bullets to be attacked with aircraft missiles \u2013 a fruitful exhaustion of the military arsenal of the Crusaders and Rafidah.

They succeeded in taking complete control of the city apart from the neighborhood of Karabilah. The neighborhood  of  Karabilah  saw  an  istishhadi  attack  on one of the locations where the remnants of the murtaddin were entrenched, and a second istishhadi attack was carried out targeting one of the Rafidi army barracks during the course of the assault. The operation resulted in more than 70 Rafidi soldiers being killed, in addition to a large number of their vehicles being destroyed. This operation came only two days after the soldiers of the Khilafah penetrated the city of Karkuk and was part of the operations to devastate the murtaddin and break their campaign against Ninawa  Wilayah.

Then He turned you back from  them  [defeated]  that  He  might  test  you\u201d  (Al \u2018Imran 152).\nIbn  Kathir  said,  \u201cTriumph  and  victory  were  for Islam at the beginning of the day, but when the disobedience of the archers took place and some of the fighting failed, the promise tied to the condition of steadfastness  and  obedience  was  delayed.\u201d\nIn this battle amazing events took place: The enemy  was  more  than  three  times  stronger  than  the Muslims.

Yet they still make the exception of their husband and their co-wife, assuming that eating their flesh is allowed and that they are immune on Yawm al-Qiyamah  to  account  and  inquisition.  And  rarely would you hear from those listening one who openly reprimands her, deters her, warns her, or reminds her. Instead, most of those listening enjoy it, their curiosity raised about the conduct and stories of these absent spouses.  In  his  book  Riyad  as-Salihin,  an-Nawawi mentioned the chapter, \u201cProhibition of Listening to Backbiting  and  the  Order  to  One Who  Hears  Forbidden Backbiting to Respond to It and Criticize Its Bearer; and If He Is Unable or His Words Are Not Accepted, Then He Should Leave that Gathering If Possible.\u201d\nAnd yet, if some of them were to only limit themselves to listening! Some women help one another and support  each  other  in  this  wrongdoing.  When  one woman complains against her husband, some of her friends react with incitement and provocation. Worse still, some women even guide their sister to the court and explain the procedure for divorce. They beautify to  her  the  termination  of  her  relationship  with  her husband, hoping to marry her off to one of their relatives or to one of their husband\u2019s relatives \u2013 not doing  anything  for  her  out  of  love  or  in  an  endeavor to fix her problem \u2013 as if they have never read what Abu Dawud reported from Abu Hurayrah, that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever embitters a women against her husband, or a slave against his owner, is not from us.\u201d\nThe  same  applies  regarding  one\u2019s  co-wife.  Many women do not refrain from speaking ill of their cowives. Instead, among them is she who would go as far as to insult her co-wife and curse her in her absence due to excessive jealousy. This happens during a meeting of women or in the presence of the husband, who often has no clue as to what he can do! Should he fight off the hostility of this sharp-tongued woman against himself or against his absent wife? Indeed, Allah\u2019s help must be sought!\nEvery Muslim woman should remember that any disparagement of her Muslim brother or sister, even with  a  mere  gesture,  is  prohibited  slander,  which  is \none of the greatest sins. It was reported that \u2018Aishah i said, \u201cO Messenger of Allah, Safiyyah is a woman\u201d and she gestured with her hand to mean that she is short. He said, \u2018You have said a word that, if ever mixed with it, would alter seawater\u201d (Narrated by Abu Dawud).\nThis was Umm al-Muminin who jokingly gestured with her hand \u2012 instead of speaking with her tongue \u2012 her disparagement of her co-wife Safiyyah i. And yet, he \uf067 warned her against her enormous act, clarifying that if this word, which none would pay attention to, were to be mixed with the water of the sea, it would alter its qualities. Further, it suffices us that he \uf067 said, \u201cThe slave says a word that displeases Allah, not giving any attention to it, until he drops with it into  Jahannam\u201d  (Narrated  by  al-Bukhari  from  Abu Hurayrah).\nThe Intelligent Person Does Not Expose the Secrets \nof His Home\nEven worse than this woman who wrongs herself is finding an otherwise intelligent man speaking about the secrets of his home to others. He exposes the secrets of his relationship with his wife, as if to remove her veil in front of other men. Indeed, this is evidence of a lack of manliness. Only one who makes a fool of himself does such a thing. Such speech should only be said to the qadi, the mufti, or a counselor who is trusted with regards to his religion and morals, and who  safeguards  the  secrets  of  those  of  his  brothers who speak to him.\nNoble  are  the  morals  of  that  tabi\u2019i  who  wanted to  divorce  his  wife,  so  he  was  asked,  \u201cWhy  do  you want to divorce her?\u201d He said: \u201cI do not speak ill of my wife\u201d. After he had divorced her, some honorable men asked him, \u201cWhy did you divorce your wife?\u201d He  said,  \u201cI  am  not  one  of  those  who  speaks  about an ajnabiyyah woman,\u201d i.e. a woman who is neither directly  related  nor  married  to  him.\nSpouses who speak about each other should know that  every  secret  of  their  home  that  is  revealed  and every ill-spoken word is akin to tears in their clothes. The more the number of holes and the larger the holes are, the more the fabric of matrimony will inevitably decay,  and  no  amount  of  patchwork  will  help  after that.\nJust as homes have a sacredness to them, they also bear  secrets  that  no  muwahhid  and  believer  should ever  expose  to  others,  even  to  his  closest  relatives. \n\f", "schema:headline": "Disavowal of the Mushrikin in the Lives of the Prophet and the Sahabah", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "25"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah2-Glad-Tidings-of-Imminent-Victory-to-the-Patient", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "2", "schema:articleBody": "Allah \uf063 created His slaves and made tribulation something constant for them, so that the pure become distinct from  the  corrupt,  and  that  those  who  perish  may  perish upon clear proof and that those who live may live upon clear proof. Thus, there will be no consolidation without trial, no victory without hardship, and no ease without difficulty.The path to Allah \uf062 and what He prepared for the believers therein of immense reward is a costly path, and these costs  cannot  be  expended  except  by  true  believers,  those whose hearts are attached to Allah alone, who are steadfast upon  the  methodology  of  the  Prophet  \uf067  and  his  noble companions. These \u2013 the true believers \u2013 are not confused by famous men and popular names. They seek the truth and recognize its people. And the people of truth are not those whose reputation in \u201cjihad\u201d circulated for decades, only to distance  themselves  therefrom,  to  deteriorate  and  regress, eventually becoming people who desert jihad and deny it. Nor are they those who spent their lives reading and writing about jihad, but when the herald called, \u201cThe Islamic State has been established, so come and follow up your knowledge with action,\u201d they turned in arrogance, as if they were hard of hearing.\nDescribing the path to the gardens of eternity, Ibnul-Qayyim \uf072 said, \u201cHow far are you from the path? It is the path upon  which  Adam  became  exhausted,  upon  which  Nuh \ncried [in prayer], upon which Ibrahim was cast into the fire, upon which Isma\u2019il was laid down for slaughter, upon which Yusuf was sold for a meager price and spent years in prison, upon which Zakariyya was sawed in half, upon which Yahya was butchered, upon which Ayyub faced harsh illness, upon which Dawud wept greatly [in fear of Allah], upon which \u2018Isa walked with wild beasts, and upon which Muhammad \uf067 faced poverty and all kinds of abuse\u201d (Al-Fawaid).\nSo if this was the condition of the Prophets \uf070, among whom were those of utmost determination, who met what they met for the sake of Allah \uf062, had patience, and were steadfast despite the great harm they endured due to their da\u2019wah to tawhid, never slackening or becoming weak, then what about those who are lesser than them? Are they not tried so that they might become pure? Are they not tested so that they might become sincere? Ash-Shafi\u2019i \uf072 was asked, \u201cWhich is best for a man, to be granted consolidation or to be tested?\u201d He said, \u201cHe will not be granted consolidation until he is tested\u201d (Al-Fawaid).\nIndeed, one who does not have a scorching beginning will not have a shining end. So there is no consolidation until the trials are intensified and the constraints are tightened, as Jannah is only promised to the truthful men and women. Therein they shall gaze upon Allah\u2019s face, which is the highest of blessings and the dearest of hopes. Could that be at-\nArticle\fJannah, the precious commodity of Allah, is the most blissful place and the ultimate aspiration, to which the believers  race  and  for  which  competitors  should  compete. Minds are unable to fathom its blessed essence. The eloquent orator is unable to describe it with words. Yet it is encircled by thorns, not roses, as the blood and severed  limbs  of  those  who  purchase  it  bear  witness,  and willingly sacrificing oneself is the highest form of generosity. \u201cBy Allah, it is not something cheap over which the morally bankrupt could haggle. Nor is it something unsought, such that the destitute could purchase it on credit. It has been presented in the market for whoever wishes to acquire it. But its Lord was not content to put a  price  on  it  other  than  the  expenditure  of  souls.  The losers  procrastinate,  while  those  who  possess  true  love stand, waiting to see which of their souls is suitable to be the payment\u201d (Ibnul-Qayyim: Zad al-Ma\u2019ad).\nIn  His  Book,  Allah  \uf062  says  something  great,  and blessed are those who read it or hear it and reflect over it  and  consider  its  meaning,  that,  \u201cIf  some  wound  afflicts you, then [know that] a similar wound has already afflicted  the  enemy.  Such  are  days  [of  war],  which  we alternate  between  the  people,  so  that  Allah  shall  make known those who believe and shall take from amongst them shuhada; and Allah does not like the tyrants. And so that Allah shall test those who believe and shall crush the disbelievers. Or did you think that you would enter Jannah, while Allah has yet to have made known those of you who waged jihad and those who were patient?\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 140-142). It is the perfect, divine management of affairs, a wound for a wound, a state for a state, and the believers, some of them are shuhada, and all of them are tested in order to be distinguished, and thus the pure rise above the foul. As for Jannah, it is the reward for those who pass the test and have patience during the trials, remaining steadfast upon hardship, neither panicking nor becoming resentful, never implying by their actions that, \u201cAllah and His Messenger promised us nothing but delusion\u201d (Al-Ahzab 12). How far the sick-hearted are from ever reaching and enjoying the gardens of their Lord!\nThe muwahhidah must not assume that she is exempt from such tests and trials. Rather, the woman and the man \u2013 regarding this \u2013 are similar. She could play a major role in keeping her husband and children steadfast. Such was the case of Khadijah and Asma, and of Sumayyah and al-Khansa, as well as many others whose virtues are too numerous to mention here. As for Khadijah, she is the Mother of the Believers and the one whose heart was the first to throb with iman in the prophetic message. She was one of those by whom Allah firmly established this  religion  through  her  support  of  her  husband,  the Final Messenger, Muhammad \uf067.\n\u2018Aishah  \uf069  narrated  that  the  Prophet  \uf067,  after  first receiving revelation at Hira Cave, became alarmed and went to his wife, Khadijah, telling her what happened, saying, \u201cI have become worried for myself.\u201d So Khadijah said to him, \u201cDo nothing, but rejoice! For by Allah, He will never disgrace you. By Allah, you keep ties of kinship, you speak the truth, you bear burdens for orphans and widows, you gain virtue by helping the destitute, you are \nhospitable to guests, and you help people through their afflictions\u201d  (Reported  by  al-Bukhari  and  Muslim).  So when the Mother of the Believers Khadijah \uf069 heard the astounding news from her husband, she did not despair or become terrified. She did not grab onto her husband for fear of the days to come. And she did not dishearten him, but rather emboldened him. On this, an-Nawawi said,  \u201cScholars  have  said  that  these  words  of  Khadijah \uf069  are  the  greatest  evidence  and  most  profound  proof of the merit of Khadijah, the excellence of her counsel, the strength of her soul, the firmness of her heart, and the magnitude of her comprehension. And Allah knows best\u201d (Sharh Sahih Muslim).\nDays passed and the da\u2019wah spread, as did the oppression of the tawaghit of Quraysh against the muwahhidin. They besieged them in the mountain pass belonging to Abu Talib and banned them from food and water. But the Mother of the Believers was steadfast alongside her husband \uf067. She was patient and perseverant, while the afflictions of hunger and thirst hit her as it hit the rest of the people with them. She was who she was, a person of great heritage and lineage, and of wealth and esteem. She stayed there in the pass of Abu Talib for two years, hurt by starvation and fatigue, until she died in her state of patience, firmly upon her religion, while her husband was pleased with her; may Allah be pleased with her.\nAs for Sumayyah, Bint Khayyat, the mother of \u2018Ammar  Ibn Yasir,  then  she  was  the  seventh  person  to  accept Islam and the first person to attain shahadah, thus quenching  the  tree  of  tawhid  with  her  blood.  Yes,  O Muslimah, the first blood to be shed for the cause of \u201cla ilaha illallah\u201d was the blood of a woman. Sumayyah, her husband, and her son were mawali (freed slaves) of the Makhzum  clan  of  Quraysh.  And  when  they  embraced Islam, they were met with all kinds of torture. Jabir \uf068 narrated  that  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  \uf067  passed  by  \u2018Ammar and his family while they were being tortured, so he said, \u201cGlad tidings, O family of \u2018Ammar, O family of Yasir, for verily your destination is Jannah\u201d (Reported by ad-Diya and  al-Hakim).\nSumayyah  \uf069  was  not  tortured  except  for  the  sake of Allah, in order to push her to leave her religion, the path of the Prophet \uf067, who did not bring wealth, gold, or silver, but only a \u201cnew\u201d religion, not followed by the forefathers of the Arab pagans. He gave them a word, to bear witness to and abide by, so that Jannah would be theirs.  And  despite  the  severe  torture,  and  despite  Sumayyah being a weak, oppressed woman, she remained firm and did not abandon faith or go back on what she believed and that by which she worshiped her Lord. Ibn Ishaq said, \u201cSome men from the family of \u2018Ammar Ibn Yasir  told  me  that  Sumayyah,  the  mother  of  \u2018Ammar, was tortured by the family of al-Mughirah [Ibn \u2018Abdillah al-Makhzumi] due to her Islam, and she refused to reject Islam until they killed her\u201d (As-Sirah). So her end was that of shahadah, after she was patient and steadfast, when the enemy of Allah \u2013 Abu Jahl (Ibn Hisham Ibn al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi) \u2013 pierced her with a spear, killing her.\nAs  for  Asma,  she  was  the  daughter  of  Abu  Bakr \n\f", "schema:headline": "Glad Tidings of Imminent Victory to the Patient", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "25"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5-Traits-of-the-Evil-Scholars", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "5", "schema:articleBody": "In  a  previous  article  titled  \u201cThe  Wicked  Scholars  Are Cursed,\u201d1 we clarified the correct meaning of \u201cscholars\u201d and mentioned the most important traits by which they became imams in the religion. It is clear by the shar\u2019i texts that the \u201cscholars\u201d of evil and deviance can never be counted among the scholars no matter how much they memorize and pen and no matter how famous they become. Rather, they are more similar to the Jews, who had knowledge, but concealed what they knew, did not act by it, and even called others to deviance. And because of the numerous \u201cscholars\u201d of evil in our era who have persisted in calling to misguidance, it is necessary to mention their ugly traits until the people are heedful of their danger.\nConcealing the Truth\nIndeed, among the purposes of knowledge is to convey it and make it clear to the people, as their guidance and interests  are  linked  to  it.  By  contrast,  concealing  it  and  not manifesting it are from the greatest of forbidden matters and severest of destructive sins. Thus, Allah has taken a covenant \n1   See Rumiyah, issue 1.\n26Article\nfrom every individual whom He gave knowledge, ordering that he convey it and not conceal what people need from it. Allah \uf063 said, \u201c[Mention], when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture, [saying], \u2018You must make it clear to the people and not conceal it.\u2019 But they threw it away behind their backs and exchanged it for a small price. And wretched is that which they purchased\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 187).As such, the evil \u201cscholar\u201d is a traitor to Allah\u2019s religion, a denier of the blessing of knowledge, and a cause for the people\u2019s deviance. Thus, Allah decreed that he be cursed and placed the people\u2019s curse upon him, due to his endeavor to cheat mankind by concealing the truth from them. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cIndeed, those who conceal what We sent down of clear proofs and guidance after We made it clear for the people in the Scripture \u2013 those are cursed by Allah and cursed by those who curse\u201d (Al-Baqarah 159).\nIndeed, the greatest matter which the evil \u201cscholars\u201d have concealed from the people is the condition of the tawaghit and the ruling of Allah on them, as Allah has commanded us to abandon the tawaghit and disbelieve in them, and has made this from the basis of tawhid and iman. However, when the  people  saw  their  prominent  \u201cscholars\u201d  compromising with the taghut rulers and being silent about their shirk and \nArticle\fThe river island from which it is said the Murabitin set forth \nsake of da\u2019wah. However, the Shaykh of Kadalah advised him to stay in a famous school near the Senegal River. Ibn Khaldun said, \u201cThey isolated themselves from the people at a hill near a river basin, one which is shallow in the summer and abundant in the winter, causing the appearance of various islands. They entered the forests on the islands and secluded themselves for worship\u201d (Tarikh Ibn Khaldun).\nFrom Da\u2019wah to Jihad\nAllah  willed  that  this  caller  to  Islam  would  be  a  good seed from which an Islamic emirate would grow. Ibn Khaldun said, \u201cAll those who had a grain\u2019s weight of good in their hearts began speaking about them. People began coming to them and entering into their religion and their forest home. Once their number reached a thousand men, their shaykh, \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin, said to them, \u2018A thousand will not be defeated due to small numbers, and establishing the truth, calling to it, and holding everyone to account for it has become obligatory on each of us. So let us go forth for this cause.\u2019 They then went out and killed whoever opposed them from the Lamtunah and Kadalah tribes.\u201d Ibn Yasin thus went forth as a mujahid for Allah\u2019s cause, fighting against the apostate tribes forcefully resisting the Shari\u2019ah.\nIbnul-Athir related this, saying, \u201cIbn Yasin then said to those who obeyed him, \u2018It is obligatory upon you to fight those who opposed the truth, denied the Shari\u2019ah of Islam, and prepared to fight you. So raise for yourselves a banner, and put forward an amir to lead you.\u2019\u201d And with that small believing group, the Murabitin subdued the desert to the rule of Allah \uf063. As-Salawi said, \u201cHe began raiding the different tribes until he conquered all of the lands of the Sahara and crushed its tribes\u2026 His authority became known in all of the lands of the Sahara and, from those that neighbored it, of the Sudan, the Kabyle, the Masmuda, and the rest of the Maghrib, and [the news spread] that there arose a man in Kadalah, calling to Allah \uf063 and to the straight path, and ruling by what Allah had revealed, and that he was humble \nand  had  zuhd  towards  the  Dunya.  His  reputation  soared throughout the lands, and his impression made its way into the people\u2019s hearts until they loved him.\u201d Just as he sought to please Allah by displeasing the people at the beginning of his mission, Allah caused the people to be pleased with him thereafter. They loved him and entered under his obedience.\nRuling by the Shari\u2019ah\nWhen  the  Shaykh  of  Kadalah  passed  away,  Ibn  Yasin presented the leader of the Lamtunah tribe to take over as the military leader. As-Salawi said, \u201c\u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin gathered  the  heads  of  the  Sanhaja  tribes  and  appointed Yahya Ibn \u2018Umar al-Lamtuni over them, while \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin was the amir\u2026 Yahya Ibn \u2018Umar was tasked with managing the affairs of war, while \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin oversaw affairs pertaining to religion, ruling by the Shari\u2019ah, and collecting zakah and jizyah.\u201d\nThe Murabitin continued, behind their new military amir and under the direction of their faqih, \u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin, to renew the religion for the people.\nIn the year 446AH, as al-Bakri mentions, Ibn Yasin raided Aoudaghost (in southern Mauritania today), which was the seat of the King of Ghana before he entered into Islam. Al-Bakri said, \u201c\u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin killed a man there, who was from the mixed Arabs of Kairouan and who was known for  piety,  righteousness,  Quran  recitation,  and  performing Hajj, and his name was Zabaqirah. The reason the Murabitin attacked them was because these mixed Arabs backed the authority and rule of the [pagan] leader of Ghana\u201d (Al-Masalik wal-Mamalik).\nIn  the  year  447AH,  the  Murabitin  entered  Sijilmasa (in southern Morocco today), and stopped all wrongdoing therein. As-Salawi said, \u201c[\u2018Abdullah Ibn Yasin] changed whatever vices he found therein. He destroyed flutes and musical instruments. He burned taverns in which wines were sold. He annulled taxes and toppled the taxing offices. He effaced whatever the Book and the Sunnah obligated to be effaced. \n\f", "schema:headline": "Traits of the Evil Scholars", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "25"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq3", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3-Towards-the-Major-Malhamah-of-Dabiq", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "3", "schema:articleBody": "During the Battle of Ahzab, the believers were afflicted by the sick-hearted and the scaremongers in Madinah, the people\u2019s eyes shifted in fear and their hearts reached their throats, and various assumptions were made about Allah. He \uf063  said,  \u201cAnd  you  assumed  about  Allah  [various]  assumptions\u201d (Al-Ahzab 10). At-Tabari and Ibn Abi Hatim reported  that  al-Hasan  al-Basri  \uf072  commented  on  this verse,  saying,  \u201cThe  munafiqin  thought  that  Muhammad and his companions would be eradicated, and the believers had conviction that what Allah had promised them was true \u2013 that He would make Islam overpower all religions even if the mushrikin despised such.\u201d The munafiqin and the sick-hearted then said, \u201cAllah and His Messenger did not promise us except delusion\u201d (Al-Ahzab 12). At-Tabari and Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Qatadah \uf072 commented on this verse, saying, \u201cSome of the munafiqin said, \u2018Muhammad used to promise us that we would conquer Persia and Rome, but we\u2019ve been besieged here and now none of us is able to go out to relieve his bowels. Allah and His Messenger did not promise us except delusion.\u2019\u201d\nThen \u2013 in the midst of harsh war and severe affliction \u2013 the believers realized that Allah\u2019s support was near. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cWhen the believers saw the [war] parties, they said, \u2018This is what Allah and His Messenger had promised us, \nand Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth.\u2019 And it increased them only in faith and submission\u201d (Al-Ahzab 22). At-Tabari reported that Ibn \u2018Abbas \uf06b commented on this verse, saying, \u201cAllah had said to them in Surat al-Baqarah, \u2018Do you think that you will enter Jannah while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken, until [their] messenger and those who believed with him said, \u2018When is the support of Allah?\u2019 Indeed, the support of Allah is near\u2019 (Al-Baqarah 214). So when calamity befell them as they were in the trench performing ribat against the war parties, the believers applied the verse to their situation, and it did not increase them except in faith and submission.\u201d\nThus, the believers, in their trenches, remember the ayat of Allah \uf065 and the ahadith of the Messenger \uf067, interpret what they contain of news and signs, and apply them to their tribulations. Hardships and calamities do not distance them from contemplating the ayat of Allah and the wisdom of the Messenger \uf067. Rather, the hardships and calamities increase the believers \u2013 during their effort and battle \u2013 in patience against tribulation, contentment with Allah\u2019s decree, and certainty of the actualization of what Allah and His Messenger \uf067 have promised them, whereas the mu-\n24Article\nArticle\fScholars of the tawaghit\nto not ask about the isnad, but when the fitnah arose, they would say, \u2018Name your men for us!\u2019 So they would take hadith from people of Sunnah and would not take hadith from people of bid\u2019ah.\u201d\nAn example of this is Shababah Ibn Sawwar al-Fazari (d. 206AH). When he adopted some of the bid\u2019ah of irja, Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal \uf072 abandoned taking knowledge from him and said, \u201cI did not write from him due to his irja\u201d (Al-Mizzi: Tahdhib al-Kamal).4\nThis indicates that there were those amongst the people of bid\u2019ah who bore knowledge, preserved it, and excelled in many fields thereof, yet despite so, the imams of the Sunnah were not deceived by them. Rather, the imams avoided the mubtadi\u2019ah, as such knowledge was not a commendation for  them,  but  a  proof  against  them.  Knowledge  necessitates fear of Allah and good deeds, as Ibrahim an-Nakha\u2019i \uf072 said, \u201cWhenever we wanted to take knowledge from a shaykh, we would ask him about his food, drink, and where he would spend his time. If he was upright, we would take from him. Otherwise, we would not go to him\u201d (Ibn \u2018Adiyy: Al-Kamil fi Du\u2019afa ar-Rijal).\nRather, the Salaf would not shy away from mentioning, by name, those who made mistakes when narrating, wheth-\n4   Though Shababah al-Fazari was involved in the bid\u2019ah of irja and even called to it, he did not hold the extreme views of later Murji\u2019ah. He  is  even  quoted  as  saying,  \u201cMy  opinion  and  that  of  Abun-Nadr Hashim Ibn al-Qasim and a group of the fuqaha is that Bishr al-Marisi is a kafir. If he does not repent, his neck should be struck\u201d (Al-Lalikai: Sharh as-Sunnah). On top of this, he was a truthful and trustworthy narrator of hadith, having narrations in both Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. Imam Ahmad abandoned him as a disciplinary measure for Shababah and a precautionary measure for himself, as a person\u2019s bid\u2019ah could possibly emerge in conversation and thereafter settle in the heart forever. Finally, it is reported from Abu Zur\u2019ah that Shababah repented from irja (Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi: Tarikh Baghdad), and Allah knows best.\ner due to poor memory or imprecision, even if they were people of virtue and uprightness, and this was in order to warn people of their mistakes. This is not prohibited ghibah (backbiting); it is obligatory, sincere advice. This is so that these mistakes are not wrongly attributed to the Shari\u2019ah. Otherwise, people might assume the mistakes are from the religion and thus follow them. As a result, Islamic history bore witness to the emergence of a magnificent science called \u201cal-Jarh wat-Ta\u2019dil,\u201d5 which was one of the greatest sources of pride for the Ummah, and through it, the Sunnah was preserved by distinguishing the authentic reports from the weak ones.\nAl-Jarh wat-Ta\u2019dil is one of the sciences of hadith. In it, the conditions of narrators \u2013 those who transmit knowledge \u2013 are researched in regards to their uprightness, precision, truthfulness, and trustworthiness. Thus, the scholars of this field would mention the narrator based on what was known of him being weak, being deceptive, making mistakes, or telling lies. These scholars even dedicated compilations to such  \u201cmajruhin\u201d  (those  with  whom  faults  were  found). Al-Bukhari  and  Abu  Ja\u2019far  al-\u2018Uqayli  (d.  322AH)  compiled books they entitled \u201cAd-Du\u2019afa,\u201d meaning \u201cthe weak ones.\u201d  An-Nasai  (d.  303AH),  ad-Daraqutni  (d.  385AH), and Ibnul-Jawzi (d. 597AH) compiled books they entitled \u201cAd-Du\u2019afa  wal-Matrukun,\u201d  meaning  \u201cthe  weak  and  the abandoned.\u201d Ibn \u2018Adiyy al-Jurjani (d. 365AH) compiled his book \u201cAl-Kamil fi Du\u2019afa ar-Rijal,\u201d meaning \u201cthe complete collection  of  weak  men.\u201d  Other  scholars  likewise  wrote many famous and important compilations in this field.\nIn this regards, \u2018Abdullah Ibn \u2018Ahmad Ibn Hanbal \uf074 said, \u201cAbu Turab an-Nakhshabi came to my father as my father was saying, \u2018So-and-so is weak. So-and-so is trust-\n5   \u201cJarh wat-Ta\u2019dil,\u201d meaning, \u201cwounding and declaring upright,\u201d is  the  science  of  determining  the  trustworthiness  of  narrators  by searching for their faults and their positive traits.\n\f", "schema:headline": "Towards the Major Malhamah of Dabiq", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "23"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah13-The-Position-of-Imamah-in-the-Religion", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "13", "schema:articleBody": "ARTICLE\n\fO mujahidin!

Allah \uf062 addressed them from above the seven heavens, giving divine advice and teaching distinct etiquette, none of which requires further interpretation or explanation for  those  whom  Allah  has  granted  insight.  From  these lessons is one coming in the form of an order in His saying, \u201cAbide in your homes\u201d (Al-Ahzab 33), meaning stay, be settled, and remain at home. Since it is Allah \uf066 who commanded this, the believing men and women have no choice but to say, \u201cWe hear and we obey.\u201d Why then do most women today not stay in their homes as the best of them had been ordered, but instead so often leave for no true need or necessity? This is a weakness in their religious capacity for adhering to these kinds of teachings, as doing so goes against the pleasures claimed in leaving one\u2019s home for the tempting, beautiful world.\nSome might say that this order of remaining home is specific to the wives of the Prophet \uf067 and thus other women are not included therein. Al-Qurtubi answers this  by  saying,  \u201cThe  meaning  of  this  ayah  is  the  command  to  stay  at  home.

Allah \uf063 is kind and merciful to His slaves and did not forbid a woman from leaving her  home  absolutely.  Rather,  He  only  made  staying home the default rule. As for her leaving home, then such is based upon need. This need is evaluated by the woman  after  her  husband,  father,  or  guardian.

The  hudud  of  Allah are  carried  out  on those  deserving  of them,  and  the  circumstances  did  not stop the call to good, and  ordering  it  and forbidding  evil.  This is how Islam is established  in  its  totality  as  Allah  c  ordered.\nThe murtaddin\u2019s claims that they would rule by the Shari\u2019ah were mere lies\nSo the fighter on the frontlines remains firm in his place only to defend the land that is governed by Allah\u2019s shari\u2019ah from the mushrikin, and he knows with certainty  that  his  victory  over  his  enemy  is  not  due to the strength of his arms, nor to the accuracy of his weapon or the extent of his equipment. Rather it is the sheer grace of Allah upon him. And the more he is certain that the religion is being established as Allah has willed, the more he increases in certainty of Allah\u2019s victory for him over his enemy. And so he establishes the religion on the axis that the imam designated him with, by waging jihad against the mushrikin and defending the Muslim lands.\nHis brothers behind him are a company to which he falls back and a means of support. They protect the Muslims\u2019 honor and wealth, and nothing keeps them away from the battle fronts and the outposts of ribat except their obedience to those in authority over them and that which they fulfill of the responsibility placed on their shoulders \u2013 the responsibility of establishing the religion, whose rites would not be honored, whose hudud  would  not  be  preserved,  and  whose  rulings would not be implemented without them. So if they are called to mobilize, they mobilize, if their support is sought, they support, and if they are ordered, they obey.\nThis is how the situation continues to proceed in every part of Dar al-Islam. The soldiers of the Islamic State establish the religion therein as long as the blessing of empowerment continues, so that if Allah afflicts them through their enemy and they are forced to fall \nback and regroup with the main company \u2013 with the permission of their leaders \u2013 after sacrificing greatly in repelling the mushrikin from it, they become free of blame before Allah, and go back to exerting every effort in order to regain control over the territory they withdrew  from  and  establish  the  Shari\u2019ah  therein. Through that, the truthfulness of their call and their loyalty  to  their  pledge  is  confirmed,  such  that  they please their Lord and demonstrate the correctness of their  manhaj.\nAl-Bukhari reports from Anas that the Prophet g said, \u201cIf the Hour is established and in the hand of one of you is a date palm seedling and he is able to finish planting it, then he should plant it\u201d (Al-Adab al-Mufrad).\nTherefore, O soldiers of Islam and defenders of the Shari\u2019ah,  let  not  one  of  you  disdain  any  manner  of good deed, and let him not become incompetent in establishing any rite from the rites of Islam that he is capable of establishing, or calling to any of the recommended deeds, even if he is occupied with repelling the enemy, defending the lands, or guarding an outpost.\nAnd  beware  of  delaying  the  establishment  of  the religion in its entirety after Allah has established you in the land even for a day or part of a day. And beware of undoing any of the religion\u2019s rites and rulings in the territory you control for so much as a day or part of a day, for you will anger your Lord and assist your enemy against yourselves. Allah says, \u201cSo whoever does an atom\u2019s weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom\u2019s weight of evil will see it\u201d (Az-Zalzalah 7-8).\n\f", "schema:headline": "Contents", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "1"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah11", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq2", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah11-Important-Advice-for-the-Mujahidin:-Part-1", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "6ARTICLE\nARTICLE\fMy beloved sisters with whom I am on a journey to Allah, let us purify our intentions and rectify our deeds, as it seems that ahead of us await times of intense trials and extreme hardships, and times of severe battles between iman and kufr, after which will be ease inshaallah, as Allah \uf063 has promised us in His statement, \u201cFor verily along with hardship is relief. Verily along with hardship is relief\u201d (Ash-Sharh 5-6),  and in His statement, \u201cAnd [that] indeed, Our soldiers would be the victors\u201d (As-Saffat 173).\nSo  the  question  is,  are  we  prepared  for  it?  Are our  souls  ready  to  make  sacrifices  for  the  sake  of Allah?  Are  our  hearts  empty  of  everything  except iman? Are we able to continue upon this path? Are we able to remain firm and steadfast and say as the Sahabah  \uf073  said  after  the  Battle  of  Uhud:  \u201cThose unto whom the people said, \u2018Verily the people have gathered  against  you.  Therefore  fear  them.\u2019  But  it only increased them in faith, and they said, \u2018Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs\u2019\u201d  (Al  \u2018Imran  173).\nMay Allah shower His mercy upon all of you and may these words be beneficial and a turning point for us all towards what is best.\nThis  was  due  to  their  iman  in  Allah  and  His Messenger, their certainty in Allah and His aid, and their trust and handing over of their affairs to Him. It was due to their sincerity towards Allah and His Messenger. Was there anything left that they did not give up in order to seek the pleasure of Allah? There were no thorny paths that they could have treaded for the sake of Allah except that they treaded them willingly. There was no better way of showing their loyalty to Allah and His Messenger than cutting the heads of their mushrik relatives and so they did it. Their claim of loving Allah and His Messenger more than  anything  else  was  truly  illustrated  through their  iman,  their  taqwa,  their  sacrifices,  and  their ambitions. It was demonstrated by what their concerns were. And their yearning to Allah made it clear that they desired the Hereafter only. May Allah \uf063 be pleased with them all and grant us of strength, iman, and taqwa the like of what they were blessed with so that we can attain the likes of the rewards they  attained.\nMy beloved sisters, our roles and responsibilities have not come to an end. Rather, they have increased and have become of greater importance. It is time to  reform  ourselves,  to  wake  up  from  the  slumber of heedlessness to the reality of our objectives. It is \ntime to examine our duties and roles, and prioritize our concerns for the Hereafter, not the Dunya. We Muslim women are required to fulfill our duties attentively, and being negligent of them will only lead to our own destruction. Our mission is greater than we can imagine. Allah has honored us by choosing us to be the wives, sisters, and mothers of the mujahidin, so does it befit us to be busied by the lowly materialistic life as many of us have unfortunately become? The time to prepare ourselves is limited, so we must dust off the dirt of laziness and break the shackles of the Dunya. Did we not already leave the best that the world could offer us a long time ago? Did we not leave the most beloved ones to us behind when we took our first steps on our hijrah? So why it is that after having purified our hearts of the Dunya some  of  us  are  caught  up  in  the  traps  of  shaytan, with our hearts being contaminated and becoming attached to the Dunya once more by making foods, drinks, gossip, slander, idle speech, and materialistic objects our main concern? How sad is it that we are witnessing sisters chasing after the Dunya here instead of making their priority the support of their mujahid husbands and the raising of their children to emulate the likes of Khalid Ibn Walid and \u2018Abdullah Ibn az-Zubayr.\nAllah  \uf063  says  \u201cYou  are  the  best  nation  brought forth  for  the  people.  You  enjoin  right  and  forbid wrong, and you believe in Allah\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 110). Yet, how many sisters have returned to Dar al-Harb after refusing to remarry for the sake of Allah due to their extreme love of their husband who had attained  shahadah  inshaallah,  even  though  on  the Day of Judgment everyone\u2019s cry will be \u201cMyself, myself,\u201d and neither will a woman be concerned about her husband, nor will a man be concerned about his wife.  Why  are  we  allowing  our  desires  to  control our actions? Do we not contemplate on the ayah in which Allah \uf063 says, \u201cHave you seen him who takes his own desires as his god?\u201d (Al-Jathiyah 23). How many of us here without maharim are not obeying those who\u2019ve been designated to be responsible over us, whereas Allah commands us to do so, saying, \u201cO you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those of you who are in authority\u201d (An-Nisa 59).\nAnd how many of us are making life difficult for our  husbands  because  they  intend  to  practice  the sunnah of polygamy in which there are many benefits for the Ummah, while Allah  \uf063 says, \u201cO you \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Important Advice for the Mujahidin: Part 1", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "5"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah12-Rulings-Related-to-Giving-Da\u2019wah-to-the-Harbi-Kuffar", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "12", "schema:articleBody": "18ARTICLEARTICLE\n\fO  mujahidin!  I  do  not  find  anything  better than that which was written by Shaykhul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah,  while  commenting  on  the  mobilization of the Ahzab in the Battle of the Trench. He r said, \u201cAnd the summary of the story \u2013 i.e. the Battle of the Trench \u2013 is that the Muslims [faced] the collectivity of the mushrikin mobilizing against them from around them and they came with their armies to Madinah in order to eradicate the believers. So Quraysh and their allies from Bani Asad, Ashja\u2019, Fazazah and others from the tribes of Najd gathered, and likewise did the Jews of Quraydah and an-Nadhir gather. Thus did these Ahzab  gather  and  they  outnumbered  the  Muslims many times. So the Prophet g raised the women and children to the elevated parts of Madinah.\n\u201cAnd in this occurrence \u2013 i.e. the one in the time of Shaykhul-Islam \u2013 the enemy, Mongols and other Turks,  Persians,  Arabized  Arabs,  and  their  likes from  among  the  apostates,  including  the  Armenian Christians and others have mobilized. And this enemy came down next to the lands of the Muslims while they are between bravery and reluctance to fight, with the Muslims opposing them being few in number, and the Mongols\u2019 aim being to seize the land to exterminate its  people,  just  as  those  ones  previously  came  down in the surroundings of Madinah against the Muslims. And during the year of the Trench there was a strong coldness and a harsh wind, by which Allah turned the Ahzab away from Madinah, as He c said, \u2018And We sent upon them a wind and armies [of angels] you did not see\u2019 (Al-Ahzab 9).\n\u201cAnd  likewise,  this  year,  Allah  multiplied  in  it the snow, rain, and cold, in contradiction to what is common, until most people disliked that and we used to tell them, \u2018Do not dislike that, for indeed in this lies a wisdom and mercy from Allah.\u2019 And this was from the greatest means by which Allah turned away the  enemy.\n\u201cAnd  Allah  said  about  the  matter  of  the  Ahzab, \u2018[Remember] when they came at you from above you and from below you, and when eyes shifted [in fear], and hearts reached the throats and you assumed about Allah [various] assumptions. There the believers were tested and shaken with a severe shaking\u2019 (Al-Ahzab 10-11).\n\u201cAnd  likewise  this  year,  the  enemy  came  from the  upper  part  of  Sham...which  is  north  of  the Euphrates\u2026\u201d\nHe then continues until he says, \u201cAnd the people assumed about Allah various assumptions. This one \nthought that no one from the army of Sham would stand  and  face  them  and  they  would  eradicate  the people  of  Sham,  and  this  one  thought  that  if  they confronted  them,  [the  Mongols]  would  annihilate them  and  surround  them  just  like  the  moon  is surrounded by a glow, and this one thought that they could no longer reside in the land of Sham and that it would no longer be a land of Islam, and this one thought that they would take it (i.e. Sham) and then proceed to Misr (Egypt) and then conquer it and no one  would  stand  in  their  way,  so  he  contemplated fleeing to Yemen and other such places, and this one \u2013  thinking  somewhat  positively  \u2013  said,  \u2018They  will rule [Sham] this year as they ruled it in the year of Hulagu  in  657  AH.  Then  the  army  may  come  out from  Misr  and  rescue  it  from  them  just  as  it  came out that year.\u2019 And this is the assumption of the best among  them.  And  this  one  that  what  the  scholars of  the  prophet  narrations  informed  him  of,  along with  the  glad  tidings,  were  merely  false  hopes  and absurd  superstitions,  and  this  one  was  overcome  by fear  and  panic,  to  the  extent  that  thoughts  would enter his heart, coming and going as quickly as the passing of the clouds, as he had no mind with which to comprehend and no tongue with which to speak. And  for  this  one,  the  signs  contradicted  themselves and his desires conflicted with one another, especially because he could not distinguish with regards to the glad tidings between those which are true and those which are false, nor could he distinguish with regards to the scholars of narrations between those who were mistaken and those who were correct, nor does he know the texts of the narrations as the scholars do. Rather, he is either ignorant of them and has only heard them as  parables,  following  which  he  could  not  discern the subtle clues they contain, or even lead himself to refute  what  he  thought  contradicted  them  upon  his initial glance. For this reason, confusion took hold of him who was characterized as being guided, and the various opinions would pelt one another with him just as children pelt one another with stones. \u2018There the believers were tested and shaken with a severe shaking\u2019 (Al-Ahzab  111).  Allah  tested  them  with  this  trial, through  which  He  atones  their  mistakes  and  raises their ranks, and then He c said, \u2018And when a faction of them said, \u2018O people of Yathrib, there is no place for you [here], so return [home]\u2019\u2019 (Al-Ahzab 13).\n\u201cSo a faction of them said, \u2018There is no place for you to take up position here due to the large numbers of the enemy, so return to Madinah.\u2019 And it was said \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Rulings Related to Giving Da\u2019wah to the Harbi Kuffar", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "17"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah7-Only-Those-of-His-Slaves-with-Knowledge-Fear-Allah", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "Article\n\ftions that take people out of Islam, so many people think they are still Muslims, while in reality they have fallen into kufr and riddah.\nMany  people  think  Islam  is  like  a  citizenship  \u2013 once you get it, it remains with you until the end of your life. But Islam doesn\u2019t work with the same principle.  It  has  conditions  by  which  one  enters  it  and nullifiers by which can leave it \u2013 even without knowing it. Just as wudu, salah, and fasting can be broken by certain actions, so too can one\u2019s Islam be broken, and nothing restores it except sincere repentance. It is the responsibility of every Muslim to protect himself and others from kufr, so it is necessary to know about those actions which lead to it.\nThe  nullifiers  of  Islam  that  deal  with  democracy and man-made laws are those least mentioned. Participating in government elections and voting in them, as well as military service, working as a lawyer, and criticizing the Shari\u2019ah of Allah, are only a few of the many things which can nullify one\u2019s Islam, and all of them are easy to perpetrate when living in Dar al-Kufr. The kufr of these actions is rarely explained to the Muslims, nor are they warned about it; in fact, they are often even incited to commit them by the many evil scholars, the imams of kufr and their followers!\nThe reason for this ignorance is the lack of study of the religion among individuals. Though most of the blame for this negligence could just as easily fall upon the imams, the \u201cscholars,\u201d and the lecturers. Instead of  warning  about  shirk  and  kufr,  they  belittle  their importance,  possibly  even  recommending  that  one commits  kufr  for  the  sake  of  some  passing  worldly benefit or for the sake of \u201ctolerance.\u201d They hold firmly to what they have learned at Murjiah-run schools in the Arab world and elsewhere, teaching \u2013 in practicality \u2013 that no Muslim can truly fall into kufr, as they criticize anyone who declares the riddah of a claimant to Islam for his commission of shirk or another act of blatant kufr.\nHowever, Allah \uf063 has promised in His Book that even if the Muslims were to abandon their religion, they would be replaced by those who would remain faithful to Him and to His limits. He said, \u201cO you who believe! Whoever of you should revert from his religion, Allah will bring forth a people He will love and who will love Him, who are humble toward the believers, powerful against the disbelievers; they strive in the cause of Allah and do not fear the blame of any blamer. That is the favor of Allah, which He bestows upon whom He wills, and Allah is Encompassing and \nKnowing\u201d (Al-Maidah 54).\nPerhaps  the  fulfillment  of  this  ayah  in  our  time came  only  recently.  As  the  masses  of  \u201cMuslims\u201d  in the world have been falling day by day into kufr and riddah, into accepting only an Irja-based creed, and rejecting the clarity of the Quran and the Sunnah, it was only a matter of time that Allah would replace them  with  true  Muslims  who  applied  the  Shari\u2019ah, rejecting kufr and guarding themselves from riddah, without  appeasing  anyone  who  criticized  them  for doing  so.  The  Islamic  State  rose  from  sincerity  and was nourished by the blood of shuhada who took the fight against kufr seriously, striking at it until they met their Lord in that condition, striving in His cause.\nAnd  by  the  grace  of  Allah,  the  Islamic  State  has continued  to  have  a  firm  policy  against  kufr  and riddah. It hasn\u2019t hesitated to make takfir despite the blame  of  any  critcs.  This  is  because  it  didn\u2019t  come about to please the people, but rather, to please the Lord of creation. Thus, when the Messenger of Allah \uf067 ordered to kill anyone who leaves Islam, the Islamic State listened and obeyed, as \u201cIt is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger  have  decided  a  matter,  that  they  should have any choice in their affair\u201d (Al-Ahzab 36).\nWhen the kafir media began spreading the news about the mass executions conducted by the Islamic State in Iraq and Sham, many foolish people accused it  of  being  of  the  \u201cKhawarij.\u201d  And  when  it  burned Muath al-Kasasbeh, it was called an \u201cun-Islamic extremist organization.\u201d As many of the so-called \u201cMuslim\u201d world protested and disavowed themselves from these actions, no one brought up the kufr and riddah of which these who were executed and burned were guilty! And how could they, for they themselves didn\u2019t know what the nullifiers of Islam were or what they included.\nThere is not a single enemy which the Islamic State is fighting that is free of kufr. Those factions that it wages war against have committed at least one nullifier \u2013 and most have committed more than one \u2013 which is usually their supporting the kuffar against the Muslims, as well as their endeavor to replace the law of Allah  with  man-made  legislation.  And  even  though this fact has been brought out several times, it doesn\u2019t benefit the Muslims unless they know that these actions are, in fact, riddah and kufr. For this reason, the ignorant \u201cMuslims\u201d are blaming the Islamic State for spreading fitnah and \u201cspoiling the jihad,\u201d though the only true jihad for Allah\u2019s cause is what the Islamic \n\f", "schema:headline": "Only Those of His Slaves with Knowledge Fear Allah", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "13"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq15", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq8", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah1-The-Kafir\u2019s-Blood-is-Halal-for-You,-So-Shed-It", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "1", "schema:articleBody": "In his famous mu\u2019allaqah poem, the Jahili poet \u2018Amr Ibn Kulthum said, \u201cAnd we had many glorious and long days, we defied the king therein, lest we obey.\u201d The word he used for \u201cwe obey\u201d is \u201cnadin,\u201d from the well-known but oft-misunderstood root word \u201cdin.\u201d Usually translated as \u201creligion,\u201d and indeed it is that, one of the basic meanings of din is obedience, and is especially used \u2013 as in the above verse of poetry \u2013 in reference to the authority and rule of a king. Allah \uf063 said in the story of Yusuf \uf06e, \u201cThus We plotted for Yusuf. He would not take his brother by the din of the king\u201d (Yusuf 76), meaning, \u201cby the rule and authority of the king,\u201d or as at-Tabari commented, \u201cYusuf would not take his brother by the rule, judgment, or obedience of the king of Egypt.\u201d He then mentioned the various statements of the Salaf suggesting that \u201cdin\u201d in this ayah means sultan (authority), qada (judgment), and hukm (rule), ending his commentary by saying, \u201cAnd the basis of din is obedience.\u201d\nAs for our King \u2013 the King of mankind, the King of the Day of Recompense, the True King \uf062 \u2013 then we have entered into His din and must obey His rule wholeheartedly, and He \uf063 said, \u201cAnd fight them until there is no fitnah and the din is for Allah. But if they cease, then there is no aggression except against the tyrants\u201d (Al-Baqarah 193). So the command of Allah \u2013 to which obedience is due as a religious duty \u2013 is to fight until there is no fitnah, i.e. evident shirk in the obedience of Allah, and until no manifest authority \nis given to any rule except to that of the True King. His saying, \u201cif they cease,\u201d means that if they submit or surrender, then they are to be left alone. This can either be in the form of repentance to Allah and abiding  by  His  worship  alone  or  by  the  paying  of  jizyah while  remaining  upon  subjugated  kufr,  just  as  Allah said, regarding the command of killing the mushrikin in general, \u201cThen if they repent, establish the prayer, and pay the zakah, then leave them alone\u201d (At-Tawbah 5), and He said that the People of the Book \u2013 those who \u201cdo not adhere to the true din\u201d \u2013 should specifically be fought \u201cuntil they pay the jizyah willingly, while they are humiliated\u201d (At-Tawbah 29).\nAnd  \u201cthere  is  no  aggression  except  against  the  tyrants\u201d means those who did not submit nor surrender, either through repentance or dhimmah, the covenant of jizyah. Thus, anyone who is neither a Muslim nor a  dhimmi  kafir  (while  still  a  tyrant  against  himself, deserving both hatred and humiliation) is a hostile tyrant deserving aggression. This is because shirk itself is dhulm  (tyranny),  as  Allah  said,  \u201cAnd  when  Luqman said to his son, admonishing him, \u2018O my son, do not commit shirk with Allah. Verily shirk is a great tyranny\u2019\u201d (Luqman 13). And although the people of dhimmah are mushrikin from the People of the Book, their shirk is subjugated and humiliated under the Shari\u2019ah of Allah enforced upon them.\nSo the duty to fight the tyrants \u2013 the mushrikin \u2013 is \n3434\n\fclear and established. But Allah did not only command the \u201cfighting\u201d of disbelievers, as if to say He only wants us to conduct frontline operations against them. Rather, He has also ordered that they be slain wherever they may be \u2013 on or off the battlefield. He \uf063 said, \u201cSo when the sacred months have  passed,  then  kill  the  mushrikin  wherever  you  find them and take them, surround them, and wait for them at every outpost\u201d (At-Tawbah 5). All of this becomes all the more apparent for those who have realized that the blood of a kafir is cheap, filthy, and permissible to shed.\nIslam  is  the  religion  of  sound  principles  providing  the perfect  foundations  upon  which  the  solid  structures  of justice and glory are built. One of these great principles is that all people must be fought until they accept Islam or come under a shar\u2019i covenant. This principle establishes the prohibition of shedding Muslim and covenant-bound kafir blood as well as the permissibility of shedding the blood of all other kuffar. The Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cI have been ordered to fight mankind until they say that there is no god except Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah, and they establish the prayer and pay the zakah. Whoever does so, then his blood and wealth are safe from me except for a lawful reason\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar), and he \uf067 said, addressing the Muslims, \u201cFor verily your blood, wealth, and honor are haram to each other\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Bakrah). And regarding the dhimmi \u2013 the one who has a covenant with the Muslims \u2013the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever kills a person of covenant shall not smell the fragrance of Jannah, which can be found for a distance of forty years\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from \u2018Abdullah Ibn \u2018Amr). These narrations offer an explanation of the ayah, \u201cAnd do not kill a soul which Allah has forbidden except for a lawful reason\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 151), about which at-Tabari said, \u201cThe soul which Allah has forbidden is the soul of a believer or a person of covenant, and His saying, \u2018except for a lawful reason,\u2019 means that which permits such a soul to be killed, as in capital punishment for murder, or stoning an adulterer to death, or killing someone for apostasy.\u201d\nAs for all others \u2013 meaning all disbelievers who have no covenant \u2013 then their blood has not been given the sanctity of prohibition, but remains under the command to fight mankind, so their blood remains halal. Shedding the blood of a non-dhimmi kafir is not sinful, but is rather rewarded with Jannah. Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cA kafir and his killer will never be gathered together in the Fire\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah). Furthermore, his words, \u201cI have been ordered to fight mankind,\u201d leave no room for debate, as mankind includes every person in the world, and the only ones excluded from this order to fight are those who submit or surrender to the rule of Islam, as was previously mentioned. This alone befits a messenger who was sent to all people, as Allah \uf062 said, \u201cSay, \u2018O mankind, verily I am the Messenger of Allah sent to all of you\u2019\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 158), and the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cOther prophets were sent to their people alone, but I was sent to all of mankind\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Jabir Ibn \u2018Abdillah).\nLest  someone  think  this  is  a  strange,  new  opinion,  it should be known that this is the stance of the Sahabah and the greatest scholars of the Ummah. This is reflected in the words of \u2018Umar Ibn al-Khattab who, during the life of the Prophet \uf067 and without objection, said to Abu Jandal, encouraging him to kill his father Suhayl Ibn \u2018Amr, \u201cBe patient, Abu Jandal, for they are merely mushrikin, and their blood is nothing but (like) the blood of a dog\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from al-Miswar Ibn Makhramah). Indeed, \u2018Umar was correct, as the mushrikin are entirely impure, as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cO you who believe! The mushrikin are nothing but impure\u201d (At-Tawbah 28).\nThis  is  also  understood  from  the  words  of  Anas  Ibn Malik, who was asked, \u201cO Abu Hamzah! What makes a slave\u2019s (i.e. a person\u2019s) blood and wealth haram?\u201d He replied, \u201cWhoever testifies that there is no god but Allah, faces our qiblah, prays our prayer, and eats what we slaughter, then he is a Muslim. He gets what a Muslim gets and is bound by what a Muslim is bound\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Maymum Ibn Siyah).\nAsh-Shafi\u2019i said, \u201cAnd the kafir\u2019s blood is not spared until he becomes a Muslim\u201d (Al-Umm). In further explanation, he  said,  \u201cAllah  spared  blood  and  restricted  the  taking  of wealth, except for a lawful reason, through belief in Allah and in His Messenger or through a covenant given by the believers, based on the rule of Allah and His Messenger, to the People of the Book. And He allowed shedding the blood of mature men who refrain from belief and who do not have a covenant. Allah \uf066 said, \u2018So when the sacred months have passed, then kill the mushrikin wherever you find them and take them, surround them, and wait for them at every outpost\u2019  (At-Tawbah  5)\u201d  (Al-Umm).  Mentioning  the  exception of killing women and children, he also said, \u201cAnd the reason for the prohibition of shedding Muslim blood being different from the prohibition of shedding the kafir child\u2019s and kafir woman\u2019s blood is that they are not to be killed due to specific revelation restricting this killing [while the initial ruling allows shedding kafir blood in general]. And our opinion regarding this \u2013 and Allah knows best \u2013 is that the restriction exists so that they can become slaves, which is more beneficial than killing them, and killing them does not harm the enemy; so making them slaves is more optimal than killing them\u201d (Al-Umm).\nAl-Khattabi said, \u201cThe kafir\u2019s blood is permissible because he has not yet uttered the word of tawhid; but if he were to say it, then his blood is spared and becomes prohibited\u201d (A\u2019lam al-Hadith).\nIbn  Hazm,  after  mentioning  the  prohibition  of  targeting women and children, said, \u201cAnd it is permissible to kill anyone \u2013 other than those we mentioned above \u2013 of the mushrikin,  both  the  combatant  and  non-combatant,  the businessman and employee, the elderly man \u2013 whether or not he be a person of influence \u2013 the farmer, the bishop or priest or monk, the blind or crippled \u2013 no one is given exception\u201d  (Al-Muhalla).\n35\n\fIbn Qudamah mentioned the harbi (the kafir who is not under  a  covenant)  and  said,  \u201cShedding  his  blood  is  permissible without exception, just like swine\u201d (Al-Mughni). He also said, \u201cThe kuffar asliyyin [those kuffar who are not murtaddin]  shall  have  no  protection  in  their  own  lands\u201d (Al-Mughni).\nIbn Rushd said, \u201cAnd the principle is that what makes wealth permissible to take is kufr, and that which protects it is Islam, just as the Prophet \uf067 said, \u2018Then if they said that, they have protected their blood and their wealth from me\u2019\u201d  (Bidayat  al-Mujtahid).  While  specifically  mentioning wealth, his words clearly point to the permissibility of bloodshed as is also in the evidence he quoted.\nAl-Qurtubi, said, \u201cIf a Muslim meets a kafir who has no \ncovenant, it is permissible for him to kill him.\u201d\nAbu Hanifah said, regarding a kafir who is killed, \u201cThere is no retaliation (against the killer) and the diyah (blood money) is not to be paid, because the blood of the kafir is permissible (to shed) unless it is established that he has a covenant or is under dhimmah\u201d (Al-Hawi al-Kabir). Likewise, the famous Hanafi scholar al-Kashani said, \u201cThe principle is that it is permissible to kill anyone from amongst the people who are at war (with the Muslims), whether they fight or do not fight. But it is not permissible to kill anyone who is not from the people who are at war [meaning those with a valid covenant], unless they fight or offer strategic support, obedience, instigation, or otherwise. So the priest and wandering ascetic who mix with the people are to be killed, as are those who have fits of insanity, and the deaf \nand mute, and the one with a severed hand or foot, even if they did not fight. This is because they are from the same people who are at war [with the Muslims]\u201d (Badai\u2019 as-Sanai\u2019).\nNone of this should be surprising to any Muslim who has studied his religion, as this matter of a kafir\u2019s blood being halal to shed is something upon which scholars have recorded consensus. At-Tabari said, \u201cThey [the scholars of Islam] have agreed that even if a mushrik were to wear the bark of all the trees of the Haram [in Makkah] around his neck and on his arms, that would not grant him safety from being killed unless the Muslims gave him a covenant of dhimmah or security.\u201d\nMuslims currently living in Dar al-Kufr must be reminded  that  the  blood  of  the  disbelievers  is  halal,  and  killing them is a form of worship to Allah, the Lord, King, and God of mankind. This includes the businessman riding to work in a taxicab, the young adults (post-pubescent \u201cchildren\u201d) engaged in sports activities in the park, and the old man waiting in line to buy a sandwich. Indeed, even the blood of the kafir street vendor selling flowers to those passing by is halal to shed \u2013 and striking terror into the hearts of all disbelievers is a Muslim\u2019s duty. There is no shar\u2019i requirement to target soldiers and policemen nor judges and politicians, but all kuffar who are not under the covenant of dhimmah are fair game. How can the disbelievers ever dream of safety and security while Muslims suffer anywhere in the world and while the rule of Allah is mockingly replaced by manmade monstrosities of democracy?\n...Even the blood of a merry Crusader citizen selling flowers to passersby \n36\n\f37\n\f38\n\f", "schema:headline": "The Kafir\u2019s Blood is Halal for You, So Shed It", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "33"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah1-The-Wicked-Scholars-Are-Cursed", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "1", "schema:articleBody": "Allah has honored knowledge and its people, raising their worth and elevating their status. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cAllah testifies that there is nothing worthy of worship except Him, as do the angels and those with knowledge\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 18). Al-Qurtubi  said,  \u201cIf  anyone  was  more  honored  than  the scholars,    Allah  would  have  mentioned  them  along  with His name and that of the angels, just as He mentioned the scholars\u201d (Al-Jami\u2019 li-Ahkam al-Quran). Likewise, Allah negated any equality between the scholars and others. He \uf063 said, \u201cSay, \u2018Are those who know and those who do not know equal?\u2019 Only those with deep understanding will remember\u201d (Az-Zumar 9).\nAnd Allah ordered to refer to them, as He \uf063 said, \u201cThen ask the people of remembrance if you do not know\u201d (AnNahl 43). But is knowledge simply memorizing texts, studying  long  books,  reviewing  manuscripts,  being  acquainted with  the  various  opinions,  and  composing  commercial works? Certainly not!\nThe  scholars  whom  Allah  \uf063  praised  and  called  \u201cthose with knowledge\u201d are those who act upon their knowledge and convey it to others. Ash-Shatibi said, \u201cKnowledge, as it is understood in the Shari\u2019ah \u2013 I mean the knowledge whose people Allah and His Messenger absolutely praised \u2013 is knowledge that instigates action\u201d (Al-Muwafaqat). Once a  correlation  is  made  between  knowledge  and  action,  it follows that there is no action without knowledge and no knowledge  without  action.\nAs for knowledge accompanied by good deeds, then it is what yields fear of Allah, bearing a person to publicly declare the truth lest he earn Allah\u2019s anger and punishment. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cOnly those who fear Allah, of His slaves, are the knowledgeable ones\u201d (Fatir 28), and Ibn \u2018Abbas \uf06b said, \n\u201cThose who are knowledgeable of Allah are those who fear him\u201d (Az-Zuhd \u2013 Abu Dawud). And Ibn Mas\u2019ud \uf068 said, \u201cKnowledge is not an abundance of reports, but knowledge is fear [of Allah]\u201d (Hilyat al-Awliya).\nLikewise, one of the deeds directly correlated to knowledge is jihad for Allah\u2019s cause, for jihad is the companion of knowledge, as found in the hadith in which the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cFor whomever Allah wants well, He gives him fiqh (comprehension) of the religion, and there will not cease to be a group of Muslims fighting upon the truth, defeating whoever opposes them, until the Day of Resurrection\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Mu\u2019awiyah).\nThe mentioning of both knowledge and jihad in this hadith indicates the correlation between the two, and that the people thereof are the victorious group (at-Taifat al-Mansurah); so upholding the religion and manifesting the truth cannot come about except through knowledge and jihad.\nThis was the situation of the Sahabah \uf06a, those who were the  most  knowledgeable  of  the  Ummah,  as  they  joined knowledge with jihad. Whoever looks into the biographies of the Sahabah, whether from the Muhajirin or the Ansar, will find that many of them were killed on the fronts of jihad, fully achieving knowledge and action. On the Day of Yamamah, for example, the memorizers of Allah\u2019s Book began to be killed, as when the banner fell, Salim Mawla Abi Hudhayfah \uf06b took hold of it. The Muslims said to him, \u201cO Salim! We fear that we will be overtaken from your direction.\u201d So he said, \u201cWhat a wicked bearer of the Quran I would be if you were overtaken from my direction!\u201d So he went forth and fought until he was killed (At-Tabaqat al-Kubra).\n28\fim said, \u201cThe ten days of Dhul-Hijjah were deemed virtuous due to the days they include, for included among them is the day of slaughter, the day of \u2018Arafah, and the day of Tarwiyah [the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah, the day in which hajj is commenced]\u201d (Zad al-Ma\u2019ad).\nMaking Much Dhikr: Allah \uf063 said, \u201cThat they may witness benefits for themselves and mention the name of Allah on known days\u201d (Al-Hajj 28). Ibn Rajab said, \u201cThe bulk of the scholars hold the view that these known days are the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah\u201d (Al-Lataif).\nAmong these ten days is a day that is great according to Allah. It is the day of \u2018Arafah, the witnessed day, the day on which Allah completed the religion, and fasting on it expiates the sins of two years. Also among these days is the day of slaughter, which is the greatest day of the year, the day of the greater hajj on which comprises a number of  acts  of  obedience  and  worship  that  are  not  gathered together on any other day.\nFor this reason, the Prophet \uf067 enjoined upon the Muslims much tahlil (saying \u201cla ilaha illallah\u201d), takbir (saying \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d), and tahmid (saying \u201calhamdulillah\u201d) in these days, as in his \uf067 statement, \u201cThere are no days that are greater according to Allah or on which a deed is more beloved to Him than these ten days, so make much tahlil, takbir, and tahmid in them\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from Ibn \u2018Umar).\nIndeed, reaching these ten days is a tremendous blessing from the blessings of Allah \uf063 upon His slaves, which none but the worshipers and the diligent truly appreciate. So the obligation upon the Muslim slave is to perceive this blessing and take advantage of this opportunity, for the Salaf would be diligent in worship on these days more so than any other day, as established in their beautiful biographies.\nAl-Bukhari said in his \u201cSahih,\u201d \u201c\u2018Umar RA would make takbir in his tent in Mina and the people in the masjid would hear him, so they would make takbir, and the people in the market would make takbir, to the point that Mina  would  shake  with  takbir.  Ibn  \u2018Umar  would  make takbir in Mina on those days, and would do so after the prayers, and on his mattress, in his pavilion, in his gatherings, and on the pathways throughout all those days.\u201d\nThere are many virtuous deeds that the Muslim should strive to perform on these days, such as jihad for the cause of Allah, reciting the Quran, diligently attending the congregational prayer in the masajid, being dutiful to one\u2019s parents, upholding the ties of kinship, being good to one\u2019s neighbors,  reconciling  between  people,  honoring  one\u2019s guest, spending for the cause of Allah, visiting the sick, etc. However, there are certain deeds that are specified for these days, including:\nTherefore, takbir is from among the deeds of the Sunnah specified for these ten days, and it is of two types: takbir performed generally and takbir performed at a specific time. Takbir is performed, in general, at all times, from the first of the ten days to the end of the days of tashriq (the 13th of Dhul-Hijjah). As for the takbir performed at a specific time, it is done after the five daily prayers (after the salam in the obligatory prayers) and it begins from fajr on the day of \u2018Arafah \u2013 for those not performing hajj \u2013 and lasts until \u2018asr on the last day of tashriq, as was reported \nThe hujjaj at Mount \u2018Arafah\n\f", "schema:headline": "The Wicked Scholars Are Cursed", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "27"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah9-The-Woman-Is-a-Shepherd-in-Her-Husband\u2019s-Home", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "9", "schema:articleBody": "Every woman to whom Allah has granted the blessing of giving birth in the Islamic State should take advantage of this tremendous grace \u2013 which Allah c has not granted to many other women \u2013 and painstakingly endeavor to raise her children in a manner that pleases her Lord and brings benefit to her ummah. And why should she not? For she is the child-rearing, nursing, and educating mother, whereas the fathers are either working for the cause of Allah or stationed in ribat.\n\u2018Abdullah Ibn \u2018Umar \uf06b narrated, saying, \u201cI heard Allah\u2019s Messenger g say, \u2018Every one of you is a shepherd and every one of you is responsible for his flock. The man is a shepherd over his family and is responsible  for  his  flock,  the  woman  is  a  shepherd  in  her husband\u2019s home and is responsible for her flock, and the servant is a shepherd over his master\u2019s wealth and is responsible for his flock\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and  Muslim).\nSisters\n\fObedience was never just a type of worship, rather it is worship itself, for it is obedience to Allah in accordance with that which He has ordered upon the tongues  of  His  messengers  \uf070,  and  that  he  doesn\u2019t obey  anyone  from  among  the  creation  except  that this obedience of his falls under Allah\u2019s obedience, otherwise it is not necessary to obey any of the creation independently \u2013 and what is meant here is the obedience that is specific to making haram what is halal  or  making  halal  what  is  haram.  So  whoever obeys a created being in that regard \u2013 other than the Messenger g, for he does not speak from his whims \u2013 then he is a mushrik, as Allah c made clear in His statement, \u201cThey have taken their scribes\u201d meaning their  scholars,  \u201cand  monks\u201d  meaning  their  devout worshipers  \u201cas  lords  besides  Allah,  and  [also]  the Messiah, the son of Mary. And they were not commanded except to worship one God; there is no god except Him. Exalted is He above whatever they associate with Him\u201d (At-Tawbah 31). This was explained by the Prophet g as their obedience in making haram what is halal, and making halal what is haram, as will be mentioned in the hadith of \u2018Adi.\nSo  if  it  is  said  that  Allah  c  has  stated,  \u201cO  you who  have  believed,  obey  Allah  and  obey  the  Messenger and those in authority among you\u201d (An-Nisa 59), then it is said, they are the scholars, and it is said they are the leaders, and these are two explanations reported from Ahmad. Ibnul-Qayyim said, \u201cAnalysis  reveals  that  the  verse  encompasses  both  groups. It  is  said  that  it  is  obligatory  to  obey  them  if  they command obedience to Allah and obedience to His Messenger. The scholars are conveyers of the orders of Allah and the orders of His Messenger, and those in authority are the executors of those orders, so it then becomes obligatory to obey them in accordance with obedience to Allah and His Messenger, as he g said, \u2018There is no obedience in disobedience, rather obedience is in what is righteous\u2019 (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). He g also said, \u2018Upon a person is to listen and obey as long as he is not ordered with disobedience,  for  if  he  is  ordered  with  disobedience  then there is no listening and no obeying.\u2019 Both ahadith are sahih, so there is nothing in this verse that contradicts the verse of Baraah (i.e. At-Tawbah).\n\u201cIbn \u2018Abbas said, \u2018Stones are about to rain on you from the sky! I say: \u2018Allah\u2019s Messenger g said,\u2019 and you say: \u2018Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar said?!\u2019\u2019\n[\u2026]\u201cThis is what Ibn \u2018Abbas said to one who disputed \nwith him regarding combining Hajj and \u2018Umrah in the time of Hajj, which Ibn \u2018Abbas used to order. The one  disputing  challenged  him  with  Abu  Bakr  and \u2018Umar\u2019s  prohibition  of  this,  implying,  \u2018They  both are more knowledgeable than you [Ibn \u2018Abbas] and more deserving of being followed.\u2019 So Ibn \u2018Abbas said those words that were pronounced from pure faith and from the absolute nature of his following of Allah\u2019s Messenger g, regardless if anyone opposed him for that \u2013 and regardless of who they may be \u2013 as ash-Shafi\u2019i said, \u2018The scholars have agreed that whoever the Sunnah of Allah\u2019s Messenger g has become apparent to, it is not for him to leave it on account of the saying of any other person\u2019\u201d (Madarij as-Salikin).So if that was the saying of Ibn \u2018Abbas to the one who opposed him with Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar \u2013 and they are who they are \u2013 what would you expect he would say to one who opposes the Sunnah of Allah\u2019s Messenger g with his imam or the founder of his madhhab, which he attributes himself to, and makes his statement a standard of measure over the Quran and Sunnah, such that whatever is in agreement with his madhhab he accepts and whatever opposes it he rejects or reinterprets?! And Allah\u2019s help is sought.\nAnd how good is that which was stated by some of \nthe later scholars:\nSo if there came to them evidence in agreementWith what the preceding forefathers were uponThey\u2019d be pleased or say, \u201cThis needs interpretation,\u201dAnd they would go to great lengths to interpret it.And  there  is  no  doubt  that  this  falls  under  the statement of Allah c, \u201cThey took their scribes and monks  as  lords  besides  Allah\u2026\u201d  (At-Tawbah  31).\nShaykh  Muhammad  Ibn  \u2018Abdil-Wahhab  said, \u201cAhmad Ibn Hanbal said, \u2018I am amazed at a people who know the authenticity of a chain of narrators, yet they go to the opinion of Sufyan, while Allah c says, \u2018So let those beware who dissent from his (i.e. the Prophet\u2019s) order, lest fitnah strike them\u2019 (An-Nur 63). Do you know what that fitnah is? That fitnah is shirk.

Their assault was assisted by B-52 and A-10 warplanes, fighter  jets,  helicopters,  and  drones,  which  bombed  in all  directions.  They  were  confronted  by  the  mujahidin, who were armed with various weapons, and fierce clashes ensued and continued for approximately 12 hours, with the Crusaders and their proxies unable make any advances.

Shall  I  guide  you  to  a deal that will save you from a painful torment? It is that you believe in Allah and His  Messenger  and  wage  jihad  for  His cause  with  your  wealth  and  your  souls. That is best for you if you only knew\u201d (AsSaff 10-11). Belief in Allah \uf063 and waging jihad for His cause with wealth and soul are emphasized here, and jihad using one\u2019s  wealth  is  mentioned  first  because wealth is used initially in order to prepare equipment  and  arm  the  troops,  and  because jihad using one\u2019s physical self (soul) has exemptions \u2013 those who are excused from fighting \u2013 and the woman is exempt therefrom. As for waging jihad with one\u2019s wealth,  then  there  is  no  excuse  for  anyone whom Allah has enriched from His bounty and who has yet to spend. There is  no  difference,  in  this  regard,  between men and women, the old and the young, the blind and the seeing, and the sick and the healthy. As for the one who is poor, \nthen there is no sin upon him for not being able to spend, due to the saying of  Allah  \uf063,  \u201cNor  upon  those  who, when they came to you in order that you carry them (to battle), you said, \u2018I do not have that upon which to carry you\u2019\u201d  (At-Tawbah  92).\nAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cWage jihad  against  the  mushrikin  with  your wealth, your souls, and your tongues\u201d (Reported by Abu Dawud from Anas).\nRegarding  the  wisdom  in  mentioning jihad with one\u2019s wealth before jihad with one\u2019s soul, Ibnul-Qayyim \uf072 said, \u201cAnd a second point of interest is that wealth  is  dearly  beloved  by  the  soul, which exerts its effort in obtaining it, undergoes risks, and may even be exposed  to  death  while  seeking  it.  This proves that wealth is dearly beloved to the  soul.  So  Allah  \uf063  commissioned those who love Him \u2013 the mujahidin \n18\fTo the west of Shaddadi, the istishhadi  brother  Abu  Yunus  Harijah  \uf08a proceeded  ahead  of  an  assault  unit, detonating  his  explosive  vehicle  on a  gathering  of  the  murtadd  PKK  in the village of Hammadat, killing and wounding  a  number  of  murtaddin. This led to the mujahidin assault unit taking  control  of  the  village.\nIn  the  area  of Tallat  Safiyyah,  situated  west  of  the  village  of  Kashkash Jubur  and  where  the  murtaddin  had stationed  themselves  in  heavily  fortified  positions,  a  group  of  inghimasiyyin  stormed  their  positions  and  the murtaddin  turned  and  fled  without any  confrontation.\nAllah  granted  victory  to  the  soldiers of the Islamic State as they broke through  the  front  line  of  defense  of the PKK murtaddin in less than two hours,  causing  a  breakdown  in  the ranks  of  the  murtaddin.\nby  the  murtaddin.  One  group  of  inghimasiyyin  entered  from  the  side  of Hammadat,  towards  the  village  of Shaykh  \u2018Uthman,  situated  southwest of  Shaddadi.  Meanwhile,  a  second group  of  inghimasiyyin  entered  the village of \u2018Adlah, the gateway to Shadadi from its southern side. After cutting off the roads and surrounding the murtaddin  in  the  village  of  \u2018Azzawi, the istishhadi brother, Abu Mus\u2019ab Suwaydan \uf08a, targeted a gathering close to the enemy\u2019s position at the school, which was taken as their second defensive line away from the village. This resulted in the killing and wounding of many  within  their  ranks.\nThis was followed by an attack by the mujahidin,  whereby  they  penetrated deep within the territory of the murtaddin. They proceeded to assault the villages  of  Shaykh  \u2018Uthman  and  \u2018Adlah,  which  represented  a  great  threat to  the  murtaddin  who  had  already started  gathering  their  forces  in  the desert, close to the village of \u2018Azzawiyyah, north of Tallat Safiyyah. While they were gathering forces, the istishhadi brother Abu Qudamah Hatlah \uf08a embarked, first chasing them down as they attempted to flee, then detonating his explosive vehicle in their midst.What then followed was a huge collapse in morale within the ranks of the PKK.  Fearing  this  collapse  and  the arrival of the soldiers of the Khilafah to the city of Shaddadi, the Crusaders \nrushed  to  send  their  warplanes,  dispatching  A10s,  B52s,  F16s,  and  unmanned Predator drones, which then began conducting dozens of systematic airstrikes on the villages taken by the mujahidin,  and  completely  destroying  some  of  the  villages,  particularly the village of Kashkash Zayyanat. This forced  the  mujahidin  to  withdraw from some of the villages that they had previously  entered.\nThe soldiers of the Islamic State took advantage  of  their  ability  to  transfer the  battle  from  one  area  to  another, maneuvering  to  avoid  the  warplanes. In this manner, they were able to attack an area, stop, and then maneuver and attack an alternate area, dispersing the effects of the Crusader warplanes.The soldiers of the Khilafah also assaulted the village of Albu Salman, west of Shaddadi. The assault began with an istishhadi brother setting out towards a gathering of murtaddin, sending them fleeing from the village. The istishhadi brother continued pursuing the murtaddin,  chasing  them,  but  returned shortly  after  without  needing  to  detonate his explosive vehicle as all of the murtaddin  had  fled.  The  mujahidin then  took  control  of  the  village,  taking as ghanimah a 4-wheel drive vehicle mounted with a 14.5mm machine gun, an ammunition-filled truck, and a hummer.\nAdditionally, the soldiers of the Khilafah conducted a raid on a group of murtaddin in the village of \u2018Inad, close to  Shaddadi.  The  istishhadi  brother Abul-Bara  Muhasan  \uf08a  advanced  towards  them,  detonating  his  explosive vehicle  in  the  midst  of  their  vehicles parked next to one of their barracks in the  village,  destroying  their  barracks and all those inside.\nThese operations resulted in the killing of around 124 murtaddin and the wounding  of  dozens  of  others.  The soldiers of the Khilafah, as a result of their battles in the village of \u2018Azzawi, also  succeeded  in  capturing  three  of the  murtaddin.\nHalab Wilayah\nOn  the  15th  of  Dhul-Qa\u2019dah,  in  a second special operation targeting the Crusaders  and  murtadd  PKK  in  the housing area of the Faruq Dam, which is  considered  a  heavily  fortified  barracks for the Americans, as well as the \nlocation  of  their  military  operations room  from  where  they  supervise  the battles  around  Manbij,  a  group  consisting of 5 inghimasiyyin of the Khilafah  assaulted  the  enemy,  clashing with the murtaddin inside. The assault began at Fajr and continued until \u2018Asr of the same day. During the course of the attack, American warplanes intervened, carrying out a number of airstrikes  in  support  of  the  murtaddin. There was no way to credibly verify the extent of losses incurred by the murtaddin as a result of the assault.\nThe area of the Faruq Dam had witnessed a similar attack on the 7th of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah,  when  7  inghimasiyyin conducted  an  attack  that  resulted  in the killing and wounding of 41 PKK fighters  and  American  soldiers.\nOn the same day, 4 soldiers of the Khilafah carried out an inghimasi assault  on  locations  of  the  PKK  murtaddin in the village of \u2018Imarah, north of  the  city  of  Manbij.  Fierce  clashes ensued,  during  which  the  inghimasi brothers used light weapons and hand \n\f", "schema:headline": "O Women, Give Charity", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "17"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah6-Interview-with-the-Military-Amir-of-Hims-Wilayah", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "6", "schema:articleBody": "Question: How was the situation on the front in the areas surrounding the city of Tadmur prior to the conquest, and how were preparations made for the attack on the city?\nAnswer: The soldiers of the Khilafah previously took control of the city of Tadmur in the month of Sha\u2019ban in 1436, and the Nusayri army and Rafidi militias were unable to recapture it despite dozens of continuous attacks in which they suffered hundreds of personnel being wounded and dozens of vehicles being destroyed. This was until they began a wide scale military campaign against the city with Russian air support at the start of the month of Jumada al-Akhirah in 1437. They mobilized thousands of ground troops (including army forces, Rafidi militias, Russian ground forces, and Russian advisors) in simultaneous coordination with a heavy aerial bombardment campaign, and on average the city\u2019s neighborhoods would be bombarded with approximately 100 rockets, barrel bombs, and explosive gas cylinders each day. The mujahidin were forced to withdraw from the city in the middle of the same month, following which the Nusayri regime sought to expand its areas of control in the city\u2019s surrounding areas. The mujahidin then began conducting a series of operations to exhaust the Nusayriyyah\u2019s resources, in addition to wide scale attacks and assaults on their positions in the areas of Sha\u2019ir and Jazal as well as in areas near the city of Tadmur, following which their operations were focused in the direction east of the city. The confrontations in the city and its surrounding areas from the period in which the soldiers of the Khilafah took control of the city for the first time in Sha\u2019ban 1436 until the start of the month of Rabi\u2019 al-Awwal in  1438  resulted  in  the  killing  and  wounding  of  approximately 1700 Nusayri army and Rafidi militia personnel, and 7  Russian  military  personnel,  including  a  military  advisor and two pilots.

Shaddad Ibn alHad \uf068 narrated, saying, \u201cA man from the Bedouins \nAllah continues to take unto Himself shuhada\ncame to the Prophet g, believed in him, and followed him. He then said, \u2018I will perform hijrah with you.\u2019 So  the  Prophet  g  told  some  of  his  companions  to look after him and teach him. Then, when there was a battle, the Prophet g took some ghanimah. So he divided it and allotted for the Bedouin a share, and gave that share to his companions. The Bedouin had taken their animals out to pasture, and when he came back they gave him his share. So he said, \u2018What is this?\u2019 They said, \u2018A share which the Prophet g has allotted for you.\u2019 So he took it and came with it to the Prophet g and said to him, \u2018What is this?\u2019 He said, \u2018I allotted it for you.\u2019 The Bedouin said, \u2018It is not for this that I followed you. Rather, I followed you so that I would be struck here \u2013 and he pointed to his throat \u2013 by an arrow and die, and then enter Jannah!\u2019 So the Prophet g said, \u2018Indeed, Allah will be truthful to you.\u2019 They then remained for a short time and then rose to fight the  enemy.  He  was  then  carried  to  the  Prophet  g having been hit by an arrow in the spot he had pointed to, so the Prophet g said, \u2018Is it him?\u2019 They said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 So he said, \u2018He was truthful to Allah, so Allah was truthful to him.\u2019 The Prophet g then shrouded him with his garment. He then brought him forward and prayed over him, and among that which he said in his prayer was, \u2018O Allah, this is Your slave.

Their goal in that regards is to fill the mujahidin with despair by terrifying them with the threat of a large number of losses in their ranks if they continue in their fight and jihad against the mushrikin and their insistence on removing shirk and establishing the religion.\nThis  is  the  habit  of  the  kuffar  in  every  era,  and that is because they measure all affairs based on material,  dunya-oriented  results,  which  is  all  that  they know.  This  is  just  the  same  as  what  was  previously done by one of their leaders following the Battle of Uhud, when he boasted about killing the companions of Allah\u2019s Messenger g, seeking therewith to fill the remaining Muslims with sorrow. But they replied to him saying that they were not eaqual, for those killed from among the Muslims were in Jannah, and those killed from among the mushrikin were in Hellfire.And Allah\u2019s c command has come to His muwahhid slaves in every era that their wounds must not stop them from increasing their pursuit of the mushrikin and their endeavor to fight them, kill them, and seize their land and wealth, as in His c statement, \u201cAnd \ndo not weaken in pursuing the enemy. If you should be suffering - so are they suffering as you are suffering, but you expect from Allah that which they expect not. And Allah is ever Knowing and Wise\u201d (An-Nisa 104). So war is not only conquest and ghanimah. Rather, it includes wounds, pain, weariness, fatigue, the exhaustion of men and equipment, and the depletion of wealth and resources.\nBut  with  everything  they  sacrifice  for  the  cause of Allah, the muwahhidin hope to attain nearness to Him c, and to draw more of the victory which He grants to His slaves when He sees the truthfulness of their jihad. And even as they seek victory against their enemies, they know with certainty that there is even greater  reward  for  them  if  they  are  defeated  in  war after having purified their intentions and exerted their efforts, as the Prophet g said, \u201cNo fighter or detachment carries out a raid, takes ghanimah, and returns safely except that they have received two thirds of their rewards, and no fighter or detachment fails to acquire ghanimah  and  is  afflicted  except  that  their  rewards will be given in full\u201d (Reported by Muslim). So after every defeat, they make more sacrifices for the sake of pleasing the Lord of the heavens and the earth, until the religion becomes entirely for Allah or they perish in the process, just as their Lord c described them in \nThe mujahidin continue to pursue and punish the kuffar\n\f", "schema:headline": "They Say, \"We Fear That a Calamity May Strike Us\"", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq6", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://gsi.dit.upm.es/#scrapingActivity", "@type": "schema:Article"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah11-And-When-the-Believers-Saw-the-Confederates", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "All praise is due to Allah, who said in His Book, \u201cAnd  when  the  believers  saw  the  confederates,  they said,  \u2018This  is  what  Allah  and  His  Messenger  had promised us, and Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth.\u2019 And it increased them only in faith and acceptance\u201d  (Al-Ahzab  22).\nI bear witness that there is no god but Allah, alone and without partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad  is  His  slave  and  messenger,  whom  Allah  sent with the sword before the Hour as a bringer of glad tidings and a warner, and as a caller to Allah with His permission and an illuminating lamp. Through him Allah established the proof, clarified the correct path, and brought triumph to the true religion. He waged jihad in the path of Allah until the religion became upright by him. May Allah\u2019s blessings and abundant peace be upon him, and upon his family. As for what follows:\nIndeed, from the sunnah (established way) of Allah \uf063 which neither alters nor changes is that He tests His believing slaves, as He \uf063 has informed us with His statement, \u201cDo the people think that they will be left to say, \u2018We believe\u2019 and they will not be tried? But We have certainly tried those before them, and Allah will surely make evident those who are truthful, and He  will  surely  make  evident  the  liars\u201d  (Al-Ankabut 2-3).\nHe \uf063 also said, \u201cAnd if Allah had willed, He could have taken vengeance upon them [Himself], but [He ordered armed struggle] to test some of you by means of others. And those who are killed in the cause of Allah - never will He waste their deeds\u201d (Muhammad 4).\nThus, it was it was a must for the believer to accustom himself to facing trials. It is mentioned in the qudsi hadith which the Messenger g narrates from his  Lord  \uf063,  \u201cIndeed,  my  Lord  commanded  me  to teach you what you are ignorant of, from among that which He taught me today. [He said,] \u2018Every wealth which I grant to [My] slave is halal. Indeed, I creat-\ned all My slaves inclining to tawhid, and indeed the devils came to them and took them away from their religion, forbade from them what I had permitted for them, and ordered them to ascribe partners to me for whom I have not revealed any authority.\u2019 And indeed Allah looked to the people of the earth and detested them \u2013 the Arabs among them and the non-Arabs \u2013 except for some who remained from among the people of the Scripture, and He said, \u2018I have only sent you in order to try you and to try by way of you, and I have revealed to you a book which water cannot wash (i.e. which will be preserved in the people\u2019s breasts), and which you will read while asleep and while awake (i.e. with ease).\u2019 And indeed Allah commanded me to burn Quraysh, so I said, \u2018My Lord, then they will split my head like a piece of bread.\u2019 He said, \u2018Expel them as they expelled you, raid them and we will aid you, spend and We shall spend on you, send forth an army and We shall send forth five of its like, and fight those who disobey you with those who obey you\u2019\u201d (Reported by Muslim).\nAnd these trials which the Islamic State is passing through today \u2013 of the gathering of the paths of kufr and the factions against it \u2013 are but an affirmation of that promise. So we do not say except as our righteous predecessors from among the companions of Allah\u2019s Messenger  g  said  when  they  saw  the  confederates, \u201c\u2018This is what Allah and His Messenger had promised us,  and  Allah  and  His  Messenger  spoke  the  truth.\u2019 And it increased them only in faith and acceptance\u201d (Al-Ahzab 22).\nAnd indeed, Allah revealed in Surat Al-Baqarah, \u201cOr do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until [even their] messenger  and  those  who  believed  with  him  said, \u2018When is the help of Allah?\u2019 Unquestionably, the help of Allah is near\u201d (Al-Baqarah 214).

This  was  because  it meant \u2013 based on their corrupt principle \u2013 that the people had to remain without a jama\u2019ah, and without \nan imam who they could rally behind, pray behind, and fight their enemies behind, and without a judge who would settle their disputes, all this in addition to the rulings of the Shari\u2019ah being suspended and the people submitting to the rulings of the tawaghit, and in addition to the rites of the religion being abolished and its symbols ceasing to exist. And all this so that there  would  come  about  the  conditions  which  they claim are necessary for the emergence of their absent, fabricated  imam  in  order  to  rule  them,  lead  them, and govern them with justice, and rule them with the Shari\u2019ah.\nFrom the Leadership of an Infallible Person to \nWilayat al-Faqih\nGeneration  after  generation,  the  tawaghit  of  the Rafidah  would  endeavor  to  free  themselves  of  the shackles which they had placed on their own necks and the fetters with which they had bound their own hands and feet, and would endeavor to come out of the trap which they had dug themselves into. So they began  to  work  on  justifying  their  fulfillment  of  the roles which they had previously confined to their absent  imam,  beginning  with  issuing  fatawa,  judging, collecting the khums, and overseeing the awqaf (endowments) and the wealth of the orphans, until they eventually made the claim that they had the right to rule the people as deputies of the imam, and claimed that they had taken that right with regards to all of that  from  the  absent  imam,  either  through  letters falsely attributed to him, or narrations falsely attributed  to  their  previous  imams.

So he is required to act justly towards it, take care of its interests, and will be asked as to whether he fulfilled what was obligatory on him concerning his flock or did not.\nWhen  the  Prophet  g  states,  \u201cThe  woman  is  a shepherd in her husband\u2019s home and is responsible for her flock,\u201d it is a tremendous task and an enormous trust that has been placed on the Muslim woman, and which contains what it contains of great reward and recompense if she fulfills what is obligatory upon her with respect to her flock, which are her children. It likewise  contains  what  it  contains  of  reckoning  and punishment  if  she  puts  this  trust  to  loss  and  shows neglect  concerning  her  flock.\nAllah c said, \u201cO you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones\u201d (At-Tahrim 6). Ibn \u2018Umar \uf06b said to a man, \u201cDiscipline your son, for you will be asked concerning your son, \u2018Upon what did you discipline him,  and  what  did  you  teach  him,\u2019  and  he  will  be asked concerning his pious conduct towards you and his obedience to you\u201d (Reported by al-Bayhaqi).\nBegin with Tawhid\nThe first thing that the Muslim woman must do when  her  children  first  begin  speaking  is  to  teach them the testimony \u201cThere is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah\u201d along with its meaning. Among that which is reported from \u2018Ali Ibn al-Husayn r is that he would teach his child, telling him, \u201cSay, \u2018I believe in Allah and disbelieve in taghut\u2019\u201d (Reported by Ibn Abi Shaybah). Likewise, the mother should teach her child the three principles: \u201cWho is your lord?\u201d \u201cWhat is your religion?\u201d and \u201cWho is your prophet?\u201d Likewise, she should ask the child, \u201cWhere is Allah?\u201d and \u201cWhat is the Quran?\u201d and other such questions which establish the foundation for a sound \u2018aqidah and pure tawhid within the child.\nAnd among the most beautiful things that a child can  learn  is  that  Allah  c  is  with  His  slave.  So  he learns to fear Allah \uf062, internally venerates the affair of his Creator, and perceives that He is watching him in secret and in public.\nAnd here you have \u2018Abdullah at-Tustari r who, as a child, would repeatedly utter before sleeping, \u201cAllah witnesses me, Allah sees me, Allah is with me\u201d (Reported by Ibn Abi Shaybah).\nThe Mother\u2019s Uprightness Is Reason for Her Chil-\ndren\u2019s Reform\nIt is upon the model, educating mother to reform herself so that she can succeed in reforming her children in her home, for indeed the uprightness of the flock is connected to the uprightness of the shepherd, and the uprightness of the children is connected to the uprightness of the mother.\nIbn Abid-Dunya narrated that \u2018Atabah Ibn Abi Sufyan  said  to  his  son\u2019s  instructor,  \u201cO  Abu  \u2018Abdis-Samad,  let  your  first  means  of  reforming  my  children be that you reform yourself, for indeed their deficiencies will be tied to your deficiency. They will consider whatever you do to be good and will consider to be indecent whatever you deem to be so\u201d (An-Nafaqatu \u2018alal-\u2018Iyal).\nAccustoming Them to Zuhd and a Harsh Life-\nstyle\nThe  mother  should  likewise  cultivate  within  her children  that  this  dunya  is  a  place  of  journey  and that  the  Hereafter  is  the  place  of  permanent  settlement. Allah \uf062 states upon the tongue of the believer from among the family of Fir\u2019awn, \u201cO my people, this worldly life is only [temporary] enjoyment, and indeed,  the  Hereafter  \u2013  that  is  the  home  of  permanent settlement\u201d (Ghafir 39). As such, these children should practice zuhd with respect to this fleeting dunya,  so  that  the  worldly  life  becomes  trivial  to  them and the Hereafter becomes significant to them, with the mother nurturing them upon a difficult life and some aspect of rough living. She should teach them the meaning of zuhd and the fact that the blessings which  they  enjoy  are  transient,  and  there\u2019s  nothing better  in  this  regard  than  the  sirah  of  the  Prophet g, the imam of all ascetics. \u2018Urwah narrated saying, \u201c\u2018Aishah \uf069 said, \u2018We would see one crescent moon, and then another, and then another \u2013 three crescents in two months \u2013 and no fire would have been lit in the houses of Allah\u2019s Messenger g!\u2019 I said, \u2018O my aunt, what was it that used to sustain you?\u2019 She said, \u2018The two black things \u2013 dates and water.

So it is no surprise that these two mutually supportive fronts will use similar names for  their  campaigns,  as  the Turkish  murtaddin  and their allies call their mission \u201cEuphrates Shield\u201d and the Kurdish murtaddin and their allies call theirs \u201cEuphrates Wrath.\u201d Under this pretext, Turkey achieved American approval to advance towards Jarabulus and Ra\u2019i in order to reach the city of Bab, even securing air cover for them, along with support and weapons, during many stages of the operation.\nThen, to overstep the disapproval of the Nusayri regime  and  its  Russian  and  Iranian  allies,  the  murtadd Turkish government began negotiating with the Russian  Crusaders,  convincing  them  to  agree  to  an advance in the northern and eastern countryside of Halab,  assuring  them  that  this  advance  was  for  the sake of fighting the Islamic State \u2013 and that in no way would they affect the Nusaryi regime and its allies, of Rafidah and others.\nThis Project\u2019s Importance to Turkey\nThe  taghut  Erdogan  and  members  of  his  apostate government increased in talking about the \u201cSafe Zone,\u201d mentioning its being a means of preventing the  establishing  of  the  Kurdish  state,  to  which  the secular  kafir  PKK  aspires.  As  such, Turkey  seeks  to take control over the area stretching between Jarabulus and \u2018Azaz, covering more than 50 km of land, which would prevent the areas ruled by the apostate PKK militants east and west of the Euphrates from joining together. Doing so, the Turkish murtaddin would make this area \nSince the beginning of the current jihad in Sham, the Turkish taghut Erdogan has been marketing the idea of an area in which those who are fleeing from Nusayri  airstrikes  might  gather,  offering  them  places of refuge, services, and protection from bombardment.  Doing  so,  the  burden  of  defending  this  area would be put on the shoulders of the Turkish army and its aircraft, though beneath the shade of America and NATO. However, this idea failed due to a lack of  agreement  on  behalf  of  America  and  its  allies  in NATO,  as  they  even  withdrew  their  advanced  \u201cPatriot\u201d air defense missile systems, which would have been able to guard the safe zone from Nusayri planes.\nTurkey Receives Initial Approval\nAs the intensity increased in the war against the Islamic State \u2013 a war waged by the international Crusader coalition and led by America \u2013 it became possible for any side to market their personal projects, on the condition that they support the war against the Islamic State. So the taghut Erdogan and his apostate allies in the Sahwah factions raised the \u201cSafe Zone\u201d project again, but with a new concept, that this area would be used as a base to fight against the Islamic State and a new point from which to launch attacks, just  as  has  been  done  by  the  Rafidah  in  Iraq,  the Peshmerga in Kurdistan, the PKK in the Jazirah, and \nArticle\n\fThe banners of jihad and hisbah cannot be raised without wala and bara\nabout that.

In narrating his story \u2013 as reported in Sahih al-Bukhari \u2013 Ka\u2019b \uf068 said, \u201cThe Prophet g forbade the Muslims from speaking to the three of us specifically from among those who had remained behind, so we avoided the people, and they changed their attitude towards us to the extent that it was as if the land had changed and was no longer the one I recognized. We remained that way for fifty nights. As for my two companions, they gave up and \nremained in their homes, weeping, and as for me, I was the youngest and strongest of them, so I would go out and attend the prayer with the Muslims, and I would walk around in the markets and no one would speak to me. I would come to Allah\u2019s Messenger g and give him salam while he was sitting in his gathering after the prayer, and I would say to myself, \u2018Did he move his lips responding to my salam or not?\u2019 Then I would pray near him and would steal a glance at him. When I was busy with my prayer he would turn to me, and when I turned towards him he would turn away  from  me.  When  the  people\u2019s  harshness  lasted long, I went walking and then scaled the wall of Abu Qatadah, who was my cousin and the most beloved person to me. I gave him salam, but by Allah he did not return the salam. So I said, \u2018O Abu Qatadah, I ask you by Allah, do you know that I love Allah and His Messenger?\u2019 But he was silent. So I repeated it to him and asked him by Allah, but he was silent. So I repeated it to him and asked him by Allah, and he said, \u2018Allah and His Messenger know best,\u2019 so my eyes filled with tears.\u201d\nHe remained in this state, with the Muslims boycotting him, until Allah turned to him and his brothers in forgiveness.

That was  after  they  turned  away  from  what  was  obligated upon them by Allah\u2019s saying, \u201cHold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 103), including the tawhid of Allah in His rule and  uniting  under  a  single  imam  who  establishes  the Shari\u2019ah through them and wages war against the kafir parties resisting the Shari\u2019ah.\nWhen some of the Syrian Sahwat realized that their situation  would  end  up  like  that  of  the  Iraqi  Sahwat, ending  up  being  struck  with  humiliation  and  misery, they spread the news of their endeavor to form a jahili, superficial union, in which they will curse one another for the sake of their personal and factional interests. It is as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cYou consider them united, but their hearts are divided. That is because they are a people who do not comprehend\u201d (Al-Hashr 14).\nThis division is the reaping of what they sowed, as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cFrom those who say, \u2018We are Christians,\u2019 We  took  their  covenant;  but  they  forgot  a  portion  of what they were reminded. So We caused among them animosity  and  hatred  until  the  Day  of  Resurrection. And Allah is going to inform them about what they used to do\u201d (Al-Maidah 14). Allah \uf063 also said, \u201cThe Jews say, \u2018The hand of Allah is chained.\u2019 Chained are their hands, and cursed are they for what they say. Rather, both His hands are extended; He spends however He wills. And that which has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and dis-\nbelief.  And  We  have  cast  among  them  animosity  and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war [against you], Allah extinguished it. And they strive to spread corruption throughout the land, and Allah does not like the corrupters\u201d (Al-Maidah 64).\nThus,  regardless  of  how  much  they  endeavor  to unite, and no matter how many new formations they proclaim, their mirage-unity will vanish. \u201cThe example of those who take allies other than Allah is like that of the spider who takes a home. And indeed, the weakest of homes is the home of the spider, if they only knew\u201d (Al-\u2018Ankabut 41). Their alliances with one another for the sake of other than Allah, and their holding tightly to other than His rope, as well as their fighting for other than His cause, all make them too frail to preserve a  single  banner  to  rally  under  or  to  secure  a  state  for themselves, especially after they claimed Islam and then apostatized therefrom by having wala to the Crusaders and the murtaddin in the fight against those who established Allah\u2019s law on the earth.\nHave  the  leaders  of  the  apostate  Sahwat  not  realized and learned that the unity to which they have been called is unity by the religion of Islam and the Muslim Jama\u2019ah, not by the methodologies of nationalism and partisanship?  However,  they  know  nothing  but  desire and taqlid. So if any of the \u201cscholars\u201d of the tawaghit and the \u201ctheorists\u201d of the Sahwat achieve their desires, they blindly follow them, and they throw the words of those who do not achieve their desires against the wall. As for following what Allah has revealed, as He ordered in His statement, \u201cFollow what has been revealed to you \nForeword\fIshaq, and Abu Thawr\u201d (Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari).\nThis was demonstrated in the Sirah of the Prophet \uf067, who killed female participants in the war against Islam. Bunanah, the Jewish wife of al-Hakam al-Quradhi, killed the companion Khallad Ibn Suwayd on the Day of Bani Quraydhah. The Prophet \uf067 called for her and then had her neck struck in retaliation for the blood of Khallad (Tarikh at-Tabari). Likewise, on the Day of al-Fath, the Prophet \uf067 ordered that the two songstresses of Ibn Khatal be killed along with their master. This was because they would sing poetry in support of the kuffar against Allah\u2019s Messenger (Sirat Ibn Hisham), showing that participation in hostile war is not limited to physical combat, but includes any major show of support therein.As for kafir women and children who do not fight or otherwise partake in hostilities, then the principle stands that they should not be deliberately killed, meaning that one should not single them out for targeting. However, when they are not distinctly isolated from the kafir men or when they are not easily distinguishable from them, then their collateral killing is a justified part of the jihad against the kuffar, especially as both the modes of attack and the types of weaponry executed and utilized by the Prophet \uf067 and his followers have necessitated such.\nWith this in mind, the best practice when conducting raids is to start during the night or at the break of dawn, before the sun rises, while the enemy is asleep. At such a time, it is very likely to enter buildings where no light shines and an adult male is not easily distinguishable from women and children. Indeed, it is from the Sunnah of Allah to attack His enemies while they are asleep, whether at night or during the day. Allah said, \u201cHow many villages have We destroyed, as Our might came to them overnight or while they took a midday sleep\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 4).\nSuch was the conduct of the Sahabah even during the life of the Prophet \uf067. As-Sa\u2019b Ibn Jaththamah \uf068 said, \u201cThe Prophet \uf067 passed by me at Abwa or Waddan. He was asked about the people of an area who were raided at night, with their women and children being killed and wounded. He said, \u2018They are from them\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nAl-Khattabi said, \u201cHis saying, \u2018they are from them,\u2019 means in regards to their hukm in the religion. So the son of a kafir is ruled as being a kafir as well. He did not mean by this statement that the children\u2019s blood is lawful to spill deliberately\u2026 But if they are killed or wounded due to them being intermingled with the men, then there is nothing wrong with killing them. Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 had prohibited the killing of women and children, if doing so was done deliberately and they were isolated from the adult males\u201d (A\u2019lam al-Hadith).\nAt-Tahawi said, \u201cSince Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 did not forbid them from making raids, even though they were killing and wounding women and children whom it was forbidden to kill deliberately, it proves that what is allowed based upon this report has a different meaning than that which the first report forbids. That is, the first report prohibits deliberately seeking to kill women and children, while it is allowed to deliberately seek killing the mushrik men, even if that means killing others whom it has been forbidden to deliberately kill\u201d (Sharh Ma\u2019ani al-Athar).\n2   This includes rallying, lobbying, propagandizing, voting, and fundraising for the war on Islam.\nRegarding the ruling on killing women and children of the kuffar, ash-Shafi\u2019i said, \u201cThe Prophet \uf067 only prohibited deliberately killing them, on an individual basis, while their location is known.3 If it is asked what proves this, it is said that his own raids and his command to perform raids proves this. As those who raid the enemy cannot avoid striking the women and children. And his saying, \u2018they are from them,\u2019 means that there is no kaffarah [expiation] for killing them. They are not protected by Islam or by a covenant, and there is no disagreement between Muslims \u2013 as far as I know \u2013 that whoever maims them during a raid, then there is no kaffarah upon him\u201d (Al-Umm).Furthermore, in the first century of the Hijrah, even during the life of the Prophet \uf067 himself, the use of catapults was common in siege warfare. Certainly, catapults \u2013 much like most missiles and explosives of today \u2013 do not distinguish between those whom they maim. Even though the intended target might be the enemy\u2019s men, cities, or barracks walls, the undeniably known result of using a catapult is destruction over a particular radius. All those who happen to be in that radius are not spared the effects of this weapon\u2019s impact. The scholars of the Sirah mentioned that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 first used catapults when attacking the town of Taif near Makkah (Sirat Ibn Hisham). \u2018Amr Ibn al-\u2018As \uf068 likewise used catapults when attacking the city of Alexandria in Egypt (Ibn Qudamah: Al-Mughni).\nLastly, one should not grieve over the collateral killing of kafir women and children, for Allah \uf063 said, \u201cDo not grieve over the disbelieving people\u201d (Al-Maidah 68). Instead, he should realize that Allah, the Lord of creation, had decreed their deaths by His exact justice and great wisdom.4 Moreover, in the hadith of as-Sa\u2019b \uf068, the Prophet \uf067 showed no remorse whatsoever for their collateral deaths nor did he censure the least bit those responsible for their killings in the raid. Accordingly, one should not avoid targeting gatherings of the kuffar \u2013 whether military or civilian \u2013 in which kafir women and children outnumber the kafir men. Rather, the mujahid must strive his utmost to do whatever is permissibly possible to further Allah\u2019s cause, irrespective of the collateral carnage produced thereby amid the kafir masses.5\nMay Allah \uf063 bless the knights of the Khilafah lurking in the Crusader homelands and enable them to carry out massacres against the cross-worshiping populations therein. Amin.\n3   Meaning when they are isolated and distinguished from the men, as he explained elsewhere that the Prophet \uf067 prohibited \u201cdeliberately killing them while they are distinguished and isolated from those he ordered to be killed\u201d (Ar-Risalah).\n4   One should also recall that the kuffar have killed far more Muslim women and children. However, even if the kuffar were to have never killed a single Muslim woman or child, it would still be permissible to target the kafir masses regardless of the collateral killing of kafir women and children caused thereby, as proven by the hadith reported from as-Sa\u2019b \uf068.\n5   The blessed Nice attack in France is an excellent example of the collateral carnage wreaked during the course of jihad. The mujahid Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel \uf08a did not allow the flimsy objections of the palace \u201cscholars\u201d and effeminate \u201creformers\u201d to sway his resolve and instead, relied upon Allah \uf063, followed the Sunnah of the Prophet \uf067 (as reported in the hadith from as-Sa\u2019b \uf068), and advanced upon the hordes of Christian filth, until he achieved martyrdom, after killing dozens of Crusader citizens and wounding multitudes more. May Allah accept him and all those who follow him in good.

These operations had a significant effect on the kafir and murtadd troops, whose legions began displaying anxiety, confusion, and fear, and whose hearts were filled with terror.\nAmong the most successful means of defense against the murtaddin\u2019s advance was to booby-trap the places where  they  were  likely  to  advance,  particularly  any strategic locations, and places where the enemy wanted to give the impression of having obtained a victory. Also among  the  means  employed  was  the  distribution  of sniper units using various types of weapons \u2013 including both large-caliber and small-caliber snipers \u2013 throughout strategic locations where the enemy was exposed, as well as in high places, such as buildings.\nWe also employed explosive vehicles, which attacked the gatherings and vehicles of the kuffar that could not be reached with any other weapons, such as projectiles. The brothers also made use of camouflage \u2013 an important tool for achieving success in battle \u2013 and also divided the \n\u2022  Distancing the mujahidin from a vital economic \nand military center.\n\u2022  Ousting the mujahidin of the Islamic State from one  of  their  largest  cities,  with  the  belief  that in doing so they would succeed in significantly reducing the number of Muslims who join the Islamic  State.\n\u2022  Giving the atheists an opportunity to establish a small state for themselves near Turkish territory, with  the  belief  that  this  would  prevent  the mujahidin  from  entering  Europe  through  the Turkish  border  crossings.\n\u2022  That the Crusaders reach the banks of the Furat River and take control of the most important of the cities along the river \u2013 the city of Raqqah \u2013 as well as the major dams.\n\u2022  Deluding the East and the West into believing that the Crusader and atheist capture of Raqqah would  deal  a  fatal  blow  to  the  mujahidin  and would  be  a  factor  that  would  wipe  out  the Khilafah.  However,  they  will  fail  miserably, inshaallah, for the Khilafah will remain \u2013 with Allah\u2019s permission \u2013 until the establishment of the  Hour.\nQuestion: How have the soldiers of the Khilafah and their leaders prepared for the defense of the wilayah in general and the city of Raqqah in specific?\nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Important Advice for the Mujahidin: Part 2", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "23"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah1-The-Virtue-of-the-10-Days-of-Dhul-Hijjah-and-the-Acts-of-Worship-Therein", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "1", "schema:articleBody": "Today we observe a major occasion from among the occasions of worship, this occasion being the first ten days of the sacred month of Dhul-Hijjah, the best ten days of the year according to Allah \uf063, and He has legislated deeds for us to do during these days so that we may recover what we\u2019ve missed and mend the shortcomings in our worship. So what is the status of these ten days? And what is their virtue? What are the most important acts of worship undertaken in these days?\nIt is sufficient, in clarifying the virtue of these majestic days, that Allah \uf064 swore by them with His words, \u201cBy the dawn, and [by] ten nights\u201d (Al-Fajr 1-2). Ibn Kathir said, \u201cWhat is meant by the ten nights is the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, as stated by Ibn \u2018Abbas, az-Zubayr, Mujahid, and multiple others from the salaf and khalaf,\u201d and Allah \uf063 does not swear except by something significant! Ibnul-Qayyim said, \u201cA period of time that encompasses deeds such as this is worthy of the Lord \uf062 swearing by it\u201d (At-Tibyan).\nFurthermore,  the  Prophet  \uf067  clarified that the first ten days of the month of Dhul-Hijjah are better than all the days  in  this  world,  and  that  a  good deed done in these days is better than all  deeds  done  in  other  days.  He  \uf067 said, \u201cNo deed is better than the deeds in these days (i.e. the ten days of DhulHijjah).\u201d They said, \u201cNot even jihad?\u201d He said, \u201cNot even jihad, except a man who risks his soul and wealth and returns  with  nothing\u201d  (Reported  by  alBukhari from Ibn \u2018Abbas).\nIbn Rajab al-Hanbali said, \u201cThis hadith indicates that a deed in these days [meaning the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah] is more beloved to Allah than a deed in all other days of the world without any exception, and if it is more beloved to Allah then it is better according to Him\u201d (Lataif al-Ma\u2019arif). Ibnul-Qayy-\n\fclear and established. But Allah did not only command the \u201cfighting\u201d of disbelievers, as if to say He only wants us to conduct frontline operations against them. Rather, He has also ordered that they be slain wherever they may be \u2013 on or off the battlefield. He \uf063 said, \u201cSo when the sacred months have  passed,  then  kill  the  mushrikin  wherever  you  find them and take them, surround them, and wait for them at every outpost\u201d (At-Tawbah 5). All of this becomes all the more apparent for those who have realized that the blood of a kafir is cheap, filthy, and permissible to shed.\nIslam  is  the  religion  of  sound  principles  providing  the perfect  foundations  upon  which  the  solid  structures  of justice and glory are built. One of these great principles is that all people must be fought until they accept Islam or come under a shar\u2019i covenant. This principle establishes the prohibition of shedding Muslim and covenant-bound kafir blood as well as the permissibility of shedding the blood of all other kuffar. The Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cI have been ordered to fight mankind until they say that there is no god except Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah, and they establish the prayer and pay the zakah. Whoever does so, then his blood and wealth are safe from me except for a lawful reason\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar), and he \uf067 said, addressing the Muslims, \u201cFor verily your blood, wealth, and honor are haram to each other\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Bakrah). And regarding the dhimmi \u2013 the one who has a covenant with the Muslims \u2013the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever kills a person of covenant shall not smell the fragrance of Jannah, which can be found for a distance of forty years\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from \u2018Abdullah Ibn \u2018Amr). These narrations offer an explanation of the ayah, \u201cAnd do not kill a soul which Allah has forbidden except for a lawful reason\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 151), about which at-Tabari said, \u201cThe soul which Allah has forbidden is the soul of a believer or a person of covenant, and His saying, \u2018except for a lawful reason,\u2019 means that which permits such a soul to be killed, as in capital punishment for murder, or stoning an adulterer to death, or killing someone for apostasy.\u201d\nAs for all others \u2013 meaning all disbelievers who have no covenant \u2013 then their blood has not been given the sanctity of prohibition, but remains under the command to fight mankind, so their blood remains halal. Shedding the blood of a non-dhimmi kafir is not sinful, but is rather rewarded with Jannah. Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cA kafir and his killer will never be gathered together in the Fire\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah). Furthermore, his words, \u201cI have been ordered to fight mankind,\u201d leave no room for debate, as mankind includes every person in the world, and the only ones excluded from this order to fight are those who submit or surrender to the rule of Islam, as was previously mentioned. This alone befits a messenger who was sent to all people, as Allah \uf062 said, \u201cSay, \u2018O mankind, verily I am the Messenger of Allah sent to all of you\u2019\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 158), and the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cOther prophets were sent to their people alone, but I was sent to all of mankind\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Jabir Ibn \u2018Abdillah).\nLest  someone  think  this  is  a  strange,  new  opinion,  it should be known that this is the stance of the Sahabah and the greatest scholars of the Ummah. This is reflected in the words of \u2018Umar Ibn al-Khattab who, during the life of the Prophet \uf067 and without objection, said to Abu Jandal, encouraging him to kill his father Suhayl Ibn \u2018Amr, \u201cBe patient, Abu Jandal, for they are merely mushrikin, and their blood is nothing but (like) the blood of a dog\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from al-Miswar Ibn Makhramah). Indeed, \u2018Umar was correct, as the mushrikin are entirely impure, as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cO you who believe! The mushrikin are nothing but impure\u201d (At-Tawbah 28).\nThis  is  also  understood  from  the  words  of  Anas  Ibn Malik, who was asked, \u201cO Abu Hamzah! What makes a slave\u2019s (i.e. a person\u2019s) blood and wealth haram?\u201d He replied, \u201cWhoever testifies that there is no god but Allah, faces our qiblah, prays our prayer, and eats what we slaughter, then he is a Muslim. He gets what a Muslim gets and is bound by what a Muslim is bound\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari from Maymum Ibn Siyah).\nAsh-Shafi\u2019i said, \u201cAnd the kafir\u2019s blood is not spared until he becomes a Muslim\u201d (Al-Umm). In further explanation, he  said,  \u201cAllah  spared  blood  and  restricted  the  taking  of wealth, except for a lawful reason, through belief in Allah and in His Messenger or through a covenant given by the believers, based on the rule of Allah and His Messenger, to the People of the Book. And He allowed shedding the blood of mature men who refrain from belief and who do not have a covenant. Allah \uf066 said, \u2018So when the sacred months have passed, then kill the mushrikin wherever you find them and take them, surround them, and wait for them at every outpost\u2019  (At-Tawbah  5)\u201d  (Al-Umm).  Mentioning  the  exception of killing women and children, he also said, \u201cAnd the reason for the prohibition of shedding Muslim blood being different from the prohibition of shedding the kafir child\u2019s and kafir woman\u2019s blood is that they are not to be killed due to specific revelation restricting this killing [while the initial ruling allows shedding kafir blood in general]. And our opinion regarding this \u2013 and Allah knows best \u2013 is that the restriction exists so that they can become slaves, which is more beneficial than killing them, and killing them does not harm the enemy; so making them slaves is more optimal than killing them\u201d (Al-Umm).\nAl-Khattabi said, \u201cThe kafir\u2019s blood is permissible because he has not yet uttered the word of tawhid; but if he were to say it, then his blood is spared and becomes prohibited\u201d (A\u2019lam al-Hadith).\nIbn  Hazm,  after  mentioning  the  prohibition  of  targeting women and children, said, \u201cAnd it is permissible to kill anyone \u2013 other than those we mentioned above \u2013 of the mushrikin,  both  the  combatant  and  non-combatant,  the businessman and employee, the elderly man \u2013 whether or not he be a person of influence \u2013 the farmer, the bishop or priest or monk, the blind or crippled \u2013 no one is given exception\u201d  (Al-Muhalla).\n\f", "schema:headline": "The Virtue of the 10 Days of Dhul-Hijjah and the Acts of Worship Therein", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "30"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah11-Our-Journey-to-Allah", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "The  time  has  come  to  distinguish  and  separate the truthful from the liar, the righteous from the wicked, the believer from the hypocrite, and those  who  are  steadfast  and  unshakable  from those  who  despair  and  lose  hope;  to  separate those who truly desire Jannah from deep within their hearts from those who only make the claim on the tip of their tongues. I ask Allah to make us among those who remain steadfast until the end to witness the victory or grant us the provision of an accepted shahadah.\nI invite my sisters in the Islamic State who \u2013 by Allah\u2019s grace \u2013 have remained firm, patient and persevering, to lend me their ears, as I believe we are in serious need of reminders and rectification. \n12SISTERS\nSISTERS\fIn the Battle of Badr, our Lord told us of the condition of our prophet g and his noble companions with their enemy, saying, \u201cAlready there has been for you a sign in the two armies which met - one fighting in the cause of Allah and another of disbelievers. They saw them [to be] twice their [own] number by [their] eye-\nthat they would not enter Paradise except after having been tried as these nations before had been, with poverty and need, with agony and illness, and with being  shaken  by  the  enemy.  Then,  when  the  ahzab came in the year of the [battle of the] trench and they saw them, they said, \u2018This is what Allah and His Messenger  had  promised  us,  and  Allah and  His  Messenger spoke the truth,\u2019 and they  knew  that  Allah  had  tried  them with  being  shaken, and  that  there  had come  to  them  the likes  of  what  had come  to  those  who had passed on before them. And it did not increase them except in  faith  and  in  acceptance  of  Allah\u2019s judgment  and  command.  And  this  is the condition of the truthful  Muslims today,  just  as  it  has been the condition of the truthful Muslims in every era. Indeed, these trials \u2013 through which the Muslims in the Khilafah State have been afflicted, with these corrupting disbelievers who are attacking the shari\u2019ah of Islam \u2013 have a similar precedent in the era of Allah\u2019s  Messenger  g  through  which  Allah  tried  His Prophet and the believers, and on account of which He \uf063 revealed clear surahs and ayat, and the books of the Sunnah are abound with the mention of many of these events. Imam Ibn Taymiyyah said, \u201cIndeed, the texts of the Book and the Sunnah which represent the call of Muhammad g encompass all of mankind, and Allah\u2019s covenants in His Book and in the sunnah of His Messenger encompass the last of this ummah just as they encompassed the first of this ummah. And Allah only narrated to us the stories of those nations that came before us so that they would serve as a lesson for us, such that we would compare our condition to theirs and measure the last of the nations in accordance  with  the  first  of  them,  and  thus  the  believer from  among  the  latecomers  would  have  something resembling what the believers from among the predecessors had.\u201d This marks the end of his words.\nTHE RAFIDAH HAVE RALLIED AGAINST US UNDER THE BANNER OF THE CRUSADERS\nsight. But Allah supports with His victory whom He wills. Indeed in that is a lesson for those of vision\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 13). He also told us of their besieging of Bani an-Nadir, saying, \u201cIt is He who expelled the ones who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture from their homes at the first gathering. You did not think they would leave, and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allah; but [the decree of] Allah came upon them from where they had not expected, and He cast terror into their hearts [so] they destroyed their houses by their [own] hands and the hands of the believers. So take warning, O people of vision\u201d (Al-Hashr 2). So He commanded us to take a lesson from the conditions of those who\u2019ve preceded us in this nation as well as those nations came before us. He \uf065 then mentioned in more than one place in His Book that His sunnah concerning the nations is a sunnah that remains consistent and continuous. He \uf063 said, \u201cAnd if those who disbelieve had fought you, they would have turned their backs [in flight]. Then they would not find a protector or a helper.

Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet  g  said,  \u201cDo  not  prevent  the female slaves of Allah from the masajid of Allah, and [when they go to the masjid] let them go without putting on perfume\u201d (Reported by Abu Dawud). Imam Muslim r reported in the hadith of Zaynab, the wife of \u2018Abdullah Ibn Mas\u2019ud \uf069, that she said, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger g told us, \u2018If one of you [women] attends the masjid, let her not touch any perfume.\u201d\nMusa  Ibn  Yasar  narrated,  saying,  \u201cA  woman  passed by Abu Hurayrah and her scent was wafting, so he said, \u2018Where are you going, O female slave of Al-Jabbar (the AllPowerful)?\u2019 She said, \u2018To the masjid.\u2019 He said, \u2018And you put on perfume?\u2019 She said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 So he said, \u2018Go back and take a bath, for indeed I heard the Prophet g say, \u2018Allah will not accept any prayer from a woman who goes to the masjid with her perfume wafting until she goes back and takes a bath\u2019 (Reported by Ibn Khuzaymah, and by al-Bayhaqi in al-Adab). And in general, a woman wearing perfume when she leaves her house is prohibited regardless of whether she is going to the masjid or elsewhere, and it is not permissible for anyone to smell the fragrance of a woman other than her husband and her maharim (near-relatives).\nAnd on her way to the masjid, the woman must avoid walking in the middle of the path and should instead stick to the sides of the path. Hamzah Ibn Abi Usayd al-Ansari reported that his father narrated that Allah\u2019s Messenger g came out of the masjid and the men had mixed with the women on the road, so he said to the women, \u201cRemain back, as it is not for you [women] to dominate the road. Stay on the sides of the path.\u201d So the women would walk adjacent to the wall, so much so that their garments would get caught on the wall due to them walking so closely to it (Reported by Abu Dawud and at-Tabarani).\nThe Sunan and Etiquettes of Entering the Masjid\nAs for when a woman enters the masjid, it is legislated for  her  to  pray  two  rak\u2019at  before  sitting  down.  Abu \nA WOMAN\u2019S PRAYER IN HER HOME IS BETTER THAN HER PRAYER IN THE MASJID\nQatadah \uf068 said, \u201cThe Prophet g said, \u2018When one of you enters the masjid, let him not sit down until he has prayed two rak\u2019at\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim). And if the woman enters the masjid and the iqamah has already been called, there is no prayer at that point other than the obligatory prayer. Abu Hurayrah \uf068 narrated that the Prophet g said, \u201cWhen the iqamah is called, there is no prayer other than the obligatory prayer\u201d (Reported by Muslim).\nIt is upon the Muslimah to seek out the last of the women\u2019s  rows  for  prayer,  for  Abu  Hurayrah  \uf068  said, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger g said, \u2018The best row for the men is the first row and the worst is the last row, and the best row for the women is the last row and the worst is the first  row\u2019\u201d  (Reported  by  Muslim).  So  we  find  that  the Legislator takes the utmost concern to distance her from the men, and prevents her from mixing with them even in the houses of Allah, which have not been established except  for  obedience  and  worship.\nAnd  from  the  Sunnah  is  that  the  woman  claps  her hands if something happens to her during her prayer. Abu Hurayrah \uf068 narrated that the Prophet g said, \u201cTasbih (saying \u2018subhanallah\u2019) is for the men and clapping is for the women\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nAs  for  the  manner  of  clapping,  the  fuqaha  have  a difference of opinion on it. Some of them said that the woman claps the palms of her hands, and some of them said that she claps the palm of one hand using the back of the other hand, and some of them said that she claps the palm of her left hand using two of the fingers on her right hand.\nHowever, if there are no men present, there is no harm in  a  woman  making  tasbih,  as  was  done  by  UmmulMuminin  \u2018Aishah  with  her  sister  Asma  \uf069  during  the kusuf (eclipse) prayer, as the only thing to beware of is making tasbih in the presence of men due to the fear that \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "It Will Be a Fire That Burns the Cross and Its People in Raqqah", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "31"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah10-Military-and-Covert-Operations", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "As the soldiers of the Khilafah continue waging war on the forces of kufr, we take a glimpse at a number of recent  operations  conducted  by  the  mujahidin  of  the Islamic State that have succeeded in expanding the territory of the Khilafah, or terrorizing, massacring, and humiliating the enemies of Allah.

He also gives glad tidings that many muhajirin from various regions have reached them and joined their ranks.\nRumiyah  Magazine  presents  here  its  interview with Shaykh Abu \u2018Abdillah al-Muhajir, the amir of the soldiers of the Khilafah in East Asia.\nQuestion:  Assalamu  \u2018alaykum  wa  rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. Can you tell us about the condition of the Muslims in the Philippines?\nAnswer: Wa \u2018alaykum assalam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of  the  creation.  May  blessings  and  peace  be  upon Allah\u2019s  trustworthy  Messenger,  and  upon  his  family, his companions, and those who follow them in righteousness until the Day of Judgment. As for what follows:\nThe condition of the Muslims in East Asia is like the condition of their  brothers in all the regions of the earth who neither have one jama\u2019ah that brings them together, nor an imam who leads them. They were groups, parties, tribes, and organizations who were scattered and divided, and the mushrikin benefited from this tremendously.\nWith the spread of Christianity on a large scale in this region under the sword of Crusader colonialism and with support from it, and with this continuing until the current period, wiping out Islam in this region was among the most important declared goals of the mushrikin. They attempted to place pressure on the Muslims using every means in order to change their religion and remove them from the land, and this is what gave birth to a good reaction, such that the  people  awoke  from  their  slumber  and  carried weapons  against  the  Crusader  government  and  its criminal  military.\nAnd this was what stunned the mushrikin, especially in the midst of their inability to subdue those attributing  themselves  to  Islam  and  their  inability to  subjugate  them  once  more.  So  they  were  forced to stop their shedding of blood and bring their aggression against their areas to a halt, and their greatest  dream  became  making  them  sit  back  and  not fight. But how far that is! For despite the crimes of the Crusaders, and the betrayal and treachery of the treacherous, the people continue to keep hold of their weapons, ready to fight the Christians at any time.And in this environment of enmity between the people of tawhid and the people of shirk, a new generation of youth was brought up. They learned tawhid, knew  wala  and  bara,  and  placed  before  themselves the goal of establishing Allah\u2019s rule in the land in this region which had become a thorn in the throats of the belligerent Christians, the pagan Buddhists, and all the other religions of shirk. But the large number of parties and banners, and the multitude of leaders steering  the  people  from  one  form  of  misguidance to another distanced the people from achieving their lofty  goals,  and  even  plunged  many  of  them  into shirk  and  apostasy  with  their  treading  of  the  path of the murtadd brotherhood, their entrance into democracy, and their allying with the mushrikin.\nHowever, a group of muwahhidin remained, concerned with not allowing the rule in this land to be except for Allah c. These were the vanguard among those who gave bay\u2019ah to Amirul-Muminin \uf085 and joined the Islamic State \u2013 may Allah bless it for us.\nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Military and Covert Operations", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "31"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah8-The-Kafir's-Wealth-Is-Halal-for-You,-so-Take-It", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "12Exclusive\n\fOur  Prophet  g  was the  leader  of  the  devout worshipers  and  the  zuhhad (ascetics). There came to  him  Jibril,  sent  from the Lord of the creation, offering  him  the  choice between  being  sent  as  a prophet and king, or as a prophet and slave of Allah, so he chose the latter, rejecting the keys to this temporal world as he and his family experienced all kinds of poverty and destitution,  while  living  on the minimal in the company of the best of companions. They are those who ruled the land, and to whom the  people  surrendered.\nAs for our time, after the Dunya was opened up before us, we began to lose that spirit \u2013 the spirit of that first generation of zuhhad, those who weren\u2019t deceived by this worldly life and its beautifications and comprehended that the way to be safe from it is abandoning what is in it.\nThe palace of Khosrau - The enemies of Allah lived in luxury while His Messenger g lived humbly\nProphet g was, \u201cDo not make this worldly life from our greatest concerns or the boundary of our knowledge\u201d (Reported by at-Tirmidhi).\nO  sister  of  Islam,  O  granddaughter  of  \u2018Aishah  \u2013 \u2018Aishah whose house dress was patched \u2013 let us reflect for a moment on the best, most honorable, and most pleasant  of  all  homes  when  it  comes  to  lineage,  religion, integrity, virtuousness, prosperity, and fear of Allah \u2013 verily it is the home of your Prophet g.\nIt was a small room that was simple and modest and  could  barely  suffice  for  two.  As  for  his  bed  on which he slept, \u2018Aishah i describes it to us as follows: \u201cThe  bed  of  the  Prophet  g  on  which  he  slept  was tanned leather stuffed with palm tree leaves\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\n\u2018Umar h reports to us a long narration in which he relates, \u201cI entered upon Allah\u2019s Messenger g as he was reclining on a straw mat, and I sat down, so he drew his lower garment closer to him, and he was wearing nothing else. The straw mat had left marks on his side. I looked towards the cupboard of Allah\u2019s Messenger g where I saw a handful of wheat and leaves of the acacia tree of similar amount at the end of the room, and skin hanging that had yet to be tanned. My eyes were overcome with tears. He g said, \u2018What makes you cry, O Ibnul-Khattab?\u2019 I replied, \u2018O Prophet of Allah, how can I not cry while this straw mat has left marks on your side, and here is your cupboard in which I find only what I see, and yet Caesar and Khosrau are amidst gardens and rivers, even though you are the Messenger of Allah g and His chosen one, and this is your cupboard.\u2019 He g said, \u2018O Ibnul-Khattab, are you not pleased that for us is the Hereafter and for them is this worldly life?\u2019 I replied, \u2018Of course\u2026\u2019\u201d (Reported by Muslim).\nThe  one  who  ponders  on  the  situation  of  some women today will see from them an excessive indulgence in luxury and aspiration for this debased worldly life. When they shop, they overdo it and spend wastefully, and when they request from their husbands, they overtask and inconvenience them, and if they are late in delivering what was requested due to inability, they nag and complain. And they often push him to taking advances and loans, such that they harm his reputation among other men and he becomes distressed by asking others for so much help.\nOne  of  the  women  of  the  Salaf  used  to  follow her  husband  to  the  front  door  of  their  home  daily, requesting from him before he departed that he fear Allah with regards to what he brings home and feeds them of provisions \u2013 her concern was the halal and haram \u2013 whereas some women of today follow their husbands to the door with a shopping list that has no end,  with  no  concern  as  to  where  and  how  he  will acquire  her  demands.\nYou will find some of them having no concern in the world except for food and clothing. If she eats, she overdoes it, if she dresses, she does so boastfully, and if she sits to converse, it\u2019s usually centered around food, clothes and hairstyles.

The first detachment attacked their positions in three villages in the eastern  countryside  and  succeeded  in  killing  more  than 35  murtaddin.  Another  group,  meanwhile,  attacked the  murtaddin\u2019s  positions  near  the  Tabaqah  airbase and  succeeded  in  killing  30  murtaddin,  in  addition to destroying a bulldozer and four military vehicles, and  taking  a  4-wheel  drive  vehicle  mounted  with  a \nNews\n\f\u2018Umar  (Adel  Kermiche  and  \u2018Abdul  Malik  Petitjean) in  France,  Muhammad  Riyad,  Muhammad  Daleel, and  Abul-Bara  at-Tunisi  (Anis  al-\u2018Amri)  in  Germany,  Abu  Ramadan  al-Muhajir  (Omar  Abdel  Hamid el-Hussein) in Denmark, and others \uf08d have set heroic examples with their operations. With their blood they incited, instructed, and demonstrated practically for other Muslims how one can attain Allah\u2019s pleasure and escape His \uf065 wrath while stationed in the garrisons of the open war arena against the Crusader West.     \nHostage-Taking\nThe objective of hostage-taking in the lands of disbelief \u2013 and specifically in relation to just terror operations \u2013 is not to hold large numbers of the kuffar hostage in order to negotiate one\u2019s demands. Rather, the objective is to create as much carnage and terror as one possibly can until Allah decrees his appointed time and the enemies of Allah storm his location or succeed in killing him. This is because the hostile kafir only  understands  one  language  and  that  is  the  language of force, the language of killing, stabbing and slitting  throats,  chopping  off  heads,  flattening  them under trucks, and burning them alive, \u2018until they give the  jizyah  while  they  are  in  a  state  of  humiliation\u2019 (At-Tawbah  29).\nThis sunnah of inflicting a slaughter upon the kuffar was ordered by Allah \uf062 when He said, \u201cSo when you meet those who disbelieve, strike [their] necks until, when you have inflicted slaughter upon them, then secure their bonds, and either [confer] favor afterwards or ransom [them] until the war lays down its burdens\u201d (Muhammad 4), and likewise in His c statement, \u201cIt is not for a prophet to have captives until he inflicts a massacre in the land. You (i.e. the Muslims) desire the commodities of this world, but Allah desires [for you] the Hereafter. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise\u201d (Al-Anfal 67).\nArmed with a Firearm\nThe scenario for such an attack is that one assaults a busy, public, and enclosed location and rounds up the kuffar  who  are  present.  Having  gained  control  over the victims, one should then proceed to slaughter as many of them as he possibly can before the initial police response, as was outstandingly demonstrated by the mujahidin \uf08d who carried out the Bataclan theatre massacre during the course of the blessed Paris raid in \nwhich the three soldiers of the Khilafah, armed with assault rifles and hand grenades, stormed the theater, taking  up  positions  and  firing  at  the  Crusader  citizens present. After having killed and injured many of them, those remaining of the kuffar were taken hostage so as to slow any efforts of the responding kafir armed forces from storming the theater. The raid was immensely successful, resulting in the harvest of 89 dead Crusader citizens and over 200 wounded. Similarly,  Omar  Mateen  \uf08a  superbly  demonstrated  this scenario when, having armed himself with an assault rifle  and  a  handgun,  he  single-handedly  slaughtered 49 sodomites \u2013 by Allah\u2019s permission \u2013 and wounded 44 others, taking advantage of the slow initial police response and utilizing that window of opportunity to massacre as many of them as he possibly could.\nThe Acquisition of Firearms\nThe acquisition of firearms can be very simple depending on one\u2019s geographical location. For example:The  USA:  In  most  US  states,  anything  from  a single-shot  shotgun  all  the  way  up  to  a  semi-automatic AR-15 rifle can be purchased at showrooms or through online sales \u2013 by way of private dealers \u2013 with no background checks, and without requiring either an ID or a gun license. And with approximately 5,000 gun shows taking place annually within the United States, the acquisition of firearms becomes a very easy matter.\nEurope:  Due  to  its  proximity  to  many  conflict zones,  such  as  Ukraine,  Russia,  Turkey,  and  Sham, and due to its inability to control its porous borders, firearms  are  widely  available  in  Europe,  facilitating their  acquisition  by  means  of  gun  dealers  and  underground  criminal  networks  \u2013  for  those  capable  of attaining  those  connections  \u2013  which  are  widespread and  rampant  throughout  Europe.  This  was  clearly demonstrated by the brother Abu Basir al-Ifriqi (Amedy Coulibaly) \uf08a, who succeeded in acquiring a small arsenal of weapons consisting of handguns, AK-47 assault rifles, explosives, and a cache of ammunition.The UK: Much like its Crusader European counterparts, the UK faces a gun control dilemma as it feebly attempts to fend off the influx of weapons, but to no  avail.  Guns  are  readily  available  for  purchase  on the streets of Britain, even if not to the extent of their availability  on  the  streets  of  its  Crusader  European partners.\n\f", "schema:headline": "Military and Covert Operations", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "41"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah13", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3-This-Is-What-Allah-and-His-Messenger-Promised-Us", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "3", "schema:articleBody": "With  the  beginning  of  the  modern  crusade against  the  usurped  Muslim  lands,  a  campaign aimed to fortify the rule of taghut therein and to prevent  the  muwahhidin  from  establishing  the religion and implementing the Shari\u2019ah, the Crusaders initiated a corresponding project to replace the religion of the people and to alter the tenets and teachings of Islam, so that it would become harmonious  with  the  jahili  American  vision  for the  world,  which  they  named  the  \u201cNew  World Order.\u201d To actualize this project, they found no better than the Murtadd Brotherhood to be the role model for people to be directed to and to thus follow, if they sought America\u2019s contentment. The Crusaders tested them and realized the corruption of their creed and their allegiance to enemies of the religion, observing the works of the Brotherhood in several lands.\nSince the followers of the Turkish taghut Erbakan  have  been  the  most  disgraceful  school  of the  Murtadd  Brotherhood,  the  most  severely  of them  drenched  in  the  swamp  of  shirk,  and  the most loyal of them to the mushrikin, one of Erbakan\u2019s students decided to enter into this project himself. Indeed, it was none other than the wicked Erdogan, for the student had far surpassed his apostate teacher in following the path of democracy  and  accepting  secularism.  He  was  appointed president, given an aura needed to deceive the fools of mankind, and tasked with overseeing several regional affairs. He had a major role, along with the tawaghit of the Arab nations, in executing the project of the Iraqi Sahwah, which assisted the Crusaders in hiding their embarrassing defeat and helped them establish the foundations of the Rafidi government in Baghdad.\nSince the beginnings of the jihad in Sham, Erdogan and his intelligence apparatuses strived to drag  the  various  militant  factions  into  relation-\n2Foreword\nships  with  him.  Through  him,  they  would  hook  up with  the  Crusader  nations,  which  used  them  to  fight the Islamic State and ordered them to stop fighting the Nusayri regime. Convoys of the militant factions would eventually leave the frontlines against the regime and, with the backing of Erdogan\u2019s army and the financing of his government, head off to fight the muwahhidin.Erdogan and his vile state attempted to keep their war on the Islamic State \u201cunder wraps,\u201d hiding behind the  murtadd  factions  that  were  formed  under  their watchful  eyes  and  nourished  by  their  support  and  financing.  This  was  out  of  fear  that  the  muwahhidin would turn on Turkey, igniting it in a blazing war that would  not  be  extinguished  until  its  borders  met  the fate  of  other  Sykes-Picot  borders  that  the  mujahidin had removed with their own hands. Then, as the battle intensified between the Islamic State and the Crusader coalition  and  its  murtadd  troops,  the Turkish  taghut revealed his prepared role and chartered mission, so he opened the airspace of his country for Crusader warplanes, opened its borders to supply the PKK atheists in \u2018Ayn al-Islam, and opened its armories for the Sahwah apostates in Aleppo. And when more was requested of him, he responded loyally, entangling his army in the battlefield against the soldiers of the Khilafah, sending \nArticle\fportion was like a great towering mountain.

And Our punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are criminals\u201d (Yusuf 110).\nO slaves of Allah, indeed, faith will not be complete in the soul of the Jama\u2019ah of the Muslims until the Jama\u2019ah is exposed to \u2013 and makes preparations for \u2013 jihad against mankind over the matter of this faith and confronting the people of falsehood with all their strength, while  exposing  itself  in  that  jihad  and  struggle  to  the hammers of tribulation and the bitterness of hardship, being patient in both victory and defeat, and being shaken and afflicted with fear. Then it remains firm and does not doubt, remains upright and does not bend, and persists upon the rightly guided path of its faith, inshaallah. And if not for these parties and this jihad, faith would have weakened and not increased, the hearts would have become  corrupt  and  not  upright,  and  we  would  have seen  the  people\u2019s  souls  becoming  stagnant,  ambitions sagging,  and  faith  shriveling,  and  this  is  how  the  situation becomes when we are afflicted with luxury. \u201cIf it were not for Allah checking [some] people by means of others, the earth would have been corrupted, but Allah is full of bounty to the creation\u201d (Al-Baqarah 251).\nIndeed, the enemies of Allah \u2013 the Jews, Christians, atheists, Rafidah, apostates, and all the nations of disbelief \u2013 dedicated their media, wealth, armies, and vehicles to wage war against the Muslims and the mujahidin in Ninawa Wilayah after seeing it as one of the bases and beacons  of  Islam  in  the  shade  of  the  Khilafah.  Seeing the  Muslims  living  in  honor  and  security  therein  deprived them of sleep, and they were burdened by seeing an example of Islamic rule being realized for the people, one that they could see and live, whose shade they could seek, and whose goodness and blessing they could enjoy. And this is what they fear most, because it is the path to spreading the authority of Islam and expanding its territory, and the path to having the people enter it.\nTherefore,  O  people  of  Ninawa  in  general,  and  O mujahidin in particular, fear Allah, fear Allah concerning the religion of Allah. Beware of becoming weak in waging jihad against your enemy and repelling them, for indeed, this will undo the bonds of Islam and extinguish the light of truth.\nO  muhajirin  and  ansar,  proceed  forward  with  your foresight and be patient upon what you have resolved. Be patient with the bitterness, for it is as if the Ummah\u2019s division will be healed soon, the word of goodness and justice will be mended shortly, and the truth will repel falsehood, for indeed, there will be another day after this one, and patience brings the best result to all affairs. Allah \uf063 said, \u201c[Their] assembly will be defeated, and they will turn their backs [in retreat]\u201d (Al-Qamar 45). Allah \n\uf065 also said, \u201cYou wished that the unarmed party would be yours [to engage].

Turn  the  disbelievers\u2019  night  into  day, bring destruction to their homes, make their blood flow like rivers, for therein you will find the richest share of reward and means for achieving great success, attaining the companionship of those upon whom Allah has bestowed favor:  the  prophets,  the  truthful,  the  martyrs,  and  the righteous. And excellent are those as companions. And let your condition declare, \u201cI hastened to You, my Lord, that You be pleased\u201d (Taha 84).

You tasted humiliation and disgrace to the extent that you grazed on it, and you strayed just as Bani Israil strayed before you. Do you not see the Rafidah, every day, afflicting you with the worst of torment? They  raid  your  lands  under  the  pretext  of  waging  war against  the  Islamic  State,  then  they  don\u2019t  depart  until they\u2019ve  either  killed  your  men  and  taken  your  women and children prisoner or until they\u2019ve driven them out. Do  you  not  see  Iraq  having  its  cities  emptied  of  Ahlus-Sunnah and filled with the most despicable of Allah\u2019s creation and the most evil of those to who have treaded the  earth?  Look  at  their  banners  when  they  fight  you, listen to their slogans when they surround your lands, contemplate their deeds when they expel you from your land, and listen to their cries when they shout with their calls  to  raid  all  the  lands  of  Ahlus-Sunnah,  from  your Iraq to your Sham to your Najd, even to your Yemen.O Ahlus-Sunnah, your rulers in the region have practiced the lowest and most despicable form of treachery history has known, for they sold your issue and surrendered  your  affair  and  your  land  to  your  enemy.

The Shari\u2019ah is full of evidences supporting and encouraging this.\nSeeking  to  bear  children  has  long  been  the sunnah of the Prophets and Messengers. Allah\u2019s Prophet  Zakariyya  \uf06e  supplicated  his  Lord,  as found in more than one place in the noble Quran \u2013 not for dominance or authority, nor gold or silver \u2013 but only to be given upright offspring. So he stood and prayed, supplicating his Lord in secret, saying, \u201cMy Lord, indeed my bones have grown  weak,  the  hair  on  my  head  has  turned white, and I have never been disappointed, my Lord, when I have called upon You. And I fear for those relatives after me, and my wife is barren, so grant for me, from Your bounty, a successor to inherit from me and from the family of Ya\u2019qub \u2013 and make him, my Lord, pleasant [to You and Your slaves]\u201d (Maryam 4-6). And he \n34Sisters\nsaid, \u201cMy Lord, grant to me, from Your bounty, upright offspring. Indeed, You do hear supplication\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 38). And he also said, \u201cMy Lord, do not leave me alone [without a successor], and You are the best of inheritors\u201d (Al-Anbiya 89).\nThere is also the wife of \u2018Imran, who asked Allah for a child, so He \uf063 gave Maryam to her and made her a sign for the creation. And He gave \u2018Isa to Maryam and made him a prophet and a messenger from amongst those of resolve \uf070.\nBy increasing the number of Muslims, kufr is terrified  and  the  religion  further  triumphs.  This equation was understood by the kuffar, while it remained absent from heedless minds.

Allah c said, \u201cAllah has already given you victory on many fields and on the day of Hunayn, when your great number pleased you, but it did not avail you at all, and the earth was confining for you with its vastness; then you turned back,  fleeing\u201d  (At-Tawbah  25).  Ibn  Kathir  \uf072  said, \u201cIbn  Jurayj  narrated  that  Mujahid  said,  \u2018This  is  the first  ayah  revealed  of  Surat  Baraah.  Allah  mentions His  favor  upon  them  and  His  generosity  for  them through His supporting them in \u2018many fields\u2019 of their battles alongside Allah\u2019s Messenger g; and that was from Him c and by His empowerment and estimation \u2013 not by their numbers or equipment \u2013 and He reminded them that victory comes from Him alone, whether their numbers are small or many. For on the Day of Hunayn, their numbers impressed them, yet that was of no benefit to them, as they turned and fled except for a few of them with Allah\u2019s Messenger g.\u2019\u201dAllah\u2019s  Messenger  g  said,  \u201cIndeed  Allah  \uf066  revealed  to  me,  \u2018Be  humble\u2019\u201d  (Reported  by  Muslim from  \u2018Iyad  Ibn  Himar).  Ibnul-Qayyim  \uf072  said,  \u201cSo indeed, being in need of Allah with some deficiency is better than being proud with none\u201d (Tariq al-Hijratayn). Muslim reported from Abu Hurayrah \uf068 that, \u201cNo one was humble to Allah except that He raised him. This raising in the Dunya is through support, victory, and good reputation; and in the Akhirah, it is through high levels and the praiseworthy station.\u201dIbn Battal \uf072 said, \u201c\u2018Aishah said, \u2018Indeed you are heedless  of  the  best  act  of  worship:  humility.\u2019  AtTabari \uf072 said, \u2018Humility is one of the tests by which Allah tests His believing slaves, to see how they will obey Him therein and because He knows the benefit for  His  creation  in  that  \u2013  of  their  dunya  and  their akhirah \u2026 Of that is when he g entered Makkah, the people began saying [in praise], \u2018He is this and he is that.\u2019 So he slumped upon his camel, saying, \u2018Allah is higher and loftier.\u2019\u2019 He then said, \u2018Tariq Ibn Shihab narrated that when \u2018Umar came to Sham, he reached a ford. So he dismounted his camel and removed his \nArticle\nshoes. Grasping them, he then plunged into the water along with his camel. Abu \u2018Ubaydah then said to him, \u2018Today, you have done a tremendous thing according to the people of the earth.\u2019 So he patted his chest and said, \u2018Perhaps if someone else said that, O Abu \u2018Ubaydah, but you [Arabs] were the meekest and lowest of people, then Allah honored you with Islam. So whenever you seek honor with other than Him, Allah will humiliate you\u2019\u2019\u201d (Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari).\nThe seventh path to victory is dhikr (remembrance) of Allah. Allah c said, \u201cO you who believe! When you encounter a company [of the enemy], stand firm and remember  Allah  much  that  you  may  be  successful\u201d (Al-Anfal  45).  At-Tabari  said  that  \u201cremember  Allah much\u201d means, \u201cSupplicate Allah for support against them  and  victory  over  them.  And  accustom  your hearts and tongues to His remembrance so that you may be successful \u2026 Qatadah said, \u2018Allah made dhikr an obligation when you are most occupied: during the exchange of clashing swords.\u2019\u201d\nAl-Qurtubi wrote valuable words when giving the tafsir of this ayah. He said, \u201cThe scholars have three opinions about this dhikr. The first is that you must remember Allah when your hearts are worried, for His dhikr assists with steadfastness during hard times.

This was in addition to the destruction of a Russian helicopter, and all praise is due to Allah.\nQuestion: What were the numbers and positions of the enemy in and around Tadmur prior to the conquest?\nAnswer: The Nusayri regime and those who support  it,  the  Russian  forces  and  the  Rafidi  militias, took  several  positions  as  their  central  points  in  the city and around it. They fortified them greatly, including Mount Tar, the city\u2019s silos, \u2018Amiriyyah Hill, and Mount Huyan, while the area of Jazal was where they set up their military barracks, atop hills overlooking the roads leading to them, also fortifying them. On the side of the Nusayri regime forces, there were Rafidi militias from Iran, Afghanistan, and Iraq, and the so-called  \u201cPopular  Committees,\u201d  as  well  as  Russian forces. The Russian forces, whose numbers were confined to the dozens, were charged with operating support and air cover and training the troops present in the area. The number of Nusayri personnel in the city was between 1500 and 2000, reinforced with dozens of armored vehicles, tanks, and heavy weapons. The Nusayriyyah gathered this force to launch an attack on positions of the mujahidin in Khayr Wilayah.\nThe city was divided based upon the militias stationed  therein.  Each  of  them  occupied  a  street  or building, painting their slogans of shirk and placing their particular flags all around, dominating the area thereby. The Rafidi mushrikin built several Husayniyyat inside the city, and they stole whatever property they  could,  even  water  tanks.  The  city  was  abound with checkpoints, there was a military base specifically for the Russian forces, and the city\u2019s condition in regards to services was extremely bad.\nQuestion: Tell us about the operation to recapture the city of Tadmur. How was it conducted and what were the results of the conquest?\nAnswer: The military operation began on the 8th of Rabi\u2019 al-Awwal. The soldiers of the Khilafah launched a wide scale, surprise attack against the Nusayri army and the Rafidi militias from 8 axes along a frontline that\u2019s approximately 200 kilometers long. They made a major advance \u2013 by Allah\u2019s grace \u2013 and took control of the city of Tadmur, as well as dozens of positions in the surrounding areas, in addition to the oil and gas fields, and vast areas of the eastern Hims countryside in a surprise attack that destroyed the Nusayriyyah\u2019s hopes of advancing on the Tadmur \u2013 Khayr highway with the intent of breaking the mujahidin\u2019s siege on the Nusayriyyah in the city of Khayr and its military airbase. The importance of the city of Tadmur lies in the  fact  that  it\u2019s  a  transportation  hub  that  connects \n\f", "schema:headline": "Paths to Victory: Part 4", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "29"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah13-Table-of-Contents", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "13", "schema:articleBody": "CONTENTS\nI S S U E   1 3   -   D H U L- H I J J A H   1 4 3 8\nO  MUWAHHIDIN,  REJOICE,  FOR  BY ALLAH WE WILL  NOT  REST  FROM  OUR JIHAD EXEPT BENEATH THE OLIVE TREES OF  RUMIYAH  (ROME).ABU HAMZAH AL-MUHAJIR r\n04 FOREWORD\nARTICLES\nOF JAHIIYYAH\nYOU BECOME OCCUPIED\nAND THE EVIDENCE FOR THE OBLIGATION OFESTABLISHING IT\n06 THE RULE OF THE SHARI\u2019AH, NOT THE RULE10 TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR SPARE TIME BEFORE 14 THE POSITION OF IMAMAH IN THE RELIGION22 IMPORTANT ADVICE FOR THE MUJAHIDIN: PART 326 THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MUNAFIQIN: PART 130 THE HIJRAH OF UMM SULAYM AL-MUHAJIRAH\n06\n10\nNEWS\n14\n36 MILITARY AND COVERT OPERATIONS\n\fSpain  experimented  with  this  matter  before, allowing herself to be led by the obeyed fool, Bush, in his invasion of Iraq as she dreamt of the oilfields and the potential revenue from construction. But she found the army that she had sent there at the forefront of  targets being struck by the mujahidin, who  continued  making  them  suffer  until  Spain was  forced  to  withdraw  its  troops  from  Iraq  in humiliation, with her soldiers licking their wounds and her government being cursed by its citizens. It appears,  however,  that  this  lesson  wasn\u2019t  enough for the Crusaders to take heed.\nSo when a later government claimed that it had understood  the  first  lesson  and  resolved  not  to have its army take part in a direct ground war, it made the decision instead to take part in the war against  the  Islamic  State  by  training  the  Rafidi army  and  providing  it  with  extensive  support  in order  to  pay  its  share  of  the  expenses  under  the framework  of  taking  part  in  the  international Crusader coalition established by America in order to fight the Islamic State.\nAnd  just  as  she  had  not  taken  a  lesson  from her prior experiment, she likewise had not taken a lesson from the experiments of the other western Crusader  states  waging  war  against  the  Muslims \u2013 states which are even more powerful than Spain and have better intelligence capabilities and more secure borders, such as Britain, France, Germany, and  America,  and  which  have  all,  nonetheless, faced the wrath of the soldiers of the Islamic State, who rushed forth in response to their leadership\u2019s incitement  to  fight  the  kuffar  in  their  own homelands. So Spain continued in her war against the  Muslims,  believing  herself  to  be  very  distant from what had afflicted her sisters.\nAnd  today,  the  soldiers  of  the  Islamic  State have repeated in multiple lands what their heroic brothers  have  done  in  other  Crusader  states, punishing  the  states  of  Turkey,  Spain,  Russia, Belgium,  and  other  lands  of  the  Crusaders  and murtaddin.\nIn Turkey, a lion of the Islamic State carried out an  attack  on  the  21st  of  Dhul-Qa\u2019dah,  stabbing and  killing  one  of  the  policemen  of  the  taghut, Erdogan, in front of their police station.\nIn  Spain,  a  group  of  Islamic  State  soldiers conducted two operations in two separate cities on the 25th of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah, with the main massacre dealing a blow to the tourism sector \u2013 which makes \nup  the  largest  part  of  Spain\u2019s  economy  \u2013  as  the mujahidin killed 16 and wounded more than 130 others from among the Jews and Crusaders, giving them a new lesson in politics that teaches them the necessity  of  preparing  themselves  to  pay  a  heavy human  and  economic  price  for  their  war  against the Islamic State before calculating the gains that they expect to make in their war.\nIn  Russia,  a  lone  knight  of  the  Islamic  State \uf08a stabbed and wounded 7 people on the 27th of Dhul-Qa\u2019dah, with his brave deed demonstrating that one doesn\u2019t need much in terms of weapons and planning in order to march forth and attack the kuffar.\nAnd in Belgium, a soldier of the Islamic State \uf08a attacked a group of Belgian soldiers on the 3rd of Dhul-Hijjah, stabbing them until he was killed.These are just some of the operations in which the  soldiers  of  the  Islamic  State  have  attacked the  Crusaders,  Jews,  and  murtaddin  in  their own  homelands,  killing  and  wounding large numbers  of  them,  particularly  in  recent  weeks. And  in  following  these  events,  one  can  see  that the  European  Crusader  states  have  not  ceased to  pay  the  heavy  burden  brought  about  by  such blessed  operations  even  after  several  months,  for their  militaries  continue  to  be  deployed  on  their streets, their security measures remain heightened, their  profit  from  trade  and  tourism  continues  to decline, and a state of terror continues to exist, the most obvious signs of which are not the widespread patrols  in  their  public  squares,  nor  the  cement barriers on their streets.\nWith  Allah\u2019s  permission,  the  attacks  in  Spain and in other kafir states will continue as long as they  are  at  war  with  the  Islamic  State,  and  with Allah\u2019s  permission,  they  will  not  be  able  to  stop them regardless of what measures and precautions they take, and they know this very well. And what is anticipated is that the soldiers of the Islamic State will escalate these attacks to a greater level in the coming  period.  So  let  the  Crusader  governments prepare themselves for an increase of loss in war, and  for  an  increase  in  what  they  hemorrhage  of wealth and of things that are precious to them, for tomorrow is close at hand.

There is no god but Him. He grants the truth victory, even if after some time. And may blessings and peace be upon the Imam of the Messengers, and may Allah be pleased with his companions from the Ansar and the Muhajirin. To proceed:Allah \uf063 said, \u201cThey want to extinguish the light  of  Allah  with  their  mouths,  but  Allah  refuses  except  to  complete  His  light,  even  if  the disbelievers hate it. He is the One who sent His Messenger  with  guidance  and  the  religion  of truth to make it prevail over all religion, even if the mushrikin despise such\u201d (At-Tawbah 32-33). Thus, every Muslim must be certain that complete  victory  is  coming,  that  Allah  will  honor this religion, that the future belongs to it, even if all nations rabidly contend against us, and that we shall definitely rule the earth by the might of Allah,  the  Powerful,  the  Strong.  And  whoever rejects or doubts that is nothing but one of the disbelieving  fearmongers.\nAllah,  the  True  King,  said,  \u201cAnd  We  have written  in  the  Zabur  after  previous  revelation that the earth shall be inherited by My righteous slaves. Verily in that is a message to a worshiping  people\u201d  (Al-Anbiya  105-106).  The  truthful and trusted prophet \uf067 said, \u201cThis matter shall reach  all  that  the  night  and  day  have  reached, and Allah will not leave a house of mud or fur [i.e. dwellings in the city or desert] except that He will make this religion enter it, through glory or humiliation \u2013 glory by which Allah glorifies Islam and humiliation by which Allah humbles the disbelievers\u201d (Reported by Ahmad). This was narrated  by Tamim  ad-Dari,  who  then  said,  \u201cI recognized that in my own household. Those of them who accepted Islam received much good, honor,  and  glory.  And  those  of  them  who  remained in kufr were afflicted with humiliation, subservience,  and  the  jizyah.\u201d\nThe  people  of  tawhid  must  know  that  a \u2018aqidah  (creed)  for  which  pure  blood  has  been spilled and for which shuhada have fought, lived, and died will definitely be victorious. Its arrows will extend to strike the neck of every kafir. And it  will  enlighten  the  heart  of  every  muwahhid. \n18Article\nBut we must all realize that the condition for victory is following the Prophet \uf067. If this adherence is present, victory shall  come,  and  if  it  is  absent,  there  shall  be  no  victory. No other cause rivals it, as the scholars have explained. Ibnul-Qayyim \uf072 said, \u201cAs such, victory and complete support is only for the people of complete iman. Allah \uf063 said, \u2018Indeed, We shall support Our messengers and those who believed, in the worldly life and on the day the witnesses rise\u2019 (Ghafir 51), and He said, \u2018So We empowered those who believed against their enemy, so they became victors\u2019 (As-Saff 14). Thus, whoever is lacking in iman will also lack in his portion of victory and support\u201d (Ighathat al-Lahfan).The Prophet \uf067 also guided us \u2013 with great detail \u2013 to both the causes for victory and the hindrances to achieving it. Ibnul-Qayyim \uf072 said, \u201cThus did he \uf067 teach them the tactics of war and confronting the enemy, as well as the paths to victory and triumph \u2013 such that if they were to learn them, comprehend them, and maintain them as they should be maintained, there would never be an enemy that could stand against them\u201d (I\u2019lam al-Muwaqqi\u2019in).\nAnd from the several causes for victory is tawhid. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cAnd they will not cease to fight you until they make you turn from your religion if they are able\u201d (Al-Baqarah 217), and He \uf063 said, \u201cThey only resented them because they believed in Allah, the Mighty, the Praised\u201d (Al-Buruj 8). This is the reality, which all mujahidin must comprehend.\nThe battle between the muwahhidin and the kafirin is fundamentally a battle of \u2018aqidah, and Allah has confined \nArticle\fing them was that all their men were to be killed and their women and children enslaved.\n\u2018Aishah \uf069 narrates, \u201cSa\u2019d [Ibn Mu\u2019adh] was wounded on the day of the trench when a man from Quraysh called Ibn al-\u2018Ariqah shot him [with an arrow] hitting an artery in his arm. Hence, Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 set up a tent for Sa\u2019d in the masjid to be close to him. When Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 came back from the trench, he put down his sword and bathed. Jibril \uf06e, shaking the dust off his head, came to him and said, \u2018You have laid down the sword? By Allah, we have not laid ours down. Set out for them.\u2019 Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u2018Where?\u2019 Jibril pointed towards Bani Quraydhah. Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 then attacked them. They later surrendered to the judgment of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067, and Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 referred the judgment concerning them to Sa\u2019d. Sa\u2019d said, \u2018My judgment concerning them is that their fighters are to be killed, their women and children are to be enslaved, and their wealth is to be divided.\u2019 \u2018Urwah Ibn az-Zubayr said, \u2018I was told that the Prophet \uf067 said, \u2018You have judged them by the judgment of Allah\u2019\u2019\u201d (Reported by Muslim). And thus, brutality towards those traitors served as a beneficial remedy, and a lesson and a warning to others.Prior to that, the Prophet \uf067 had expelled Bani an-Nadir from their homes and took their wealth as ghanimah after Allah \uf063 revealed to him their plot to assassinate him while he was in their presence. It was not long before he set out, besieging them and waging war against them, with Allah then granting him victory over them. He \uf067 also fought Bani Qaynuqa\u2019 and besieged them and did the same with the Jews of Khaybar, fighting them and conquering their fortresses by force (Sirat Ibn Hisham).\nAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 likewise would not be silent concerning the right of those Muslims killed treacherously and unjustly, unlike the evil scholars who discourage the Muslims from rising up and taking revenge against those kuffar who kill them, spill their blood, and violate their women. Ibn Kathir said, \u201cAl-Waqidi said, \u2018In the month of Shawwal, the 6th year after the Hijrah, the detachment of Kurz Ibn Jabir al-Fihri was sent to the \u2018Uraniyyin who killed the shepherd of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 and herded away the camels.\u2019\u201d\nAnas  \uf068  narrated  that  a  group  of  people  from  \u2018Ukl and  \u2018Uraynah  came  to  the  Prophet  \uf067  openly  manifesting Islam, and said, \u201cO Prophet of Allah, indeed we are a people of livestock and not a people of agriculture.\u201d They could not bear the nature of Madinah and had gotten ill. So the Prophet \uf067 ordered that they be lent a number of camels and a shepherd, and ordered the group from \u2018Ukl and  \u2018Uraynah  to  head  out  with  the  shepherd  and  drink the milk and urine of the camels. They set out, and when they reached the area of the lava field, they disbelieved after having embraced Islam, killed the Prophet\u2019s shepherd, and herded away the camels. This then reached the Prophet \uf067, so he dispatched a party in their pursuit and gave them orders [on how to punish them]. So they melted their eyes with heated nails, cut off their hands, and left them in the area of the lava field until they died in that state (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nThis was the punishment done by Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067. Even though he had forbidden mutilation, taking retribu-\ntion from these criminal apostates and their likes is something established in the religion. Thus, he did not let the killers of his shepherd go free. Rather, he sent a detachment to detain them and carry out the ruling of retribution on them.\nAnd during the conquest of Makkah (may Allah bring it back under the rule of the Muslims), Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 ordered for a number of individuals to be killed even if they were found clinging to the curtains of the Ka\u2019bah. Anas \uf068 narrated that the Prophet \uf067 entered Makkah the year of the conquest wearing a helmet. When he took it off, a man came to him and said, \u201cIbn Khatal is clinging to the curtains of the Ka\u2019bah.\u201d He responded, \u201cKill him\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nSa\u2019d Ibn Abi Waqqas \uf068 said, \u201cOn the day of the conquest of Makkah, Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 granted amnesty to all the people except four men and two women, saying, \u2018Kill them, even if you find them clinging to the curtains of the Ka\u2019bah\u2019\u201d (Reported by an-Nasai).\nThis prophetic order was also due to their harming Islam and the Muslims. The curtains of the noble Ka\u2019bah could not shield them from the law of the Lord of the creation after the severe kufr they had perpetrated with their hands and tongues.\nThese evidences from the Sirah of the Messenger \uf067 \u2013 and there are many others \u2013 do not negate from him the characteristic of compassion and mercy. Rather, these traits are in accordance with Allah\u2019s words, \u201cMuhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those with him are severe against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves\u201d (Fath 29). Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 carried out the command of Allah \uf062, who said, \u201cO you who have believed, fight those disbelievers near you and let them find brutality in you\u201d (At-Tawbah 123).\nLikewise, just as he \uf067 is the prophet of mercy, he is also the prophet of slaughter. As for taking his compassion and mercy for the allies of Allah and applying it to the enemies of Allah, then this is the methodology of the taghut scholars who want the Muslims to compromise with their enemies. Rather, the taghut scholars want the Muslims to obey their enemies as much as possible. And if the Muslim rushes to massacre the enemies of Allah and does to them just as they have done to the Muslims, including killing and humiliating them, these devils hasten to denounce him, \u201cwarning\u201d against the image of Islam and the Muslims being distorted. But of which \u201cIslam\u201d do they speak and what religion do they follow?! The religion of the taghut scholars is nothing but apostasy, which can only be cleansed by unsheathing the sword of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq \uf068.\nPart 2: In the History of the Rashid Khulafa \uf06a\nThe Sahabah \uf06a were people with the softest of hearts, the best of them in morals and character, and the most sincere of them in da\u2019wah, spreading the religion, and raising the banner of Islam. They were the most serious of people in holding tightly to the Sunnah of the Messenger \uf067 in all matters. Amongst these matters, was his guidance in dealing with the kuffar during war. The Sahabah were severe against the kuffar, showing harshness to them by sword and \n\f", "schema:headline": "Paths to Victory - Part 1", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "17"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3-Just-Terror-Tactics---Part-2", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "3", "schema:articleBody": "Vehicle Attacks\nThough being an essential part of modern life, very few actually comprehend the deadly and destructive capability of the motor vehicle and its capacity of reaping large numbers of casualties if used in a premeditated manner. This was superbly demonstrated in the attack  launched  by  the  brother  Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel  who,  while  traveling  at the speed of approximately 90 kilometers per hour, plowed his 19-ton load-bearing truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day in Nice, France,  harvesting  through  his  attack  the slaughter of 86 Crusader citizens and injuring 434 more.\nThe method of such an attack is that a vehicle is plunged at a high speed into a large congregation of kuffar, smashing their bodies with the vehicle\u2019s strong outer frame, while advancing  forward  \u2013  crushing  their  heads, torsos, and limbs under the vehicle\u2019s wheels and  chassis  \u2013  and  leaving  behind  a  trail  of carnage.\nStationed behind enemy lines, the just terror mujahid has at his disposal a multitude of weapons and techniques that he may employ at any given time to inflict misery and destruction upon the enemies of Allah, demonstrating by his actions an unforgettable lesson for every hardheaded, obstinate kafir nation that wishes to engage in war on the Islamic State. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cThrough them, disperse those behind them, that they might take heed\u201d (Al-Anfal 57). Ibn Kathir \uf073 said, explaining this verse, \u201cIt means, punish them severely and massacre them violently so that other enemies from the Arabs and non-Arabs are terrified and those punished and massacred become a lesson for the other enemies \u2018that they might take heed.\u2019\u201dWhen seeking to initiate an attack, it is important to define the objective. One\u2019s attack may be to harvest a large kill count. It may be aimed at disrupting the financial stability of a specific nation. It may simply be aimed at terrorizing the enemies of Allah and depriving them of a peaceful sleep. Accordingly, as the objective of the attack varies, the mujahid must choose a method that best suits the operation at hand.\nExclusive\n\fkufr after Allah saved him therefrom just as he hates being thrown into fire\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Anas). Abu \u2018Abdillah loved Allah and His Messenger more than anything or anyone else. An incident demonstrating this was when he was attending a da\u2019wah road show and stabbed a kafir in the back of the head with a pen for insulting the Prophet \uf067. He did this on a busy street in the heart of Brtian without any care for the consequences of his actions or any fear of the blame of critics, for he understood his duty and knew it was a tremendous honor and privilege to be allowed to defend the Prophet \uf067.\nShortly  after  this  incident,  Abu  \u2018Abdillah  left  for  the blessed land of Sham to join the jihad, despite already having attempted to do so before. Not being content with the life of humiliation, living under the rule of the kuffar, Abu \u2018Abdillah was determined to leave behind his loved ones, along with the rest of the Dunya, to be able to live a life of honor. However, when he arrived in Sham, he did not find himself in the correct company. It was just at the beginning of the Syrian Sahwah and he ended up with the wrong group, a supposedly \u201cIslamist\u201d faction. He became very confused and disheartened as he witnessed the practice of many sins amongst these so-called \u201cmujahidin,\u201d but most importantly, he later saw that the group wasn\u2019t implementing the Shari\u2019ah in the territories over which it had taken control. He was a man who could recognize the truth when he saw it and he clearly saw that these people were upon falsehood.\nHe was disheartened, but he did not lose hope in Allah\u2019s mercy, and after some time, and after traveling back and forth through Dar al-Kufr and facing various tribulations, he finally succeeded \u2013 by Allah\u2019s grace \u2013 in reaching the Islamic State and joining the ranks of its mujahidin. After completing the training camp, Abu \u2018Abdillah was sent to the frontlines for ribat. He was involved in a few battles, including the Islamic State\u2019s wide scale offensive in the northern Halab countryside during the course of which several major towns were liberated. He was a courageous mujahid who would not allow any signs of fear to show on his face or in his voice and actions, and he had full conviction that victory does not rely on numbers or the power of one\u2019s weapons, but rather, in the correctness of one\u2019s \u2018aqidah and in the strength of one\u2019s tawhid.\nHe loved performing ribat, for he understood the great reward found in the perseverance and endurance it requires, with the murabitin sometimes staying in a village for up to a month at a time, keeping guard, with no one around them. During Ramadan, he made much du\u2019a, asking Allah to grant him shahadah in that blessed month, but he did not attain shahadah that year. Little did he know, however, that his du\u2019a had been accepted, inshaallah.\nShortly  after  Ramadan,  he  was  injured,  having  been shot in the ear during a battle in Halab Wilayah, as a result of which he lost his hearing in one ear. Even whilst recovering, he didn\u2019t like to waste time, so he would spend his days memorizing the Quran and giving nasihah to the brothers around him. His eagerness and desire to resume his jihad then led him to joining tasni\u2019 (explosives manufacturing), even though he was still recovering from his injuries.\nOn the first day of working in tasni\u2019, there was a work-re-\nlated explosion at his site. Abu \u2018Abdillah sustained severe burns to his face, neck, chest, and hands. Despite him still being in the recovery process from his previous wound, Allah tested him again with another, more severe injury. The test was very difficult, and he remained in the burn unit for almost two months. The burns he sustained were very intense, especially on his hands, even to the point that all of his fingernails melted off. He became handicapped and was in constant pain, to the point that he would pass out from the intensity of the pain. In the initial stages of the injury, Abu \u2018Abdillah endured a lot of hardship and had to rely upon others to help him do almost everything. He would always apologize and feel as though he was a burden on those close to him, since he was always used to doing things for others.\nThe recovery process was very tough, but Abu \u2018Abdillah remained steadfast and patient, remembering that this was a test and a means of purification from Allah. He was a man who lived for the religion of Allah, and injuries would not stop him from supporting the cause of Allah. Rather, his burns were a constant reminder of Hellfire for him, which is something that Abu \u2018Abdillah would always think about.Abu \u2018Abdillah then began working in da\u2019wah, delivering lectures to the brothers and teaching them the religion, but his heart maintained a strong yearning to return to the battlefield, and this yearning continued to intensify as he witnessed the brothers around him all attaining shahadah one after another. He longed for the same, and after almost one year, Abu \u2018Abdillah finally received permission to join the brothers in Ramadan in the fight against the Crusader coalition forces, although he was still suffering from his injuries and had a shar\u2019i excuse to remain behind. His injuries were not hidden, and those around him could see him constantly banging his hands in order to numb the relentless pain of the new skin growth, and despite his ordeal, he longed to fight for the cause of Allah, to kill and to be killed.\nHe requested to be placed on the list for istishhadi operatives,  as  he  was  determined  to  attain  shahadah  in  the month of Ramadan. This was something he long wished for even back in Dar al-Kufr. He would always say, \u201cImagine on the Day of Judgment you come before Allah having been completely blown to pieces, and then Allah puts you back together and asks you, \u2018Why did you do this to yourself?\u2019 and you answer, \u2018I did this for You, my Lord.\u2019\u201d\nIndeed, an individual\u2019s time and place of death is decreed and destined for him no matter what he plans, and so despite Abu \u2018Abdillah\u2019s efforts to reach the area of Sirrin in Halab Wilayah in order to join the fight against the Crusader coalition forces, and despite his strong desire and intention  to  carry  out  an  istishhadi  operation,  Allah  had something else destined for him. On the 17th of Ramadan 1436AH, and whilst in the city of Raqqah, he was killed by a US drone strike, attaining shahadah thereby in the blessed month for which he prayed. We consider him a shahid and Allah is his judge. May Allah elevate his status and accept him among the siddiqqin and the best of the shuhada, and grant him comfort and tranquility in the gardens of Jannah.\n\f", "schema:headline": "Just Terror Tactics - Part 2", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "9"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah2-The-Shuhada-of-the-Gulshan-Attack", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "2", "schema:articleBody": "8Exclusive\nExclusive\f\u2022 \n\u2022 \nthus readily accessible. They are extremely easy to conceal and highly lethal, especially in the hands of someone who knows how to use them effectively. Also, due to their accessibility, were a person to conduct a campaign of knife attacks, he could dispose of his weapon after each use, finding no difficulty in acquiring another one.\nWhen  choosing  a  knife,  one  should  focus  firstly  on sharpness.  He  should  then  consider  the  strength  of  the blade and handle, and seek something reasonably sized for the job at hand. Also, it should not be too large, making it difficult to conceal, nor lacking a strong grip lest it be easily disarmed. Serrated or partially-serrated blades make for good  combat  knives.\nIt is explicitly advised not to use kitchen knives, as their basic structure is not designed to handle the kind of vigorous application used for assassinations and slaughter.\nSomething important that one should consider before acquiring a knife is to avoid troublesome knives, those that can cause harm to the user because of poor manufacturing. There are certain features that should be avoided when acquiring a knife.\nIf it lacks a guard, which is a protruding piece of metal or other material between the blade and the handle, the wielder may be harmed during the operation, as this guard is to prevent one\u2019s hand from sliding forward onto the blade when plunging it into a victim.\nFolding knives that do not feature a stable locking system should be avoided, for if enough resistance is met on the blade, the folding knife can collapse, cutting the wielder\u2019s own hand.\n\u2022  Knives that have a \u201clockback\u201d or spine lock, which is a locking system on the spine of the handle, are not a good option, for if the person holding the knife squeezes too hard on the handle, the pressure might release the locking system, causing the blade to collapse when plunged into a target.\nThe most reliable knives are fixed blade knives, where the handle and blade are crafted from a single piece of metal. This is characteristically the strongest kind of knife, since the blade extends into the handle without any moving parts.As for choosing a target, then this is just like hunting prey. When carrying out a knife operation, it is not advised to target very large gatherings or overly crowded areas, as this presents a disadvantage and only increases the likelihood of being prevented from achieving kills. Therefore, it is advised that when conducting an operation by oneself, the target should be a smaller crowd, particularly for the one strong in build or skillful in using a knife, as such attacks are proven to inflict terror. Alternatively, for one pursuing a prolonged campaign of terror, he may target lone victims. For example, the target could be a drunken kafir on a quiet road returning home from a night out, or the average kafir working his night shift, or someone walking alone in a public park or rural forested area, or someone by himself in an alley close to a night club or another place of debauchery, or even someone out for a walk in a quiet neighborhood. One should consider canals, riversides, and beaches. It may also help to carry a baton or some other kind of concealable blunt object, such as a baseball bat, to strike the victim\u2019s head with, thereby immobilizing him be-\nfore cutting his throat or stabbing him in other lethal areas to finish him off.\nRegarding  where  on  the  body  the  victim  should  be struck,  then  the  objective  here  is  to  kill  \u2013  so  the  strikes should be aimed at major organs, i.e. the heart, lungs, or main  arteries,  which  run  from  head  to  toe  along  the  inner parts of the body. These include the inner thigh, the groin area, and under the armpits, then extending up the neck. The windpipe can be cut easily by slicing the throat, which is in direct implementation of Allah\u2019s \uf063 command, \u201cSo when you meet those who disbelieve, strike their necks\u201d (Muhammad 4). Due to the hardness of the skull, it is not advised to stab the head. This can risk breaking the knife or causing the blade to become stuck in the skull, thereby making it difficult to extract the weapon.\nAdditionally, it should be stressed that the objective of a knife attack is to attain a reasonable kill count, while equally \u2013 if not more importantly \u2013 to inflict terror on the Crusader citizens of the land in which the operation is carried out. On this basis, the more gruesome the attack, the closer one comes to achieving the desired objective. Nevertheless, it is advised to not necessarily attempt to fully detach the head, as the absence of technique can cause a person to spend a long time attempting to do so, that is, unless the individual\u2019s circumstances and capabilities allow for such. Simply cutting the throat, just as one would slaughter a sheep, is sufficient.\nWhen attacking a victim wearing leather, jeans, or similarly  tough  material,  then  one  should  avoid  striking  the clothed areas. Instead, he should try to strike the exposed skin of the neck, etc. However, if very necessary, a strike with enough force should clear the clothing and penetrate the skin.\nThe psyche of most living creatures, when they perceive a threat, is explained in the concept of \u201cfight or flight.\u201d This practically means that once the assault is initiated, though the target may be injured, he may still attempt to resist. A swift slice across the face should quickly subdue them, as very few people will continue to fight once the smell, feel, and sight of blood becomes apparent. If the target is alone, the  aim  should  be  to  incapacitate  him  as  quickly  and  as silently as possible. This should be followed up with slitting his throat.\nLest the operation be mistaken for one of the many random acts of violence that plague the West, it is essential to leave some kind of evidence or insignia identifying the motive and allegiance to the Khalifah, even if it is something as simple as a note pinned or attached to the victim\u2019s body, or a final testament if the operation will be of a nature where the expected outcome is one\u2019s shahadah.\nThe overall objective of any just terror operation is to bring horror and misery to the enemies of Allah \uf066, and to remind them that their efforts to wage war against Islam and the Muslims will only lead to more and more mujahidin appearing in their very midst, ready to strike them mercilessly on their own soil. So, \u201cLet them find harshness in you\u201d (At-Tawbah 123). And remember that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cNever shall the kafir and his killer be united in the Fire\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah).\n\f", "schema:headline": "The Shuhada of the Gulshan Attack", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "7"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah6-Shedding-Light-on-the-Blessed-Operation-in-Istanbul", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "6", "schema:articleBody": "With  every  act  of  the  mujahidin  that  harms  the mushrikin, the people of kufr and deviance come out with their tongues and pens to alter the details and flip the truth. Their aim is to defame and vilify the muwahhidin, showing them as corrupt sinners who care nothing for the sanctity of life or religion. They weep deceitful tears over a religion in which they have disbelieved and over blood, the likes of which they have shed many times more. Such was the case following the latest attack in Istanbul, in which Islamic State soldiers targeted the mushrikin during one of their  parties,  celebrating  the  European  \u201cNew Year.\u201d As  a  result,  they  filled  the  world  with  noisy  claims that  the  muwahhidin  had  spilled  inviolable  blood and  killed  those  who  should  be  protected. We  will shed some light on various aspects of the situation, so that it will be clear for the Muslims and that the criminals  will  be  exposed.\nWe must not submit to the media of the tawaghit concerning  what  they  release  of  names  of  the  dead and wounded. The evidence, both old and new, is sufficient to establish their deceit in misleading people in this regard. This is like what the tawaghit of Jordan did after the blessed operations in the hotels of \u2018Amman,  where  Crusader  gatherings  of  CIA  agents and murtaddin of the Iraqi Sahwat were targeted. The tawaghit  of  Jordan  hid  this  truth  and  claimed  that the \u201cvictims\u201d were only a group of people celebrating a wedding at the hotel \u2013 those who could have been collaterally hit by the explosive storm of the istishhadi belts while they targeted the Crusaders and murtaddin.\nFitnah Is More Severe than Killing\nAllah  c  said,  \u201cThey  ask  you  about  the  sacred month, about fighting therein. Say, \u2018Fighting therein is a great sin, but averting [people] from the cause of Allah, disbelieving in Him and (denying the sanctity of) al-Masjid al-Haram, and expelling its people therefrom  are  greater  sins  according  to  Allah.  And \nFeature\nfitnah  is  greater  than  killing\u2019\u201d  (Al-Baqarah  217). Ibn Kathir \uf072 commented on the reason this ayah was revealed, saying, \u201cIbn Mas\u2019ud said that Allah\u2019s Messenger  g  dispatched  a  raiding  party  of  seven men led by \u2018Abdullah Ibn Jahsh al-Asadi\u2026 Ibn Jahsh went into a patch of palms and found there al-Hakam Ibn Kaysan, al-Mughirah Ibn \u2018Uthman, \u2018Amr Ibn al-Hadrami, and \u2018Abdullah Ibnul-Mughirah. Ibnul-Mughirah escaped, but al-Hakam Ibn Kaysan  and  al-Mughirah  were  captured,  while \u2018Amr  was  killed  by  Waqid  Ibn  \u2018Abdillah.  They seized  the  first  ghanimah  taken  by  the  Prophet\u2019s g  companions\u2026  So  the  mushrikin  made  a  deceptive allegation, saying, \u2018Muhammad claims to be  obedient  to  Allah,  but  he  is  the  first  to  shed blood in the sacred month, as he killed our people during Rajab.\u2019 The Muslims responded, saying, \u2018We killed them during Jumada,\u2019 and it is said that it was at the very onset of Rajab, meaning the last night of Jumada, and the Muslims sheathed their swords when the month of Rajab started. So Allah rebuked  the  people  of  Makkah,  revealing,  \u2018They ask  you  about  the  sacred  month,  about  fighting \n\fThe murtadd, Erdogan, with his Crusader ally, Putin\na barrier to block Islamic State mujahidin from reaching their lands.\nHowever, whoever scrutinizes the actual situation on the map and the ongoing political events in both Turkey and Sham will recognize that the importance of  this  area  to  the  apostate Turkish  government  far surpasses  the  issue  of  destroying  the  plans  of  the Kurdish state, despite its importance to them. This is because the Turkish army\u2019s assertion of control over some part of Sham will be a means of great pressure on the Nusayri regime in the future, which will exceed the  importance  of  controlling  the  many  factions  of the Sahwah murtaddin \u2013 meaning that they will reap many rewards in a future withdrawal, no matter what kind of taghut government is set up in Damascus.\nLikewise,  Turkey\u2019s  partial  control  over  this  area with  Russian  or  American  air  cover,  would  prevent the Nusayri regime from bombarding it. This would help Turkey  to  eventually  rid  itself  of  a  large  number of undesirable refugees (those who are disruptive or offer little benefit to Turkey) by opening refugee camps for them in this area. Such would also alleviate much of the great costs burdening the declining Turkish  economy.\nThat  is  aside  from  being  able  to  recruit  fighters from these camps to further the future projects of the Turkish army inside Sham. And just as Iran has taken control of the Rafidi militias in the framework of the \u201cRafidi Mobilization,\u201d using it to achieve its goals, so too has Turkey begun speaking about a \u201cSahwah Mo-\nbilization\u201d to be used for serving its interests in Sham and the rest of the region.\nThe Accepted Safe Zone\nWith  every  Crusader-observed  peace  agreement made  between  the  Nusayri  regime  and  the  Sahwah murtaddin,  the  Russians  speak  of  the  necessity  of isolating the \u201cextremists\u201d from the \u201cmoderate opposition,\u201d despite their knowledge of the strong alliance between all of the murtadd Sahwah factions \u2013 whether they openly declare secularism or they falsely claim to  rule  by  Shari\u2019ah.  This  \u201cnecessity\u201d  comes  as  Russian bombers target these \u201cextremists\u201d who refuse to (openly)  negotiate  with  the  Nusayri  regime,  unlike the \u201cmoderates\u201d who have accepted to do so, entrusting  that  to  the  former  Nusayri  prime  minister,  the murtadd  Riyad  Hijab.\nBut such distinction could not happen due to the great mix of these two types of Sahwat, those who accepted the negotiations and those who rejected them, as well as due to the inability of the \u201cmoderates\u201d to expel the \u201cothers\u201d from amongst them. This was clearly manifested in the city of Halab before its complete fall  into  the  hands  of  the  Nusayri  army,  which  was presented by the taghut Erdogan in a way acceptable to  the  Sahwah  murtaddin.  And  by  doing  so,  he  simultaneously  insured  the  Russian-Nusayri  consent for him to build the \u201cSafe Zone,\u201d making it an area for  isolating  the  \u201cmoderate\u201d  Sahwat  from  the  \u201cex-\n\f", "schema:headline": "Shedding Light on the Blessed Operation in Istanbul", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "11"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah2-Important-Memorandums", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "2", "schema:articleBody": "The rulings on those who refrain from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam and those who refrain from making takfir of Sahwah factions who claim jihad are important matters that should be addressed, as they are related to the matter of tawhid and iman, the heart and soul of the religion. Thus, one of the chief offices of the Khilafah \u2013 the Central Office Overseeing Shar\u2019i Dawawin \u2013 addressed the issues in two memorandums, which will be quoted below.\nThe memorandum on the ruling of those who refrain from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam begins by presenting two positions \u201cboth being incorrect due to excess on one hand and negligence on the other,\u201d defining the term \u201casl ad-din\u201d (the foundation of the religion) used in both as \u201cthat by which tawhid is established before the advent of the prophetic proof.\u201dThe first position presented was that \u201cwhoever refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam, is a mushrik exactly like them, because making takfir of them is part of asl ad-din. So the refrainer is exactly  like  those  who  worship  others  besides  Allah, and  he  is  absolutely  one  of  them  in  both  name  and ruling.\u201d\nThe second position presented after was that \u201ctakfir is not part of asl ad-din, but is one of its inferred requirements. So the one who refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam, has not disbelieved until  the  hujjah  (evidenced  argument)  is  established against him, all shubuhat (doubts) are removed, and his tawil (misinterpretation) is eliminated.\u201d\nThe  memorandum  then  explains  that  \u201cthe  first claim implies a corrupt concept, because major shirk has a reality and description that, if actualized, desig-\nnates the one who possesses it a mushrik. If we were to absolutely equate the one who refrains from takfir with the one who worships others besides Allah, then making  takfir  of  the  one  who  refrains  from  making takfir of the refrainer would be absolutely necessitated, since major shirk is not excused by ignorance and the refrainer (according to the first claim) is a mushrik exactly like the initial person [the mushrik worshiping others besides Allah]. And the one who refrains thereafter [from making takfir of the other refrainers in the chain] is also a mushrik [exactly like the initial person], and so on. This is the actual inference \u2013 not an imagined understanding \u2013 of this claim\u2019s line of reasoning. This line of reasoning leads to making chain-takfir, an invalid  bid\u2019ah  that  can  never  be  controlled  and  that originates from an incorrect understanding of the texts. This claim is rejected due to the invalidity of its inference.\u201d\nThe memorandum goes on to explain that \u201cthe second claim also implies a corrupt concept, as it makes takfir of the mushrikin like one of the masail khafiyyah (obscure  issues),  for  which  it  is  impossible  to  establish  the  hujjah  and  impossible  to  make  takfir  of  the refrainer as long as he has some shubhah (doubt) or tawil. The essence of this claim is the annulment of an agreed upon nullifier of Islam. Whereas, the existence of shubhah is a passing matter that must be eliminated\u2026 As for making this passing matter a foundation upon which rulings are based, then this would result in the annulment of these rulings and the nullification of what it means to manifest the religion. This is in opposition to what is transmitted from the imams of the religion, including the imams of the Najdi da\u2019wah \uf073.\u201d\n4Exclusive\nExclusive\fThe aftermath of the Holey Artisan Bakery attack\nAs  the  aircrafts  and  drones  of  the  Crusader  coalition continue to bomb and terrorize the Muslims of Iraq, Sham, Libya,  and  other  wilayat  of  the  Khilafah,  their  Muslim brothers and sisters all over the world read the news with aching pain as the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cThe believers, in their love, mercy, and sympathy, are like one single body. When one of the limbs suffers, the whole body responds to it with insomnia and fever\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from an-Nu\u2019man Ibn Bashir). These Muslims realize that the Crusader leaders who give the orders to brutally bomb the Muslims don\u2019t come from an abstract vacuum; rather, they come into power via the blessings of the constituency of their citizenry, those who partake in their democratic system or accept its results. These Muslims also realize that the huge costs associated with bombs dropped by these aircrafts and drones are largely financed through the tax money generated from the so-called \u201cinnocent civilians\u201d of these democratic nations, those \u201ccivilians\u201d who recognize the legitimacy of policies derived by their democracies, policies including the government spending of tax money on wars waged against Islam and the Muslims. Thus, there remains no doubt in the hearts of these Muslims that the destruction of lives and property in the wilayat of the Khilafah by Crusader jets and drones is to be directly blamed on the purported \u201cpower of the people,\u201d i.e. the power of the socalled \u201cinnocent civilians\u201d of the Crusader nations.1\nAllah \uf063 said, \u201cFight them; Allah will punish them by your hands and will disgrace them and give you victory over them and satisfy the breasts of a believing people and re-\n1   Editor\u2019s Note: Here, the author \uf074 emphasizes that the blood and wealth of adult, Crusader \u201ccivilians\u201d from democratic nations waging war against Islam and the Muslims is more deserving to be spilled than that of other kafir \u201ccivilians,\u201d whose blood is already mubah (permissible) to spill.

And Allah turns in forgiveness to whom He wills; and Allah is Knowing and Wise\u201d (At-Tawbah 14-15). He also said, \u201cAnd fight against the mushrikin collectively as they fight against you collectively. And know that Allah is with the pious\u201d (At-Tawbah 36). \u2018Umar Ibn al-Khattab \uf068 said, after being informed of a murder case, \u201cIf the people of San\u2019a cooperated in his killing, I would have them all killed\u201d (Reported by Malik).Thus, on the night of the 27th of Ramadan 1437, the Soldiers of the Khilafah in Bengal decided to send an inghimasi team of five shahadah knights to the Holey Artisan Bakery restaurant in Gulshan, Dhaka, in order to give the Crusaders a taste of their own medicine. With tawfiq from Allah, the inghimasi brothers were able to kill all the kuffar in the restaurant, kill and wound many of the murtadd Bengali soldiers, and hold the Crusader-owned restaurant under siege for almost 12 hours against hundreds of murtadd Bengali soldiers before achieving shahadah, walhamdulillah.2 We ask Allah to accept them as shuhada and inspire many more muwahhidin in Bengal and in other parts of the world through their deeds. Amin.\nAfter  a  careful  survey  of  several  potential  targets,  the Crusader-owned Holey Artisan Bakery restaurant was selected for this blessed operation because it was well known for being frequented by the citizens of Crusader countries and other kafir nations. It was a sinister place where the Crusaders would gather to drink alcohol and commit vices throughout the night, feeling secure from the wrath of Allah that was awaiting them.\nThe night of the 27th of Ramadan was chosen because of the huge rewards that it could potentially bring to the mujahid  brothers,  as  it  may  possibly  be  Laylat  al-Qadr, \n2   Editor\u2019s Note: The final tally was 24 dead kuffar and murtaddin from America, Italy, Japan, India, and Bengal. The operation also led to the injuring of over 50 murtadd officers and soldiers from Bengal.\n\f", "schema:headline": "Important Memorandums", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah2-The-Religion-of-Islam-and-the-Jama\u2019ah-of-the-Muslims---Part-3", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "2", "schema:articleBody": "In the book of Allah \uf065, there are two verses, the contemplation and implementation of which none whom Allah has blessed forsakes, except that doing so will cause him regret in the Dunya and the Akhirah.

Thus, it encompasses the blessings of the Dunya and the Akhirah. The greatest of Allah\u2019s blessings upon the human being, however, is his guidance to Islam, for without this blessing (the blessing of salamah, meaning sincerity, and istislam, meaning submission to Allah) his chest would be constricted, his life would be filled with depression, and he would strive in deviance.

So the kafir, regardless of his kufr \u2013 whether he is a secularist, communist, Christian, or Jew \u2013 do no hate the muwahhidin except for their untainted iman. Any slogan raised for any battle between us and them, other than the slogan of religion, is an utter lie and deception, for the enmity of the kafir asli [a kafir who was never Muslim and does not claim to be Muslim, like the Jews, Christians, Hindus, and Buddhists] or the murtadd against the muwahhid mujahidin is never based in an economic or political motive. It is only a battle between kufr and iman, a battle of \u2018aqidah, a matter of religion.\nWe do not fight the Crusader occupation or the Arab apostates for the sake of land, but rather, we do so only in order to raise the word of Allah over the land. Likewise, they do not fight us for some disagreement they have with us regarding some financial gains. If that were the case, it would be easier for them and us to find some middle ground and compromise, but we will never allow the sweet rivers that flow in our hearts and pass through our veins to be polluted by the saline seas of their filthy creed and falsehood.\nThe old colonialism was but a front for the Crusaders, just as it is today a front for the Jews and Christians. Indeed, the \u201cCaesar of Rome\u201d Bush has declared multiple times that, \u201cIt is a Crusade!\u201d So why do people lie and deny this?\nIf you know this, O mujahid, then you must not let the  banners  confuse  you  nor  let  the  labels  deceive  you, just as you must purify your heart and ranks from impurities. Beware of letting any shirk or mushrik enter into your  heart  or  ranks.  Likewise,  you  must  know  that  the presence of shirk in the ranks and hearts is an impediment to victory and is the quickest cause for defeat. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cAnd the dhalimin \u2013 they have no ally nor supporter\u201d (Ash-Shura 8), and He said, \u201cAnd the dhalimin have no supporters\u201d (Al-Baqarah 270). The explanation of this is in His \uf066 saying, \u201c\u2018O my son, do not commit shirk with Allah. Indeed shirk is a great dhulm\u201d (Luqman 13).\nThereafter, know that purifying one\u2019s intention for Allah is the most important of factors for victory and consolidation. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cHe knew what was in their hearts, so He sent tranquility upon them and awarded them an imminent conquest\u201d (Al-Fath 18), i.e. what was in their hearts of truthfulness, loyalty, and sincerity of intention by pledging allegiance to Allah, Lord of the creation.\nThis verse thus indicates that sincerity of intention is a  condition  of  consolidation,  and  that  once  sincerity  is present,  Allah  will  give  the  reward  of  conquest,  victory, and consolidation. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cSo whoever hopes to meet his Lord, then he must work righteous deeds and not commit shirk towards anyone in the worship of his Lord\u201d (Al-Kahf  110).  And  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  \uf067  said,  \u201cVerily what I fear most for you is minor shirk\u201d (Reported by Ahmad from Mahmud Ibn Labid). As such, the Prophet \uf067 was very diligent in warning his companions of this threat \u2013 especially in jihad \u2013 lest the threat overtake their hearts. He focused even more, in this regards, on the commanders of jihad, saying, \u201cIndeed, we, by Allah, do not appoint to this work anyone who requested it, nor anyone who hoped to attain it\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim \nThe Crusaders could not handle fighting the mujahidin\nfrom Abu Musa al-Ash\u2019ari).\n\u2018Abdur-Rahman Ibn Samurah said that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said to him, \u201cO \u2018Abdur-Rahman Ibn Samurah, do not request a command position, for if you were given it not due to a request, you would be assisted [by Allah] in it. And if you were given it due to a request, you would be left alone to it\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim). An-Nawawi  said,  \u201cThe  scholars  have  said  that  the  wisdom  behind  not  appointing  someone  who  has  requested  an  appointment  is  that  he  would  be  left  alone  to  it and have no assistance [from Allah], just as the hadith of \u2018Abdur-Rahman Ibn Samurah clearly states. And if he has no assistance, then he is not suitable, and suitability is a requirement for the appointment\u201d (Sharh Sahih Muslim).Likewise,  a  person  could  have  a  good  history  in  his path  towards  Allah  and  jihad  for  Allah\u2019s  sake,  having much good that only Allah knows, but he is not right for a  command  position,  even  if  he  thinks  himself  capable of handling it. Abu Dharr \uf068 said, \u201cI said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, why do you not employ me in a command position?\u2019 So he put his hand on my shoulder and said, \u2018O Abu Dharr, you are weak and this is a trust; and on Resurrection Day, it will be a disgrace and a source of regret\u2019\u201d \n\f", "schema:headline": "The Religion of Islam and the Jama\u2019ah of the Muslims - Part 3", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "13"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah11-The-Ruling-on-Ghanimah,-Fay,-and-Ihtitab", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the creation.

But unlike knives, which if found in one\u2019s possession can be a cause for suspicion, vehicles arouse absolutely no doubts due to their widespread use throughout the world. It is for this obvious reason that using a vehicle is one of the most comprehensive methods of attack, as it presents the opportunity for just terror for anyone possessing the ability to drive a vehicle. Likewise, it is one of the safest and easiest weapons one could employ against the kuffar, while being from amongst the most lethal methods of attack and the most successful in harvesting large numbers of the kuffar.\nAcquiring a vehicle is a simple task regardless of one\u2019s location. However, the type of vehicle and its structural and technical specifications are extremely important factors for ensuring the success of the operation. Observing previous vehicle attacks, it has been shown that smaller vehicles are incapable  of  granting  the  level  of  carnage  that  is  sought. Similarly, off-roaders, SUVs, and four-wheel drive vehicles lack the necessary attributes required for causing a blood bath. One of the main reasons for this is that smaller vehicles lack the weight and wheel span required for crushing many victims. Thus, smaller vehicles are least suitable for this kind of attack. Rather, the type of vehicle most appropriate for such an operation is a large load-bearing truck.\nThe Ideal Vehicle\n\u2022\t Load-bearing truck\u2022\t Large in size, keeping in mind its controlla-\nbility\n\u2022\t Reasonably fast in speed or rate of acceleration (Note: Many European countries pre-restrict larger vehicles to specified speeds)\n\u2022\t Heavy in weight, assuring the destruction of \nwhatever it hits\n\u2022\t Double-wheeled,  giving  victims  less  of  a chance to escape being crushed by the vehicle\u2019s  tires\n\u2022\t\n\u2022\t Possessing a slightly raised chassis (the under frame of the vehicle) and bumper, which allow for the mounting of sidewalks and breeching of barriers if neededIf accessible, with a metal outer frame which are usually found in older cars, as the stronger  outer  frame  allows  for  more  damage  to be caused when the vehicle is slammed into crowds, contrary to newer cars that are usually made of plastics and other weaker materials\nVehicles to Avoid\nhour\n\u2022\t Small cars, including larger SUVs\u2022\t Slower vehicles that cannot exceed 90km per \n\u2022\t Load-bearing trucks with load compartments that  are  not  fixed  to  the  cabin,  which  may cause loss of control and subsequent jackknifing,  especially  if  driven  erratically\n\u2022\t Load-bearing trucks with excessively elongated trailer compartments, which can cause the driver trouble as he seeks to maneuver\nIf one has the wealth, buying a vehicle would be the easiest  option.  Alternatively,  one  could  rent  a  vehicle  or simply ask to borrow one from an acquaintance or relative who owns or has access thereto. For the one not capable of attaining a vehicle by any of these means, there is the option  of  hotwiring  or  carjacking  a  vehicle.  This  is  only recommended for one possessing the know-how or having previous  experience  in  this  domain.\nApplicable Targets\n\u2022\t Large outdoor conventions and celebrations\u2022\t Pedestrian-congested \n(High/Main \nstreets \nstreets)\nAn affordable weapon\n\f", "schema:headline": "The Weakest House Is That of a Spider\r", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3-The-Religion-of-Islam-and-the-Jama\u2019ah-of-the-Muslims-\u2013-Part-4", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "3", "schema:articleBody": "Allah is the Judge, the Rule is His\nIndeed,  the  statement  of  tawhid  (la  ilaha  illallah), which negates ilahiyyah (the right to be worshiped) from all but Allah and affirms it for Allah alone, nullifies all forms of major shirk \u2013 in rububiyyah (lordship), uluhiyyah  (godhood),  and  al-asma  was-sifat  (names  and  attributes)1  \u2013  for  the  ilah  (god)  is  the  one  that  deserves to be worshiped and obeyed due to \u201cthose attributes it possesses necessitating that it be loved with the utmost love and submitted to with the utmost submission\u201d (Taysir al-\u2018Aziz al-Hamid). Thus, whoever does not single out Allah with ilahiyyah in all forms of worship and obedience has nullified the shahadah of tawhid and \u2013 through his actions \u2013 has belied what he claims of belief in the tawhid of rububiyyah and al-asma was-sifat.\nFrom among the different forms of worship that Allah \uf065 has singled out for mention in His Book and in the Sunnah of His Prophet \uf067 is the act of seeking judgment from His legislation alone and ruling by it alone. This is what is necessitated by one\u2019s belief that Allah is \u201cthe most just of judges\u201d (Hud 45) and \u201cthe best of judges\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 57), that there is none more just in word than Allah, that there is none better than Him in judgment, \n1    Tawhid is traditionally categorized by scholars into three categories: rububiyyah, uluhiyyah, and al-asma was-sifat. Tawhid of rububiyyah (lordship) means that there is no Lord but Allah, no one creates except Him, and no one provides the creation with what it needs save Him. This tawhid was recognized by the Arab mushrikin, as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cIf you were to ask them, \u2018Who created the heavens and the earth?\u2019 they indeed would say, \u2018Allah.\u2019 Say, \u2018Then have you considered what you supplicate besides Allah? If Allah intended me harm, are they removers of His harm; or if He intended me mercy, are they withholders of His mercy?\u2019 Say, \u2018Sufficient for me is Allah; upon Him [alone] rely the  [wise]  reliers\u2019\u201d  (Az-Zumar  38).  This  tawhid  did  not  exclude  the mushrikin from takfir nor did it save them from the sword and Hellfire. Allah \uf063 said in this regards, \u201cMost of them believe not in Allah except while they commit shirk\u201d (Yusuf 108), meaning, they believe in rububiyyah but disbelieve in uluhiyyah. Tawhid of uluhiyyah is to worship Allah alone, as none deserves to be worshiped except Him. Tawhid of al-asma was-sifat means that Allah \uf063 has the most beautiful names and loftiest attributes and that He has no equal therein.\nArticle\n\fIbn \u2018Umar). They responded to the command of Allah and His Messenger, being truthful to Allah and His Messenger,  thus  victory  over  their  enemies  came  through truthfulness in listening and obeying and through seriousness when following Allah\u2019s orders.\nThe Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever obeys me has indeed obeyed Allah, and whoever disobeys me has indeed disobeyed  Allah;  and  whoever  obeys  my  emir  has  indeed obeyed me, and whoever disobeys my emir has indeed disobeyed  me\u201d  (Reported  by  al-Bukhari  and  Muslim from  Abu  Hurayrah).\nSome matters that assist in listening and obeying the \nemir include:\nFirst, having good assumptions of the emir, as Allah \uf063 said, \u201cO you who believe! Avoid much assumption, for indeed some assumption is sinful\u201d (Al-Hujurat 12). Thinking well of Muslims in general is an obligation, but doing so with the emir is even more obligatory. There is nothing more harmful to jihad than thinking bad of the emir. How could this not be the case, when such spawns the falsest of speech? Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cBeware of  [bad]  assumptions,  for  indeed  [bad]  assumptions  is the falsest of speech\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurayrah).\nThe author of \u201cFayd al-Qadir\u201d said, \u201cA person\u2019s bad assumption of someone for whom it is not due indicates an absence of uprightness in the person himself, as it is said, \u2018When a person\u2019s deeds are bad, so are his assumptions.\u2019\u201d\nSecond, respecting the emir, as Imam Ahmad reported that Mu\u2019adh said, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 told us of five things for which a person would have a guarantee from Allah \uf062 if he were to do any thereof: Visiting a sick person, following a funeral procession, marching forth as a raider for Allah\u2019s cause, entering upon a leader to honor and respect him, or staying home so that people are safe from him and he is safe from them.\u201d\nHonoring and respecting the emir is by obeying him and  supporting  him,  as  well  as  mentioning  his  good traits, rushing to follow his orders, and advising him privately. Ibn Hajar said, \u201cBeing sincere to the leaders of the Muslims is by helping them with their responsibilities, by reminding them when they overlook [their duties], by mending their mistakes when they err, by calling others to unite with them, and by bringing fleeing hearts back to them\u201d (Fath al-Bari).\nThe fourth cause for victory is patience and steadfastness. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cO you who have believed, persevere, outlast [your enemy] in patience, perform ribat, and fear Allah that you may succeed\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 200). Since this road is long, one must take supplies; and since it is strenuous, burdensome, and full of obstacles, one must have patience and steadfastness. And since jihad is an act of worship,  which  Allah  made  a  duty  upon  us,  we  must rise for it no matter how difficult the trials become and no matter how wearisome it may be. Even if falsehood is widespread and support is scarce, one must press on.Abu  \u2018Ubaydah  Ibn  al-Jarrah  wrote  to  \u2018Umar  Ibn al-Khattab, mentioning to him the mobilization of the Romans and what was feared therefrom, so \u2018Umar wrote \nback to him, saying, \u201cAs to what follows, indeed whatever  befalls  a  believing  slave  of  hardship,  Allah  brings relief  for  him  thereafter.  Indeed,  a  hardship  will  never overwhelm  two  eases.1  Furthermore,  Allah  says  in  His book, \u2018O you who have believed, persevere, outlast [your enemy] in patience, perform ribat, and fear Allah that you may succeed\u2019\u201d (Reported by Malik from Zayd Ibn Aslam).\nAllah \uf063 also said, \u201cWe will surely test you with something of fear, hunger, poverty, death, and lack of food \u2013 and give glad tidings to those who are patient\u201d (Al-Baqarah 155). At-Tabari said, \u201cAllah \uf066 tells the followers of His Messenger \uf067 that He will test them and try them with  hardships  in  order  to  distinguish  those  who  will continue to follow the Messenger from those who will turn back on their heels\u201d (At-Tafsir).\nIn any case, the outcome of patience is good. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cIf you are patient, then it is better for the patient\u201d (An-Nahl 126). So seek Allah\u2019s aid and say as your predecessors from the mujahidin would say. \u201cWhen they came upon Jalut and his troops, they said, \u2018Our Lord! Pour patience upon us, steady our feet, and support us against the kafir people\u2019\u201d (Al-Baqarah 250). And say as the afflicted muwahhidin would say, \u201c\u2018Our Lord! Pour patience upon us and let us die as Muslims\u2019\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 126).2  Thereby,  they  became  pious  shuhada  after  they had been sorcerous kuffar.\nKnow  that  it  is  just  as  the  truthful,  trustworthy Prophet said, conveying the message of the Lord of creation, \u201cthat if the people all convened to benefit you with something,  they  would  never  benefit  you  except  with what Allah has decreed for you, and if they all convened to harm you with something, they would not harm you except with what Allah decreed against you\u201d (Reported by  Ahmad  and  at-Tirmidhi  from  Ibn  \u2018Abbas).  He  also said,  \u201cKnow  that  victory  comes  with  patience,  relief comes  with  suffering,  and  ease  comes  with  hardship\u201d (Reported  by  Ahmad  from  Ibn  \u2018Abbas).\nWhat I want to focus on is something that has been confirmed  through  experience  and  the  athar.  It  is  the great effect of the leadership\u2019s steadfastness, especially in the battlefield and when encountering the enemy. A man asked al-Bara \uf068, \u201cO Abu \u2018Umarah! Did you retreat on the Day of Hunayn?\u201d He answered, \u201cAs for Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067, he did not retreat. Abu Sufyan Ibn al-Harith held to the reins of his mule and when the mushrikin surrounded him, he \uf067 dismounted and said, \u2018I am the Prophet \u2013 no lie \u2013 I am Ibn \u2018Abdil-Muttalib!\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim). In this hadith, there are great benefits that illuminate the path.\nFirstly,  that  the  leadership  was  in  the  battlefield,  at the location of the fight, not far from the area of conflict. It did not move from one country to another, claiming that  it  is  \u201csymbolic\u201d  and  that  with  its  end  the  da\u2019wah would end. As such, the least we request of our brothers is that the emir of the wilayah remains inside his wilayah \n1   Editor\u2019s Note: He is referring to verses 5-6 of Surat ash-Sharh.\n2   Editor\u2019s Note: These were from the words of the repentant, former sorcerers of Pharaoh.\n\f", "schema:headline": "The Religion of Islam and the Jama\u2019ah of the Muslims \u2013 Part 4", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "15"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3-The-Obligation-of-Exposing-Wicked-Scholars", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "3", "schema:articleBody": "There  is  no  doubt  that  protecting  the  religion  is  the greatest  of  priorities.  As  such,  Allah  forbade  shirk  and whatever  leads  to  it.  He  forbade  speaking  about  Him without knowledge. He forbade religious innovations and their causes. Accordingly, it is a duty to warn the Ummah of shirk and bid\u2019ah, proclaim the condition of those who practice and propagate such, and expose their evil and falsehood. This is part of the obligatory nasihah1, to safeguard the religion of Muslims, just as the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cReligion is nasihah.\u201d He was asked, \u201cTo whom?\u201d He said, \u201cTo Allah, to His Book, to His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and their public\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Tamim  ad-Darri).\nLikewise,  refuting  the  people  of  bida\u2019  and  warning against them is a part of commanding virtue and forbidding vice. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cLet there be a group of you who call to good, command virtue, and forbid vice; and those [who do so] are the successful\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 104).\nIbn Taymiyyah \uf072 said, \u201cRegarding the imams of bida\u2019, those who make statements or promote acts of worship at odds with the Quran and the Sunnah, then exposing them and  warning  the  Ummah  against  them  is  obligatory  according  to  all  Muslims\u2026  Because  purifying  Allah\u2019s  path, His religion, His methodology, and His Shari\u2019ah, as well as repelling the deviance and transgression of such people is fard kifayah2 according to all Muslims. If it were not for \nAllah raising individuals to repel the harm caused by such people, the religion would have become corrupted. Its corruption thereby is far worse than the corruption caused by a war-waging enemy seizing the land. This is because when the enemy seizes the land, they do not corrupt the Muslims\u2019 hearts or the religion contained therein, except as an eventual consequence. As for the people of bida\u2019, then they corrupt the hearts initially\u201d (Majmu\u2019 al-Fatawa).\nIt was established in the Sunnah that it is permissible to speak about a wicked man and to fault him, referring to him by his name. The person of bid\u2019ah is the same, and speaking ill of him in order to warn others against him is likewise permissible. \u2018Aishah \uf069 said, \u201cA man sought permission to enter upon Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067, so he said, \u2018Allow him to enter, how wicked a member of his tribe he is.\u2019 When he entered, the Prophet \uf067 spoke kindly to him. After the man left, I said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, you said what you said about him and then you spoke kindly to him?\u2019 He said, \u2018O \u2018Aishah, indeed the worst person on Resurrection Day is he whom others abandon to avoid his wickedness\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).3\nThe Salaf would warn others of taking knowledge from the people of bid\u2019ah, just as Muslim reported in his sahih from Imam Muhammad Ibn Sirin \uf072, who said, \u201cIndeed, this knowledge is religion, so be observant of those from whom  you  take  your  religion.\u201d  He  also  said,  \u201cThey  used \n1      Nasihah  means  \u201csincerity\u201d  and  is  manifested  between  people through giving earnest advice, defending each other, not betraying each other, etc.\n2   An obligation of sufficiency, or fard kifayah, means that as long as a sufficient amount of people fulfill the obligation, the rest of the Ummah is absolved therefrom. But whenever there is not a sufficient \namount of people to engage the obligation, each Muslim who neglects it \u2013 while he is able to fulfill it \u2013 is sinful.\n3   This man was \u2018Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari, the chief of his tribe, who would later join the murtaddin during the War of Riddah. He was captured by Khalid Ibn al-Walid and sent in chains to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, who then accepted his repentance and released him.\nArticle\fthe Muslim making du\u2019a for the defeat of the mushrikin and the victory of the believers.\nThis form of jihad (the jihad through du\u2019a) is more emphasized in the case of those for whom Allah exempted from fighting for His cause, such as women, the ill, the disabled, and the imprisoned. They should all make du\u2019a for the mujahidin, for indeed, when Allah excused the exempted, He did so on condition that they are sincere towards Allah and His Messenger, and this includes making du\u2019a for the allies of Allah, the followers of His Messenger \uf067. Allah \uf063 said, \u201cThere is not upon the weak or upon the ill or upon those who do not find anything to spend any blame if they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger.  There  is  not  upon  the  doers  of  good  any cause [for blame]. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful\u201d (At-Tawbah  91).\nRather,  the  du\u2019a  of  the  weak  is  from  the  most  important  means  of  victory  for  the  Muslims  and  defeating  the  kuffar,  as  the  Prophet  \uf067  said  to  Sa\u2019d  Ibn  Abi Waqqas \uf068, \u201cAre you granted victory or given provision except by means of the weak among you\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari).  In  the  narration  of  an-Nasai,  he  \uf067  said, \u201cIndeed,  Allah  gives  victory  to  this  Ummah  by  means of its weak, through their du\u2019a, their prayers, and their sincerity.\u201d\nIbn  Hajar  said,  \u201cAs-Suhayli  said,  \u2018Jihad  at  times  is done with weapons and at times is done through du\u2019a\u2019\u201d (Fath al-Bari). This is from the apparent and established matters, except that in these days some traumatized defeatists who submitted to the idol of military technology and conceded in advance to the victory of the Crusaders over the Islamic State abandoned du\u2019a, as if it brings no benefit, and Allah\u2019s refuge is sought! This misguided conduct of some people is only due to their ignorance of this weapon, for verily if they knew the importance of du\u2019a, its magnificent effects, its form and etiquettes, and heard stories  of  Allah  answering  the  du\u2019a  of  His  slaves,  they would not have abstained from it nor clung to a means besides it.\nIt is upon the slave to know that du\u2019a contains abundant fruits and numerous virtues that cannot be counted. From among them is that du\u2019a is done in obedience to  the  order  of  Allah  \uf062,  who  said,  \u201cSupplicate  Him, being sincere to Him in religion\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 29), \u201cSupplicate Him in fear and hope\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 56), and \u201cSupplicate your Lord in humility and privately\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 55). Also, it entails the best reliance, humility, and modesty towards Allah \uf063, who said, \u201cYour Lord said, \u2018Supplicate Me; I will respond to you. Indeed, those who disdain My worship will enter Hell [rendered] contemptible\u201d (Ghafir 60). Likewise, it is a means of defending against calamities before they transpire, as the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cNothing averts qadar except du\u2019a\u201d (Reported by Ibn Majah, al-Hakim, and Ibn Hibban). Similarly, it is a means of removing calamities after they have transpired, as he \uf067 said, \u201cCaution will not prevent qadar, and du\u2019a benefits for that which has transpired and for that which has not transpired, and indeed calamity descends and du\u2019a meets it,  so  they  both  engage  each  other  until  Resurrection Day\u201d (Reported by al-Hakim). It is also a means of at-\ntaining what is sought by the du\u2019a. Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cThere is no Muslim who makes a du\u2019a, consisting not of wrongdoing or the breaking of ties, except that Allah with give him one of three things; either He will cause to transpire that for which he was making du\u2019a, or He will save it for him for the Hereafter, or He will avert for him some evil equivalent to it\u201d (Reported by Ahmad and al-Hakim). Therefore, du\u2019a is an enormous matter!Perhaps one of the most important fruits of du\u2019a is that it is a means of steadfastness, victory, and triumph over the enemy, and this is established in the Book and the  Sunnah,  in  mutawatir  form  from  the  life  of  the Prophet \uf067, the lives of his Sahabah \uf06a, and the narrations of the Salaf \uf072. In the story of the battle between Talut  and  his  believing  soldiers,  and  Jalut  and  his  disbelieving  soldiers,  what  did  the  believers  do  then  and what  was  the  conclusion?  Allah  \uf063  said,  \u201cWhen  they went  forth  to  [face]  Jalut  and  his  soldiers,  they  said, \u2018Our Lord, pour upon us patience and plant firmly our feet  and  give  us  victory  over  the  disbelieving  people\u2019\u201d (Al-Baqarah  250).  This  was  a  du\u2019a  that  the  muwahhidin made shortly before and during the course of their battle with the mushrikin, and Allah responded to them immediately. He \uf063 said, \u201cSo they defeated them by the permission  of  Allah\u201d  (Al-Baqarah  251).\nIn the Major Battle of Badr, the night before the battle,  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  \uf067  spent  the  night  praying  and making much du\u2019a while in prostration and asking Allah  for  victory  (al-Bidayah  wan-Nihayah).  On  the  day of Badr, the Prophet \uf067 looked towards his companions, who  numbered  a  little  more  than  three  hundred,  and then  looked  towards  the  mushrikin  and  saw  that  they numbered more than one thousand. Then he faced the qiblah and said, \u201cO Allah, fulfill for me what you promised me. O Allah, bring about what you promised me. O Allah, if you destroy this group from the people of Islam you will not be worshiped on the earth.\u201d Thereupon, he did not cease appealing to his Lord for aid and making du\u2019a to Him until his cloak fell from his shoulders (Reported by Muslim).\nAs for the situation of the Companions on the day of Badr, Allah depicted that they were beseeching Him for aid and making du\u2019a to Him. He said, \u201c[Remember] when  you  asked  help  of  your  Lord,  and  He  answered you\u201d  (Al-Anfal  9).  After  this  du\u2019a  of  the  Prophet  \uf067 and the Companions \uf06a what was the outcome? Allah reinforced  them  with  one  thousand  angels  following one  another,  sent  down  upon  them  tranquility,  planted  firm  their  feet,  overwhelmed  them  with  sleepiness, sent down upon them rain by which He cleansed them and  removed  from  them  the  evil  whispers  of  Shaytan, strengthened their hearts, and cast terror into the hearts of the mushrikin, thereupon the Muslims defeated the mushrikin  by  Allah\u2019s  permission.\nIn  the  Battle  of  Ahzab,  when  the  mushrikin  surrounded Madinah in a severe siege, and hunger, thirst, and  fear  intensified  for  the  Muslims,  and  their  enemy came at them from above them and from beneath them and the people\u2019s hearts reached their throats, the Prophet \uf067 humbly beseeched his Lord and persisted in his du\u2019a. \n\f", "schema:headline": "The Obligation of Exposing Wicked Scholars", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "27"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5-Interview\r-With-the-Amir-of-Hisbah-in-Sinai", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "5", "schema:articleBody": "Question: What is the condition of the Hisbah \nCenter in Sinai Wilayah?\nAnswer: All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the creation.

And how hopeless is what the enemies attempt! Allah \uf063 said, \u201cThey want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah refuses except to perfect His light, although the  disbelievers  dislike  it.

The mujahidin of the wilayah continued to strike \u2013 with their lesser numbers \u2013 the multitudes of  the  disbelievers,  and  continued  to  implement the Shari\u2019ah of Allah as much as they could in all the areas over which they held control.\nAnd despite the war ignited here between Islam and kufr, the centers and offices of the shar\u2019i dawawin (such as the Diwan of Judgment and Grievances, the Diwan of Hisbah, and the Diwan of Da\u2019wah) continue to be active and to do their work on the ground, and all praise is due to Allah.\nAllah has blessed us and facilitated for us here in the Hisbah Center to combat many manifestations of corruption, among the most important of which is the smuggling of  cigarettes,  marijuana,  opiates,  and  other  substances. Likewise, we have prohibited the people from committing open sins and wrongs, such as women not wearing proper hijab, men allowing their clothing to fall below their ankles,  and  the  free  intermingling  of  men  and  women, as well as smoking, music, and satellite dishes, [which are used for broadcasting sinful programs].\nOur main focus, however, is to wage war against the manifestations of shirk and bid\u2019ah, including Sufism, sorcery, soothsaying, and grave-worship.\nQuestion:  Due  to  the  major  role  Sufism  plays  in spreading shirk and bid\u2019ah among the people, and due to Sufi tariqas enslaving the people to the tawaghit, Sufism is one of the worst diseases to have afflicted many lands today. Can you tell us about the condition of Sufism in Sinai?\nAnswer:  Sufism  in  Sinai  is  divided  into  two  major tariqas, the \u2018Alawi-Ahmadi tariqah and the Jariri tariqah.The Ahmadi tariqah is widespread in the region of Jurah and its surrounding areas, such as the areas of Shabbanah, Dhahir, and Malafiyyah, and likewise the region of \n12Interview\nArticle\fout of anger for Allah\u2019s sake and as a deterrent for other sodomites.\nAnd what is obligatory upon an individual concerning matters over which the people have differed, is to refer back to the Book and the Sunnah, Allah \uf063 said, \u201cIn anything over which you disagree \u2013 its ruling is [to be referred] to Allah\u201d (Ash-Shura 10). He \uf063 also said, \u201cIf you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger\u201d (An-Nisa 59).\nThe Sunnah has clarified that the default ruling with respect to burning anything with a soul is that it is forbidden, for Abu Hurayrah \uf068 narrated, saying, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 sent us on an expedition, saying, \u2018If you find so-and-so and so-and-so, burn them with fire.\u2019 Then, when we were about to depart, Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u2018I ordered you to burn so-and-so and so-and-so, but none is to punish with fire except Allah. So if you find them, kill them\u2019\u201d (Reported by alBukhari).\nAnd Ibn \u2018Abbas \uf06b narrated that the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cDo not punish with the punishment of Allah\u201d (Reported by alBukhari).\nAs for the \u201cscholars\u201d of the tawaghit and the \u201ctheorists\u201d of the Sahwat turning a blind eye to the evidences, then this was through their concealment of some of that which the Most Just of Judges had revealed for mankind to maintain their affairs justly. He \uf063 said, \u201cIf you punish [an enemy], punish with an equivalent of that with which you were harmed\u201d (AnNahl 126). He \uf063 also said, \u201cFor [all] violations is legal retribution. So whoever has transgressed against you, then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you\u201d (Al-Baqarah 194). He \uf063 also said, \u201cThe retribution for a harmful act is a harmful one like it\u201d (Ash-Shura 40). He \uf063 also said, \u201cFor wounds is legal retribution\u201d (Al-Maidah 45).\nLikewise, regarding the issue of punishing with fire as an act of retribution, there is the hadith of the \u2018Ukliyyin, which was reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Anas Ibn Malik \uf068, who said, \u201cThat a group of 8 people from \u2018Ukl came to Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 and pledged their Islam. They found the land unpleasant, disliked it, and became ill. They complained of that to Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067, so he said, \u2018Would you like to head out with our shepherd and his camels, and drink from their urine and milk?\u2019 They said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 They then headed out, drank the camels\u2019 urine and milk, and recovered. Then they killed the shepherd and drove the camels out, [stealing them]. This then reached Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067, so he sent after them and they were captured and brought back. He then gave the order and their hands and feet were cut off, and he melted their eyes [In one narration: He then called for some nails to be brought. The nails were then heated. And he melted their eyes with them]. They were then cast out and left under the [heat of the] sun, until they died.\u201d\nAnas \uf068 said, \u201cThe Prophet \uf067 only melted their eyes because they melted the shepherds\u2019 eyes\u201d (Reported by Muslim).\nAl-Bukhari named a chapter in his sahih on the hadith of the \u2018Ukliyyin, \u201cChapter: If a Mushrik Burns a Muslim Is He to Be Burned?\u201d Ibn Hajar said, \u201cHe thereby indicated that the prohibition in his statement, \u2018Chapter: The Punishment of Allah Is Not to Be Punished With,\u2019 is specific to when the burning is not done for the sake of retribution\u201d (Fath al-Bari), because the reality of melting a person\u2019s eyes is to burn the \nThe two Turkish apostates in the clutches of the mujahidin\neyes with fire using heated nails as a medium, as was indicated by Ibnul-Muhallab, Ibn Battal, Ibnul-Mulaqqin, and other hadith commentators.\nThus, in these ayat, the Most Just of Judges legislated retribution, and in this hadith, the truthful and trustworthy one \uf067 judged that the eyes of the \u2018Ukliyyin be melted because some of them did the same to the eyes of his shepherd. These evidences attest to the just nature of the flames that the mujahid muwahhidin ignited for the imprisoned soldiers of the Jordanian and Turkish tawaghit. Likewise, the position of the majority of the fuqaha also bears witness to the just nature of these flames.\nAbul-\u2018Abbas  al-Qurtubi  commented  on  the  hadith  reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Anas \uf068, who narrated, saying, \u201cA Jew killed a young girl for the sake of some silver jewelry she had, using a stone. She was brought to the Prophet \uf067 while she still had some life in her [before dying]. He asked her, \u2018Was it so-and-so who killed you?\u2019 So she shook her head, \u2018No.\u2019 Then he asked her about a second person, and she shook her head, \u2018No.\u2019 Then he asked her about a third person, and she nodded her head, \u2018Yes.\u2019 So Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 killed him [by crushing his head] between two stones.\u201d\nAbul-\u2018Abbas Al-Qurtubi said, \u201cTherein is [evidence] that whoever commits murder using something is to likewise be killed by it. There was a difference of opinion on the issue, and the majority hold that he is to be killed with the like of that by which he committed the murder, whether by a stone, a cane, drowning, strangling, etc., as long as he did not commit murder with something entailing fisq, such as sodomy or alcohol, in which case he is to be killed by the sword. Their evidence is this hadith, as well as His \uf063 statement, \u2018So whoever has transgressed against you, then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you\u2019 (Al-Baqarah 194), and His \uf063 statement, \u2018For wounds there is qisas\u2019 (Al-Maidah 45), and the reality of qisas [retribution] is to be equal in deed. And from among these scholars [i.e. the majority] are those who differed when it came to burning with fire or killing him with a cane [i.e. by impaling him through the anus, if he had \n\f", "schema:headline": "Interview\r With the Amir of Hisbah in Sinai", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "11"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah12-Contents", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "12", "schema:articleBody": "CONTENTS\nISSUE 12 - DHUL-QA\u2019DAH 1438\nO MUWAHHIDIN, REJOICE, FOR BY ALLAH, WE  WILL  NOT  REST  FROM  OUR  JIHAD EXCEPT  BENEATH  THE  OLIVE  TREES  OF RUMIYAH ABU HAMZAH AL-MUHAJIR r\n(ROME).\n06\n04\nFOREWORD\nARTICLES\n061018243236\nNEWS\n36\n10\n36\nTHE MUSLIM SOCIETY BETWEEN HUMAN REALITY AND MISLEADING FANTASIES\nA MUJAHID\u2019S MEMORIES FROM THE BATTLE OF MOSUL\nRULINGS RELATED TO GIVING DA\u2019WAH TO THE HARBI KUFFAR\nIMPORTANT ADVICE FOR THE MUJAHIDIN: PART IT WILL BE A FIRE THAT BURNS THE CROSS AND ITS PEOPLE IN RAQQAH\nTHE FEMALE SLAVES OF ALLAH IN THE HOUSES OF ALLAH\nMILITARY AND COVERT OPERATIONS\nCONTENTS\fHere,  we  present  to  you  \u201cA Mujahid\u2019s  Memories  from  the Battle  of  Mosul,\u201d  an  article that  illustrates  the  brutal  war in  the  heart  of  Mosul,  which transformed doctors and medical assistants into soldiers and heroes who were prepared to sacrifice in defense  of  their  religion.\nAs  for  the  Battle  of  Raqqah, the Crusaders and their murtadd proxies  claimed  that  they  are capable  of leading  the  battle without  losing  large  numbers  of soldiers  and  without  sustaining losses  and  defeats.  They  also claimed that they would \u201cliberate\u201d Raqqah  in  a  span  of  time  that does  not  exceed  a  number  of weeks, but they will suffer failure and  disappointment,  and  they will  incur  losses  \u2013  with  Allah\u2019s permission  \u2013  and  will  then  be filled  with  regret.\nRAQQAH \u2013 THE COALITION DOESN\u2019T LIBERATE CITIES\u2026IT DESTROYS THEM\nAnd  in  this  regard,  we  present  to  you  an interview with the military commander for Raqqah Wilayah,  who  talks  about  the  ongoing  battle  in Raqqah Wilayah and how it is being administered.In  another  part  of  the  world,  the  soldiers  of the Khilafah have proven once again \u2013 this time in  Marawi  \u2013  that  there  are  no  borders  when establishing  the  Islamic  State,  and  that  the determination to reside under Allah\u2019s shari\u2019ah and raise His word is not something restricted to any particular  time  or  place.\nAnd  as  long  as  the  Book  of  Allah  remains  in the  breasts  of  those  seeking  its  implementation, then let the kuffar be prepared to confront armies marching  forth  in  order  to  shed  their  blood.\nThe  example  of  our  brothers  in  Marawi  is present in every land: It is present in the Arabian Peninsula,  Morocco,  Algeria,  Tunisia,  Turkistan, and even Malaysia, and the banner of the Islamic State will flutter fly in every part of the world \u2013 with  Allah\u2019s  permission  \u2013  even  if  the  enemies  of Allah and the enemies of the believers hate that. And  there  is  no  ability  or  strength  except  with Allah.\nIn  this  issue,  we  begin  with  an  article  titled, \u201cThe  Muslim  Society  between  Human  Reality \nand  Misleading  Fantasies,\u201d  which  gives  us  a glimpse at the society established by the Prophet g and his companions. This society did not stop with the establishment of Allah\u2019s shari\u2019ah and the implementation of the hudud alone. Rather, it was a society that called to good and clarified the path to  forgiveness.\nAnd  in  the  article  titled,  \u201cRulings  Related  to Giving  Da\u2019wah  to  the  Harbi  Kuffar,\u201d  we  clarify matters  related  to  giving  da\u2019wah  to  the  harbi (belligerent) kuffar both before fighting them and during  the  fighting.\n\u201cThe Female Slaves of Allah in the Houses of Allah - Rulings and Etiquettes\u201d is an article that clarifies  what  is  obligatory  for  women  to  know before  they  head  out  to  the  masajid.\nFinally,  we  present  to  you  \u201cImportant  Advice for  the  Mujahidin:  Part  2,\u201d  where  we  mention the  advice  of  Abu  Mus\u2019ab    az-Zarqawi  r  to  the mujahidin  in  Allah\u2019s  cause.\nWe  ask  Allah  to  preserve  all  those\u2013  both  far and near \u2013 who contributed to the success of this issue.\n5Rumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Contents", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "1"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah10-Important-Memorandums", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "The  Delegated  Committee  issued  an  important memo to the soldiers of the Islamic State entitled, \u201cThat Those Who Perish would Perish upon Proof and Those Who Live would Live upon Proof,\u201d which confirms some matters regarding the \u2018aqidah of the Islamic  State  and  its  methodology.  It  also  refutes some  opinions  and  decisions  that  have  been  ascribed  to  the  State,  warning  people  from  making claims  about  the  Islamic  State  without  knowledge and ascribing opinions and beliefs to it without evidence. And it clarifies to the Muslims the way of Ahlus-Sunnah in giving advice to those in authority and  dealing  with  grievances  whenever  appear.\nThe memo, which was published on the 21st of Sha\u2019ban 1438, began by explaining that the Islamic State was only established to spread tawhid, and that its da\u2019wah is merely an extension of the da\u2019wah of the Prophets and Messengers \uf070, then that of the righteous Salaf of this ummah and of those who followed their guidance. It also confirmed that it was established upon the same principles as the blessed Najdi da\u2019wah state founded by the followers of the Mujaddid  Imam  Muhammad  Ibn  \u2018Abdil-Wahhab r.\nThe Islamic State Remains upon Its Manhaj\nNeither Changed nor Replaced, by Allah\u2019s Grace\nThe memo clarified that the Islamic State is still firm  upon  its  \u2018aqidah,  which  has  not  changed  nor was  it  replaced,  since  its  first  bricks  were  laid  by Shaykh  Abu  Mus\u2019ab  az-Zarqawi  r  and  his  noble brothers, as it was after them in the state of Shaykh Abu \u2018Umar al-Baghdadi and his wazir Abu Hamzah al-Muhajir \uf074, until the Khilafah upon the prophetic  methodology  returned  under  the  leadership  of Amirul-Muminin  Shaykh  Abu  Bakr  al-Baghdadi \uf085. As it was mentioned in the Delegated Committee\u2019s memo, \u201cThe State did not change its manhaj. It did not haggle over its religion. And its resolve did not waver. Instead, it continued thereon, not playing favorites nor turning from the path.\u201d And the memo confirmed that the State doesn\u2019t care who is pleased or displeased with it, but that it instead deals with everyone based on its chosen method, just as Shaykh Abu Muhammad al-\u2018Adnani \uf08a said, \u201cWe will fight, and fight, and fight until the religion is entirely for Allah. We will never beg people to accept the religion of Allah and to rule by Allah\u2019s Shari\u2019ah. Who-\n12EXCLUSIVE\nEXCLUSIVE\fDuring  times  of  war,  tribulations,  and  hardship, worries  abound  and  hearts  reach  the  throats.  Some people are supported by Allah through their iman and their good assumption of Allah, while others perish, turning back on their heels, regressing from their religion, and betraying their brothers. Rather, one finds that  many  of  these  are  not  satisfied  with  their  own defeat, but attempt to transfer that defeat to others, spreading it throughout the Muslim collective. They dismay them regarding their enemies, seeking to scare the Muslims and avert them from fighting them and standing up against them.\nThis  is  one  of  the  well-known  deeds  of  the  munafiqin, and it is widespread between those weak in iman  and  lacking  in  conviction,  of  both  men  and women.  As  for  the  matter  of  men,  then  it  is  well known,  and  their  role  has  already  been  thoroughly discussed. And as for women, then the calamity that comes from them is hidden in their transporting this scaremongering from the houses and tongues of the munafiqin to their own houses, and to their husbands and children. Thereby, she falls into committing the deeds of the munafiqin, whether she knows it or not.\nIrjaf is an Act of the Munafiqin\nNews that is untrue and causes fitnah and confusion is called irjaf, or scaremongering. Al-Qurtubi said in his tafsir, \u201cIrjaf is to solicit fitnah and to spread lies \nand falsehoods, causing worry and distress thereby.\u201d\nAllah c has dispraised irjaf and its people in many places in the noble Quran, as He c said, \u201cAllah already knows the hinderers among you and those (hypocrites) who say to their brothers, \u2018Come to us,\u2019 and they do not go to battle, except for a few\u201d (Al-Ahzab 18). He also said, \u201cIf the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease and those who spread rumors in Madinah do not cease, We will surely incite you against them; then they will not remain your neighbors therein except for a little. (They will be) accursed wherever they are found, being seized and massacred completely\u201d  (Al-Ahzab  60-61).\nAl-Jassas said, \u201cIn this ayah, there is evidence that scaring  the  believers  and  spreading  rumors  among them  that  cause  them  worry  and  harm  is  deserving of punishment and exile if they persist in that and do not stop. A group of the munafiqin and others who had no insight in the religion, and they are those in whose hearts is disease, being weak in their certainty, would spread rumors of the kuffar and mushrikin gathering together, cooperating with one another, and marching towards the believers. They would magnify the  kuffar\u2019s  situation  and  scare  others  because  of  it. So Allah c revealed that about them, telling about their deserving exile and execution if they do not stop. And He c explained that this is the sunnah of Allah, which is the way ordained to adhere to and follow\u201d (Ahkam  al-Quran).\nSOME FOOLS WHO STRAYED AND RETURNED TO DAR AL-KUFR BEGAN SPREADING IRJAF\nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Important Memorandums", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "11"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah13-Foreword", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "13", "schema:articleBody": "FOREWORD\nA n  official  from  among  the \nCrusaders  commented  on the matter of their targeting the soldiers of the Islamic State, saying, \u201cThey have entered into war, and they should expect that their deaths will be one of the outcomes.\u201d\nIndeed,  the  statement  that  Allah g  placed  on  the  tongue  of  this  kafir is  a  truth  that  cannot  be  argued, particularly  with  the  soldiers  of  the Islamic State. In fact, the reality is that when  the  mujahidin  proceed  towards battle, death is not just a possibility for them,  it  is  a  wish  that  they  seek  and endeavor  to  attain,  for  death  in  this case is shahadah in the cause of Allah, and through it the believer attains the highest  of  ranks  with  the  Lord  of  the heavens and the earth.\nHowever, it seems that the Crusaders \nhave  yet  to  grasp  the  reality  of  what  was  stated  by  one  of their  officials,  and  for  this  reason  we  find  them  displaying a significant degree of surprise and shock whenever they are attacked in their lands by the soldiers of the Islamic State. It is as if they live in another world altogether, different from the one in which their armies are engaged in a grinding war against  the  army  of  the  Islamic  State,  exerting  their  efforts in order to destroy the lands of Islam and to kill as many of the women and children of the Muslims \u2013 both young and old \u2013 as they can.\nThis  is  not  the  first  time  that  the  Crusader  states  have been led to war by America \u2013 the carrier of the banner of the Cross in this era \u2013 and neither is it the first time that they have paid a heavy price for following their tawaghit in their war against the Muslims.\nWhat  is  apparent  is  that  whenever  the  tawaghit  of  the European  states  dispatch  their  armies  to  fight  and  kill  the Muslims  under  America\u2019s  banner,  they  only  calculate  the gains they will achieve by taking part in that war and forget to gauge the heavy cost they will be forced to pay in order to achieve the gains that they dream of.\nFOREWORD\fJahiliyyah affirmed the oneness of Allah in His Lordship, they negated that affirmation with their indulgence in various  forms  of  shirk  that  run  contrary  to  the  three described aspects of Allah\u2019s tawhid (ar-Rububiyyah, alUluhiyyah, and al-Asma was-Sifat).\nAnd Most of Them Believe Not in Allah Except \nThat They Associate Others with Him\nAllah g informed that if the kuffar were asked, \u201cTo whom belongs the earth and those upon it?\u201d They would answer,  \u201cTo  Allah,\u201d  and  if  they  were  asked,  \u201cWho  is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the great throne?\u201d They would answer, \u201c[They belong] to Allah,\u201d and if they were asked, \u201cWho is it that has the realm of all things in His Hand and who protects while none can protect against Him?\u201d They would answer, \u201c[They belong] to Allah.\u201d But despite that, they would not be reminded, nor would they fear Allah and His torment! And despite their affirmation that Allah g is the Owner of the dominion, the Creator, the Arranger, the Provider, the one who gives life and death, they commit shirk with Him by associating others with Him, while affirming that everything besides Allah is but mere creation. \u2018Abdullah Ibn \u2018Abbas h narrated, saying, \u201cThe mushrikin used to say, \u2018We respond to You, You have no partner,\u2019 and the Messenger of Allah  g would say, \u2018Woe to you, that\u2019s sufficient, that\u2019s sufficient! Then, they would say, \u2018Except a partner who belongs to You, You possess him and all that he owns.\u2019 They would say this as they performed tawaf around the Ka\u2019bah\u201d (Reported by Muslim).\nDespite  the  fact  that  the  mushrikin  used  to  take shelter with Allah in times of difficulty, in times of ease they would return back to what they were accustomed to of committing shirk with Allah. Allah g said, \u201cAnd when they board a ship, they supplicate Allah, sincere to Him in religion. But when He delivers them to the land, at  once  they  associate  others  with  Him\u201d  (Al-\u2019Ankabut 65). They committed shirk with Allah in their worship of others besides Him, calling upon others besides Him who  cannot  bring  harm  nor  benefit,  directing  various forms of worship towards the tawaghit, referring to them in judgement, and inventing against Allah lies with their statement, \u201cWe only worship them that they may bring us nearer to Allah in position\u201d (Az-Zumar 3).\nAllah g sent His messengers and prophets calling to iman in Allah and to dedicating one\u2019s worship exclusively for Him, and to disbelieve in all of the tawaghit, for the iman of mankind and jinn is not complete until they combine  between  these  two  matters:  Iman  in  Allah \nand disbelief in the tawaghit. Allah g said, \u201cAnd We certainly  sent  into  every  nation  a  messenger,  [saying], \u2018Worship Allah and avoid taghut.\u2019 And among them were those whom Allah guided, and among them were those upon whom error was [deservedly] decreed. So proceed through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers\u201d (An-Nahl 36). Therefore, anyone who refuses to dedicate their worship exclusively to Him, or refuses to avoid the tawaghit and disbelieve in them is a misguided denier of Allah\u2019s messengers, and is deserving of Allah\u2019s punishment, which He inflicts upon the disbelievers.\nThe messengers p made it clear that Allah does not accept from His slaves anything except pure Islam and absolute tawhid, and they therefore informed the people that  they  were  not  sent  except  to  ensure  that  Allah  is worshiped  alone,  as  Allah  g  said,  \u201cAnd  We  sent  not before you any messenger except that We revealed to him that, \u2018There is no god except Me, so worship Me\u2019\u201d (AlAnbiya 25), and they informed them that Allah g, \u201cDoes not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills\u201d (An-Nisa 48). And when the kuffar proposed to the Prophet g that they worship Allah for one year in return that he g worship their false gods for one year, Allah g revealed Surat alKafirun, separating between iman and its adherents, and shirk and its adherents. \u201cSay, \u2018O disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship. Nor are you worshipers of what I worship. Nor will I be a worshiper of what you worship. Nor will you be worshipers of what I worship. For you is your religion, and for me is my religion\u2019\u201d (AlKafirun 1-6).\nThe Tawhid of Allah in Hukm (Legislation and \nRule)\nThe  messengers  p  made  clear  to  their  people  that which Allah loves and is pleased with of tawhid, iman, and righteous deeds, while warning them against that which negates this from the various types of kufr, shirk, defiance, and disobedience. And from among that which they made extremely clear was the matter of rule being for  Allah  g.  Therefore,  just  as  Allah  g  is  alone  in creating He is likewise alone in His command. \u201cHis is the creation and the command; blessed is Allah, Lord of the creation\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 54). Additionally, three Makki verses were revealed stipulating that \u201cLegislation is not but for Allah\u201d (Al-An\u2019am 57, Yusuf 40, and Yusuf 67). And despite the fact that the Prophet g and his companions were  oppressed  in  Makkah,  Allah  g  ordered  him  to openly declare that this great religion came from Allah \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "Foreword", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah9-They-Took-Their-Scribes-and-Monks-as-Lords-besides-Allah", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "9", "schema:articleBody": "Article\n\fAlhambra, a Muslim fortress in Andalus that fell to the kuffar after the Muslims became divided\none can overcome you; but if He should forsake you, who is there that can aid you after Him?

He said, and His word is the truth, \u201cOr do you think that you will enter Jannah while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on  before  you?  They  were  touched  by  poverty  and hardship and were shaken until [even their] messenger and those who believed with him said, \u2018When is the help  of  Allah?\u2019  Unquestionably,  the  help  of  Allah is  near\u201d  (Al-Baqarah  214).  And  indeed  the  Sunnah of  Allah  requires  that  victory  will  not  be  achieved without uprightness upon His c orders and through sincerely  returning  to  Him,  so  whoever  is  most supportive to the religion of Allah, and the greatest in his jihad against His enemies, and the most upright in his obedience to Allah and His Messenger, then he is indeed greatest in support, obedience, and sanctity.O  ummah  of  Islam,  time  has  passed  and  today history is repeating itself. It is a scene that resembles the situation of Dar al-Islam in previous times since generations passed and great events raged, leaving an \neffect that could not be erased and a deep wound in the body of the Ummah that would not heal. But it is a lesson from those who preceded and a means of distancing the Muslim jama\u2019ah from a slippery slope and an abyss that may lead them to actual destruction by  stripping  them  of  their  religion,  such  that  they perish  upon  other  than  the  religion  of  Islam.  So here is Crusader America and its allies returning in an  attack  against  Dar  al-Islam  and  the  land  of  the Khilafah, and it has not occurred in history that the nations of kufr gathered with all their religions and creeds,  in  collusion  with  those  falsely  attributing themselves  to  Ahlus-Sunnah,  from  the  murtadd rulers and the evil scholars and callers \u2013 even those claimants to jihad and a sound manhaj \u2013 all of them in one rank with the nations of kufr against the sons of  Islam  in  the  Khilafah  state.  Nevertheless,  the difference between that past period and invasion and what  we  are  experiencing  today  is  that  the  Muslim state of those old times was in the worst of conditions, distant from its religion and its Lord, divided by the kings of the taifas,1  so Allah empowered an enemy that  swept  into  the  homes,  destroying  both  hearth and offspring. As for today, and despite the severity of the assault and the raging struggle from the East and  the  West  against  Dar  al-Islam,  the  situation  of \n1 The taifas, or tawaif, were the divisions that appeared after the fall of the Khilafah in Andalus during the fifth century after the Hijrah.\n\f", "schema:headline": "They Took Their Scribes and Monks as Lords besides Allah", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "21"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq9", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah13-The-Characteristics-of-the-Munafiqin", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "13", "schema:articleBody": "Nifaq (hypocrisy): It is an incurable internal \ndisease, in which a man may be filled with it while he is oblivious, for it is a matter hidden from the people, and frequently it can lead to a person thinking he is a doing right while in fact he is spreading corruption.\nIt is of two types: Major and minor.

Six months had  passed  and  it  was  \u201cDecember  2013\u201d  when  he told me, \u201cI am confirming to you my allegiance to the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Sham.  I  have  given bay\u2019ah to its amir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi al-Husayni al-Qurashi.  We  are  anticipating  betrayal  from  the other  factions  and  we\u2019re  speculating  a  propaganda war. Jabhat an-Nusrah aren\u2019t what we thought them to be. Dawlah are the true mujahidin. They are not fighting  for  democracy  or  nationalism,  they  are fighting to implement Shari\u2019ah!

However,  on  route  they too were ambushed by the thugs of \u2018Liwa at-Tawhid\u2019. The mujahidin were drawn into a battle and within half an hour my previous husband had been fatally struck  by  a  bullet  in  the  jaw.  The  brothers  swiftly sheltered him away from the enemy\u2019s line of fire and \na few minutes later he had proclaimed his shahadah and returned to his Lord, inshaallah in the heart of a green bird with a lantern hanging from the throne of Allah g.\nThe news was bittersweet. I was so happy for my previous husband \u2013 may Allah accept him \u2013 as Allah g had not denied him his desire to attain shahadah \u2013 we consider him so and Allah is his judge \u2013 but I was anxious because I now had to make hijrah with my children, alone.\nThe Murtaddin Are Exposed and the \nMujahidin Remain True\nIt  was  not  long  before  Allah  g  exposed  the Sahwat.  They  were  allying  with  the  kuffar  and tawaghit,  receiving  funds  and  various  other  forms of assistance. They did not implement the Shari\u2019ah in  any  of  the  places  where  they  had  tamkin (consolidation), nor did they bring peace and security to  the  Muslims.  Rather,  tyranny  and  oppression remained widespread. Meanwhile, the Islamic State had  liberated  Raqqah  and  numerous  other  cities throughout Sham and implemented the Shari\u2019ah in all  their  strongholds.  However,  this  did  not  deter the claimants to Islam and jihad from defaming and belittling  the  mujahidin,  condemning  their  actions in  order  to  appease  the  kuffar,  and  accusing  the Islamic  State  of  hijacking  Islam  when  in  reality  it was those social media-obsessed entertainers we call \u201cscholars\u201d who have hijacked and distorted our pure religion  by  encouraging  voting  in  kufri  elections, embracing  peaceful  co-existence  with  the  kuffar, accepting the rule of the tawaghit, and by other than \nRumiyah\f", "schema:headline": "The Characteristics of the Munafiqin", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "25"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq4", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah1-Stand-and-Die-upon-That-for-Which-Your-Brothers-Died", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "1", "schema:articleBody": "The people of falsehood constantly attempt to make the deaths of righteous men and their slayings by the enemies of Islam \u2013 the mushrikin and the apostates \u2013 into a sign foretelling the breaking of the muwahiddin.

In this decree,  all  people  are  equal,  including prophets and righteous people as well as  disbelievers  and  tyrants.\nThose fools do not realize that Allah \uf063 preserves His religion however He wills, and this religion will remain established and will not be damaged by \nthe death of any person. If it would have  been  damaged  by  anything, it  would  have  been  by  the  death  of the Prophet \uf067 and those of his noble  Companions.  But  the  religion remained  long  after  their  departure, as Allah established its foothold and spread it on the earth. He preserved it and employed His righteous slaves in its service. \u201cHe loves them and they love  Him;  humble  to  the  believers and  mighty  against  the  disbelievers, they  wage  jihad  for  His  cause  and do not fear the blame of any blamer\u201d (Al-Maidah  54).\nAs for the learned who revere Allah as He should be revered, worshiping Him  as  He  should  be  worshiped, when  one  of  the  righteous  from among  them  die,  they  remind  their \n2\fHe \uf072 also said, \u201cThe Islam which is the religion of Allah and for which He revealed His books and sent His messengers \u2026 is that the slave surrenders to Allah, the Lord of the creation, submitting (istislam) to Him alone without making any partners for Him, and becoming exclusively for  Him  (salamah)  such  that  he  takes  Him  as  his  deity without taking other than Him as a deity, as is clarified by the best of speech and the main pillar of Islam, the testimony of \u2018la ilaha illallah.\u2019 And it has two opposites: kibr [haughtiness] and shirk. For this reason, it was reported that Nuh \uf06e ordered his sons with \u2018la ilaha illallah\u2019 and \u2018subhanallah,\u2019 and forbade them from arrogance and shirk (Reported by Ahmad from \u2018Abdullah Ibn \u2018Amr) \u2026 This is because the one who is too haughty to worship Allah does not worship Him and therefore does not submit to Him, and the one who worships Him and also worships other  than  Him  is  making  partners  for  Him  and  he  is therefore not exclusively for Him. Rather, he has shirk towards Him. And the word \u2018Islam\u2019 comprises both istislam and salamah, meaning ikhlas\u201d (Al-Fatawa), \u201cand both the mustakbir [the haughty person who does not worship Allah] and the mushrik are not Muslims\u201d (An-Nubuwwat).\nThus,  a  person  cannot  be  a  Muslim  except  by  adhering to Islam in both of these aspects, so whoever doesn\u2019t submit to Allah \u2013 such as one who abandons all actions or forcefully resists some of the manifest, mutawatir rulings \u2013 is nothing but a kafir, and whoever isn\u2019t exclusively for Allah \u2013 such as one who worships the prophets and the  righteous,  whether  blindly  following  others  or  having misunderstandings \u2013 is nothing but a mushrik, even if he prays, fasts, and claims that he is a Muslim. These realities are manifested by the testimony of \u201cla ilaha illallah.\u201d Abul-\u2018Abbas Ibn Taymiyyah \uf072 said, \u201cThe \u2018ilah\u2019 is the one who is worshiped and obeyed\u201d deserving so (Taysir al-\u2018Aziz al-Hamid), thus there is none deserving worship or  obedience  except  Allah.  This  statement  encompasses the meanings of both salamah and istislam, and it is the da\u2019wah of all the prophets and messengers to their peoples and  nations.\nAbul-\u2018Abbas  Ibn  Taymiyyah  \uf072  said,  \u201cThe  word  \u2018Islam\u2019\u2026has two meanings. The first is the common religion which He sent all the prophets with \u2013 to worship Allah alone, not making any partners for Him \u2013 as the texts of the Book and the Sunnah indicate that their religion was the same. The second meaning is that which Muhammad \uf067 was specified with \u2026 And it (i.e. Islam) has two levels. The first level is those words and deeds manifested externally, and they are the five pillars. The second level is that this  manifestation  conforms  with  one\u2019s  interior\u201d  (Al-Fatawa).\nThese five pillars, which represent the reality of Islam in speech and action, both outward and inward, were clarified by Allah\u2019s messenger \uf067 through his statement, \u201cIslam has been built upon five matters: Testifying that there is no  god  but  Allah  and  that  Muhammad  is  His  messenger, establishing the prayer, giving the zakah, performing hajj to the sacred house, and fasting Ramadan\u201d (Report-\ned by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar). Another narration states, \u201cIslam has been built upon five matters: Making tawhid of Allah\u2026\u201d (Reported by Muslim from Ibn  \u2018Umar).  Another  narration  states,  \u201cIslam  has  been build upon five matters: Worshiping Allah and disbelieving  in  anything  [worshiped]  besides  Him\u2026\u201d  (Reported by Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar). Thus, the Islam with which the Shari\u2019ah of Muhammad \uf067 was specified was not an Islam without salamah and istislam to Allah. Rather, the five pillars were legislated so that the individual could become exclusively for Allah and submit to Him by adhering to tawhid, following the Messenger \uf067, and performing the  pillars.  Ishaq  Ibn  Rahawayh  \uf072  said,  \u201cThe  Murjiah went to extremes to the extent that one of their statements became,  \u2018Whoever  abandons  the  prayer,  the  fast  of  Ramadan, the zakah, the hajj, and abandons all other obligations, without denying their obligatory status, we do not make takfir of him and his matter is deferred to Allah thereafter since he acknowledges [the obligatory status of these  deeds].\u2019  These  are  the  Murjiah  concerning  whom there is no doubt\u201d (Masail Harb al-Kirmani).\nFurthermore,  Allah  has  clarified  the  relationship  between salamah and istislam in many ayat in His book, including His command to fight the mushrikin. He \uf065 said, \u201cBut if they repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, then they are your brothers in religion; and We detail the verses for a people who know\u201d (At-Tawbah 11). After reciting this ayah, al-Fudayl Ibn \u2018Iyad \uf072 said, \u201cAllah \uf062 has made repentance from shirk be both through speech and action, via the establishing of prayer and the offering of zakah. The  people  of  Ray  [those  who  prefer  their  opinions  to many ahadith of the Prophet \uf067] said, \u2018Neither the prayer nor the zakah nor any of the obligatory deeds are from iman,\u2019 thereby fabricating a lie against Allah \uf062 and opposing His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet \uf067. If it were really as they claim, Abu Bakr \uf068 would not have fought the apostates!\u201d (As-Sunnah \u2013 \u2018Abdullah Ibn Ahmad).\nThe Sahabah \uf06a had consensus that there is no Islam without submission, so they made takfir of the one who abandons the prayer due to laziness, as he is one who has completely  abandoned  action.  They  also  made  takfir  of those who withheld the zakah, as they had resisted with force  an  obvious  and  clear-cut  law  of  the  Shari\u2019ah.  The extreme Murjiah opposed them in this (in that there is no Islam without submission), thus they were unaware of the reality of the Islam Allah is pleased with as a religion for the people. Likewise, the Sahabah \uf06a had consensus that there is no Islam without salamah, so they made takfir of the  category  of  apostates  who  went  back  to  worshiping idols  \u2013  and  they  were  idols  that  had  been  made  in  the image forms of the righteous \u2013 and they did not consider any of the following to be impediments for making takfir of the individuals: The peoples\u2019 recent withdrawal from Jahiliyyah, the emergence of liars claiming prophethood, or  the  usurping  of  the  Muslims\u2019  lands  by  the  apostates resisting  zakah  with  force.  The  modern-day  Jahmiyyah opposed them in this, going against the statement of the Messenger  \uf067,  \u201cWhoever  dies  knowing  \u2018la  ilaha  illallah\u2019 \n\f", "schema:headline": "Stand and Die upon That for Which Your Brothers Died", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "1"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah8-Establishing-the-Islamic-State:-Part-2", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "8Article\n\fJust as the blood of the kafir is halal to shed,1 so too is the kafir\u2019s wealth halal to take.

He then mentioned the order to kill all those who claim partners  for  Allah,  saying,  \u201cSo  when  the  sacred  months have passed, then kill the mushrikin wherever you find \n1\u2002See Rumiyah, issue 1, \u201cThe Kafir\u2019s Blood Is Halal for You, So Shed It.\u201d\nthem.

The battles and carnage burned in various areas of Iraq. Battalions and groups were formed and the  mujahidin  stood  up  in  defiance,  seizing  convoys of the enemy, hunting their patrols, and raiding their positions. And by Allah\u2019s grace, we witnessed many of their losses, which were inflicted all across Iraq. So of the causes of pride of this conquest was that the sons of jihad gained confidence as they saw the myths  of  modern warfare collapsing before  them.  Their resolve has now been liberated from  the illusion  of  inability and  fear,  and  they have  risen  to  the fields  of  earnestness and  action.\nFourth, the Battle of  Fallujah  achieved an important, strategic  military  victory, as everyone knows of the superiority of the American  military machine and the development of its armies and war discipline, which relies on striking targets from afar without clashing and combat,  thereby  securing  the  safety  of  the  American soldier without him being wasted in dangerous battles that could cost him his life. But Fallujah lured this great machine through a carefully managed plan. She lured it to harsh, unconventional street wars that would spend its effort, energy, and equipment. The American soldier would face death and destruction from whence he did not expect, as the Americans were forced to descend into alleys and streets, and to enter houses and buildings. The enemy was exposed to the fires of the mujahidin and their ambushes. Their abilities were taken by surprise through the strategy of attack-and-retreat. They  were  compelled  to  engage  in  close  combat  for which they were unprepared, suffering great losses of life and equipment, exceeding hundreds of people and dozens of vehicles.\nFifth, the American military administration tasted the greatest of defeats, as it became clear to the sponsors and planners of this war that the mujahidin will not be stopped by any kind of deterrent, even if that meant \nwaging a war of total annihilation. For the jihadi mentality has become the greatest dilemma ahead of American and global plans of war. And what happened in Fallujah, of feats of pride and steadfastness, weakened the resolve of the enemy\u2019s leadership and afflicted them with depression, anxiety, and confusion. And what is waiting for them is even more disastrous and bitter, by the help of Allah c.\nTHE AMERICANS LOST HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS IN THE BATTLE OF FALLUJAH\nSixth, Fallujah contributed its share of steadfastness and composure by unveiling the mask from the faces of riddah, nifaq, and treachery. It removed the cloak of deceit worn by the apostate Allawi government, just as it uncovered the lies they repeat about wanting what is  in  the  interest  of  the  Iraqi  people  by  sparing  their blood and shielding them from wars and woes, and that they strive to earn their pleasure. Yet all people can see as they move quickly to execute the decision to go to war in Fallujah, washing their hands in the pure blood of the sons of the city, killing thousands of them and displacing tens of thousands, while overseeing the destruction, devastation, degradation of honor, and theft of wealth under the pretext of being at war with terrorism and having concern for the national interest.\nSeventh, the battle knocked the false mask off the ugly  Rafidi  image.  For  they  penetrated  deeply  with their spite into this battle.

This will but increase the disputes within their ranks, as well as their endeavor to betray each other. And Allah does not guide a wrongdoing people.\nThus, whoever wants to hold tightly to the strong rope of Allah, he must repent to Allah and adhere to the religion of Islam and the Muslim Jama\u2019ah until he dies. Otherwise, he will be among the stones in Jahannam and piles of men therein.\nFurthermore, it was reported that Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever clings to something is left to it\u201d (Reported by an-Nasai from Abu Hurayrah).\nSulayman  Al  ash-Shaykh  \uf072  said,  \u201cWhoever\u2019s  heart clings to something, in that it relies on it and is hopeful of it, Allah leaves him to that thing. So if the slave clings to his Lord, his God, his Master, his Patron, the Lord and Owner of everything, then he is left to Him, so He will suffice him, protect him, safeguard him, and be his ally \u2013 and what a good ally and supporter He is! This is just as He \uf063 said, \u2018Is not Allah sufficient for His slave?\u2019 (Az-Zu-\nErdogan abandons his Sahwah slaves to the Nusayriyyah\nmar 36). And whoever clings to sorcery and devils, then Allah will leave him to them, and they will destroy him in the Dunya and in the Akhirah. In general, whoever relies on other than Allah, whatever it may be, is left to it and he will see evil in the Dunya and the Akhrirah coming at him from its direction, contrary to his expectance. This is the irreplaceable sunnah and unchangeable work of Allah regarding His slaves, that whoever seeks comfort in other than Him, puts his trust in other than Him, or depends on something created to manage his affairs, then Allah will cause that thing to do the opposite of what he hoped from it. This is known through revelation and experience, and whoever reflects deeply over this and the conditions of the creation will see it clearly\u201d (Taysir al-\u2018Aziz al-Hamid).\nHe also said, \u201cThe act of \u2018clinging\u2019 can be of the heart, through action, or both. That is, one who clings to something with his heart, or clings to something with his heart and action, then he is left to it, meaning Allah leaves him to that thing to which he clung. So whoever attaches himself to Allah, seeks Allah\u2019s aid for his need, takes refuge with Him, and entrusts all of his affairs to Him, then He suffices for him every need, brings close to him what is distant, and makes easy for him what is difficult. And whoever clings to other than Him or relies on his knowledge, his intellect, medicine, or amulets, and depends on his might and power, then Allah leaves him to that and abandons him. This is known through the texts and through experience. Allah \uf063 said, \u2018Whoever relies upon Allah, then He is sufficient for him\u2019 (At-Talaq 3)\u2026 Wahb Ibn Munabbih said, \u2018Allah \uf066 inspired to Dawud, \u2018O Dawud, by My might and My greatness, none of My slaves adheres to Me \n\f", "schema:headline": "Front Cover", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "0"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah8-Being-Blessed-with-Health-and-Tested-with-Illness", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "Allah  c  ordered  His  slaves  to  guard  themselves from  everything  that  harms  and  afflicts  them,  and urged them towards the good things and forbade them from impurities and abomination, that which harms the  psyche  or  physical  health.  He  sent  His  Prophet with  a  complete,  divine  manhaj  that  encompasses both  religious  and  worldly  matters.  The  Sunnah  is filled with varieties of divine graces which protect the Muslim in body and mind. Allah c says, \u201cThose who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet, whom they find written in what they have of the Torah and the Injil (Gospel). He enjoins upon them what is good and forbids them what is evil and he makes lawful for them the pure things and prohibits for them the impure\u201d (al-A\u2019raf 157). At-Tabari r says, \u201cConcerning His saying, \u2018he makes lawful for them the pure things,\u2019 \nthis refers to what Jahiliyyah used to forbid, including \u2018bahirah,\u2019 \u2018saibah,\u2019 \u2018wasilah,\u2019 and \u2018ham\u2019 (four categories of livestock invented by the mushrikin based on certain traits). \u2018And He prohibits for them the impure,\u2019 and  this  includes  the  meat  of  swine,  riba,  and  that which  they  used  to  make  halal  from  the  foods  and drinks which Allah made haram.\u201d\nHealth Is a Blessing That Many People \nAre Heedless Of\nFrom the greatest of the blessings of Allah c on His creation is the blessing of good health, which none is aware of except those who lose it, and if one loses it he spends everything he owns to cure himself and restore his  health,  according  to  his  ability.  The  Sunnah  has \n30Article\n\fthe testimony that \u201cMuhammad is the Messenger of Allah\u201d comprises the truth that he is a worshiper, not something to be worshiped, and a truthful messenger who does not lie. Instead, he is to be obeyed and followed because he is conveying the message from Allah c. So he m has that status of messenger and of conveyance from Allah, as well as that of judging between people when they have disagreements \u2013 for he does not judge except by the rule of Allah, with his concern for life, family, wealth, and land. And he has no share of  divinity.  Rather,  he  is  the  slave  of  Allah  and  His Messenger, just as Allah c said, \u201cThat when the slave of Allah stood, supplicating Him, they were almost as multitudes against him\u201d (Al-Jinn 19). And he g said, \u201cI am only His slave, so say, \u2018the slave of Allah and His Messenger\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari).\nAmong the consequences of that include properly adhering to him, seeking his judgment in matters of dispute, and rejecting the judgment of all others. (For the hypocrites are those who claim to believe in him while they seek the judgment of others). In this way, the slave shall realize the perfection of tawhid and adherence, ultimately realizing his own complete satisfaction. This is the meaning of the two testimonies. Once this is clear, then the meaning of the ayah is that Allah f) has disapproved of whoever claims to believe in what Allah revealed to His Messenger and to the prophets before him while at the same time wanting to seek judgment for resolving disputes from other than the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. Ibnul-Qayyim  said,  \u201cTaghut  is  whoever  transgresses his limit, as it comes from tughyan, which means surpassing the boundary.\u201d So anyone from whom two opponents seek judgment, while he judges by other than the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger g, then he is a taghut, as he has transgressed his limit. Thereby, everyone who worships something besides Allah is actually worshiping taghut, surpassing the boundary with what he worships and giving worship to what does not deserve it. Such is the case of whoever makes other than Allah and His Messenger g the judge and seeks judgment therefrom in matters  of  dispute.  Included  in  His  saying,  \u201cthose  who claim that they believe,\u201d is the rejection of what they have alleged of having iman. As such, He did not say, \u201cthose who believe,\u201d because if they were truly people of iman, they would not have wanted to seek judgment  from  other  than  Allah  c  and  His  Messenger g, and He would not have said of them, \u201cthose who claim.\u201d This is something mostly only said of one who \nThe taghut International Criminal Court\nfalsely alleges something, as his action negates and opposes what that claim entails. Ibn Kathir said, \u201cThis ayah dispraises whoever deviates from the Book and the Sunnah and seeks judgment from anything else, which is invalid \u2013 and that is what is meant here by \u2018taghut.\u2019\u201d\nHis c saying, \u201cThough they were ordered to disbelieve  therein,\u201d  i.e.  in  taghut,  proves  that  seeking judgment from taghut is contradictory to iman, even opposite to it. So iman is not sound except after disbelieving in taghut and abandoning seeking judgment therefrom. Whoever does not disbelieve in taghut has not believed in Allah.\nHis c saying, \u201cAnd Shaytan wants to lead them far astray,\u201d  means  that  wanting  to  seek  judgment  from other than the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger g is obedience to Shaytan. And he only calls his party to become residents of the Inferno. In this ayah, there is evidence that abandoning seeking judgment from taghut, which is anything other than the Book and the Sunnah, is an obligation, and that the one who seeks judgment therefrom is not a believ-\n\f", "schema:headline": "Being Blessed with Health and Tested with Illness", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Rumiyah_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "29"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah7-Contents", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Rumiyah", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "Issue 7\nCONTENTS\nO  muwahhidin,  rejoice,  for  by  Allah, we will not rest from our jihad except beneath  the  olive  trees  of  Rumiyah (Rome).Abu Hamzah al-Muhajir \uf08a\nF o r e w o r d\nE x c l u s i v e\nA r t i c l e s\nN e w s\nCONTENTS\n\flamic State \u2013 and the allies of Shaytan from the murtaddin of the Turkish and Nusayri armies, the Sahwat, the  Rafidi  militias,  and  the  Russian  and  American Crusaders, and their allies from the evil scholars, the claimants of jihad, and the political parties and organizations, has indeed revealed the truth for all to see the nature of these murtaddin who refuse the rule of Shari\u2019ah.

And their practical hostility to the people of tawhid and the Shari\u2019ah of Islam greatly exceeds their claimed hostility to those Jews, Crusaders, Rafidah, and Nusayriyyah who kill the muwahhidin and violate their women.\nThe city of Bab and its surrounding areas, which the  murtaddin  of  \u201cThe  Euphrates  Shield\u201d  were  unable to breach for more than 100 days, suffered destruction the likes of which no other city in Sham has faced at the hands of the Rafidah and Nusayriyyah, as its Muslim people were killed by the hundreds due to the continuous shelling mutually supported by the mushrikin  and  murtaddin.\nVarious groups of the enemies of Islam joined in assisting in this destruction.

They were unconcerned  about  the  partnership  made  with  the Nusayriyyah, the Rafidah, and the Russian Crusaders, in the campaign against Bab, as they found that the only opposition thereto was from the soldiers of the  Islamic  State.  They  even  incited  their  murtadd brethren to participate in \u201cThe Euphrates Shield\u201d in order to appease their taghut masters, and the masters of their masters, the Crusaders.\nThe slaughter of the kuffar in Bab, in which the lions of the Khilafah\u2019s army stood steadfast, as stable as mountains, was a great nuisance to the murtaddin, and not only in loss of life and equipment or as an insult to the reputation of their armies; rather, it truly exposed those who participated and who have claimed to be Muslims, claimed to care about Muslim blood, and claimed to support the Muslims.\nAs such, the steadfastness of the mujahidin, wherever they are, in the face of their enemies \u2013 by Allah\u2019s permission \u2013 will expose their secrets and show their flaws.

Indeed, their affliction upon Islam is severe, due to their claims of affiliation, allegiance, and bringing victory to it, while in reality they are its enemies. Those who are ignorant think that what they are upon is sound knowledge and correctness, but it is the greatest extent of ignorance and corruption.\nBy Allah, how many strongholds of Islam have they destroyed?!  And  how  many  of  its  bastions  have  they uprooted  the  foundations  thereof  and  ruined?!  And how many of its symbols have they erased?! And how many of its raised flags have they left and abandoned?! And how often have they struck at its roots with the pickaxes of doubt in order to uproot it?!

They do not accept the guidance of Allah which He sent with His Messenger, nor do they give it  any  importance,  nor  do  they  see  any  problem  in abandoning it for the sake of their own opinions and ideas. They have stripped the revealed text from its real status and they separated it from its significance and certain definitiveness, and thus they launched against it a barrage of false doubts, with which they continue to carry out ambush after ambush.

Rather, they dedicated their effort into doing that which was ordered and leaving that which was prohibited. Thus, the way of the late comers is more sound in knowledge and more precise, while the way of the predecessors was more ignorant, yet safer.\u201d\nThus, they made the status of the revealed text of the Quran and the Sunnah like that of the Khalifah in these times \u2013 his name minted on coins and exalted on the pulpits during the khutbah, while the judgment of others is that which is enforced and his judgment is neither heard nor accepted.\n They cloak themselves in the gown of iman, while their  hearts  are  deviated  and  lost,  filled  with  malice and disbelief.
