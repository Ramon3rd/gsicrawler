GSI Crawler is an innovative and useful framework which aims to extract information from web pages enriching following semantic approaches.
At the moment, there are three available platforms: Twitter, Reddit and News.
The user interacts with the tool through a web interface, selecting the analysis type he wants to carry out and the platform that is going to be examined.
