What is GSI Crawler?
----------------

GSI Crawler is an innovative and useful framework which aims to extract information from web pages enriching following semantic approaches. At the moment, there are three available platforms: Twitter, Reddit and News. The user interacts with the tool through a web interface, selecting the analysis type he wants to carry out and the platform that is going to be examined.

In this documentation we are going to introduce this framework, detailing the global architecture of the project and explaining each module functionality. Finally we will expose most a case study in order to better understand the system itself.
