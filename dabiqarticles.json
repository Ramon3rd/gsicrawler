Why is it that the chest muscles of America and its allies shiver out of fear of you? Where are your warplanes? Where are your battleships? Where are your missiles? Where are your weapons of mass destruction? Why is it that the world has united against you? Why  have  the  nations  of  disbelief  entrenched together against you?\u201d\n\u201cSo know that \u2013 by Allah \u2013 we fear not the swarms of planes, nor ballistic missiles, nor drones, nor satellites, nor battleships, nor weapons of mass destruction.  How  could  we  fear  them,  while Allah the Exalted has said, {If Allah should aid you, no one can overcome you; but if He should forsake you, who is there that can aid you after Him? And upon Allah let the believers rely} [\u0100li \u2018Imr\u0101n: 160]. How could we fear them, while Allah the Exalted has said, {So do not weaken and do not grieve, and you will be superior if you are [true] believers} [\u0100li \u2018Imr\u0101n: 139].\u201d\nother, for some people have entered your ranks who are not of you and are only claimants. And thus some disorder has occurred. So it has become  necessary  for  a  trial  to  come,  expel  the filth, and purify the ranks. We ask Allah for forgiveness and wellness.  Also, pride and  conceit has entered some of our souls, and thus some of us transgressed and oppressed others. So it is necessary for the sins to be expelled, so that you may return to your Lord. Allah has loved the muj\u0101hid\u012bn, and so there is no choice but for Him to take some martyrs. We ask Allah to make us of them, not from the disgraced nor those afflicted [in their religion].\u201d\n\u201cO America, O allies of America, and O crusaders,  know  that  the  matter  is  more  dangerous than  you  have  imagined  and  greater  than  you have envisioned. We have warned you that today we are in a new era, an era where the State, its soldiers, and its sons are leaders not slaves. They are a people who through the ages have not known defeat. The outcome of their battles is concluded before they begin. They have not prepared for a battle since the time of Noah except with absolute conviction of victory. Being killed \u2013 according to their account \u2013 is a victory. This is where the secret lies. You fight a people who can never be defeated.\u201d\n\u201cTherefore Allah will give you victory. Indeed, Allah will give you victory. By Allah, Allah will give you victory.  So  guarantee  for  us  two  matters,  and we will guarantee you \u2013 by Allah\u2019s permission \u2013  constant  victory  and  consolidation.  First,  do not  oppress  anyone  nor  be  content  with  oppression by being silent about it and not raising the matter to those in authority. Second, do not become conceited or arrogant. This is what we fear from you and fear for you.\u201d\n\u201cThereafter know that a trial, sifting, and selection, are necessary between one period and an-\n\u201cAnd so we promise you by Allah\u2019s permission that this campaign will be your final campaign. It  will  be  broken  and  defeated,  just  as  all your  previous  campaigns  were  broken  and defeated, except that this time we will raid you  thereafter,  and  you  will  never  raid  us. \ndabiq\fummah,  for  He  legalized  war  booty  for  them.It has also been claimed that the Ummah was favored  with  the  legality  of  ghan\u012bmah  taken through fighting, not fay\u2019; and that what is taken without fighting [fay\u2019] was hal\u0101l and mub\u0101h for those nations before us. He made the provision of His Messenger from the latter [the fay\u2019].\nWar booty is more lawful than other income for a number of reasons.\nIt is seized from one who does not deserve it, because he uses it to aid himself in disobeying Allah  and  associating  others  with  Him.  So  if  it is  taken  from  one  who  uses  it  contrary  to  the obedience of Allah, the practice of tawh\u012bd and the  da\u2019wah  to  worship  Him,  then  such  wealth becomes  the  most  beloved  of  wealth  to  Allah ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101 and the purest form of income in His sight.Also, he (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) would not perform jih\u0101d except so that Allah\u2019s word would be the highest and His religion the most manifest. He did not perform jih\u0101d for the sake of ghan\u012bmah. So provision would come to him pursuant to his worship and jih\u0101d f\u012b sab\u012blill\u0101h. Therefore, he did not dedicate any of his time solely towards seeking provision.  Rather he would worship Allah in all his time, and practice tawh\u012bd of Allah and be sincere to Him. So Allah made his provision easy during such worship, without him intending to seek it or endeavoring to pursue it.It was reported in the mursal narration (i.e. reported  with  no  mention  of  the  Sah\u0101b\u012b  in  the \nisn\u0101d), that he (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) said, \u201cI am the messenger of mercy. I am the messenger of the malhamah (bloody battle). Allah sent me with jih\u0101d and He did not send me with agriculture\u201d [reported by Ibn Sa\u2019d in \u201cat-Tabaq\u0101t\u201d].\nAl-Baghaw\u012b  reported  in  his  \u201cMu\u2019jam\u201d  a  marf\u016b\u2019 had\u012bth (i.e. a had\u012bth whose words are conveyed as  the  Prophet\u2019s)  [that  the  Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) said], \u201cIndeed Allah has sent me with guidance and the religion of truth. He did not make me a farmer, nor a merchant, nor a shouter in the markets. And He placed my provision in my spear.\u201d\nHe mentioned the spear rather than the sword so that it is not understood that he got provision from the ghan\u012bmah wealth. Rather, his provision was  from  the  fay\u2019  that  Allah  granted  him  from Khaybar and Fadak.\nFay\u2019 is what the enemy leaves behind after fearfully fleeing, contrary to ghan\u012bmah, which is taken  through  fighting  with  the  sword.  Therefore, mention of the spear more clearly indicates the acquirement  of  fay\u2019,  because  the  spear  is  seen by the enemy from a distance, so he flees, and thus  he  flees  from  the  spear\u2019s  shade  by  which fay\u2019 is taken. The provision of the Prophet (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) was from fay\u2019, not ghan\u012bmah, which is taken by fighting with a sword. And Allah knows best.\ndabiq\f", "schema:headline": "INDEED YOUR LORD IS EVER WATCHFUL ", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "6"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq6-ADVICE-FOR-THE-SOLDIERS-OF-THE-ISLAMIC-STATE-", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "6", "schema:articleBody": "path of Allah? So Allah\u2019s Messenger (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) said, \u2018Whoever fights so that the word of Allah is the highest is fighting in the path of Allah.\u2019\u201d\n[2] Ask the people of knowledge what is required of you when anything befalls you concerning the obligation of jih\u0101d in the path of Allah, for there is  a  scholarly  consensus  that  knowledge  must precede  action.  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa salllam) said, \u201cSeeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.\u201d  So don\u2019t kill or  take  ghan\u012bmah  without  first  knowing  why you\u2019re doing so. And the least that can be done in that regard is to seek the fatw\u0101 of a scholar whose  knowledge  and  religious  practice  you trust.\n[3]  Beware  of  letting  the  affection  you  have towards a relative or loved one turn you away from  aiding  Allah\u2019s  religion.  Indeed,  we  know that this can tear you apart, but remember the statement of Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101), {O you who have believed, do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies, extending to them affection while they  have  disbelieved  in  what  came  to  you  of the truth} [Al-Mumtahanah: 1]. For Allah\u2019s right is more obligatory, and supporting His religion is more essential.\n[4] By Allah, I love you, and I love that which will save you. So listen to my advice concerning an important issue, the issue of takf\u012br. The Messenger (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) said, \u201cWhoever says concerning a believer that which is not true, Allah will cause him to reside in the mud of  corruption  [composed  of  the  pus  from  the people of Hellfire] until he takes back what he said.\u201d  Therefore, know my dear brother that the label and ruling of kufr is a right that belongs to Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) and which you are not allowed to apply to anyone except those who deserve it according to the Shar\u012b\u2019ah. And know that takf\u012br has both conditions and preventative factors, so we don\u2019t declare takf\u012br of someone unless the conditions are fulfilled and the preventative factors are  eliminated.  A  person  might  make  a  state-\nADVICE FOR THE SOLDIERS OF THE ISLAMIC STATE\nment  or  action  of  kufr  and  yet  would  not  be guilty of kufr due to the presence of one of the preventative factors. Therefore, one whose Islam is established with certainty is not expelled from  Islam  except  with  certainty.  So  beware of  suspicion,  and  ensure  that  you\u2019re  well-informed regarding the issues that the practicing scholars have differed over.\n[5] Fulfill any agreements and covenants of security that are valid according to the Shar\u012b\u2019ah, and be extremely cautious of Shayt\u0101n\u2019s incitements. Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) said, {So he who breaks his word  only  breaks  it  to  the  detriment  of  himself} [Al-Fath: 10]. Allah\u2019s Messenger (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  said,  \u201cThe  blood  of  every Muslim is equal. The lowest amongst them will have  his  guarantee  of  protection  fulfilled  by them. The most distant of them will also have his guarantee of protection honored. They are one hand against all others. The weak fighter amongst them is equal in his share of ghan\u012bmah with the strong fighter amongst them, and the dispatched fighter who guards the rear of the army is equal in his share of ghan\u012bmah with the fighter who is sent out on an expedition to attack.\u201d\nLikewise, know that we do not allow any soldier to make pacts or grant security. This is only to be done by Am\u012brul-Mu\u2019min\u012bn and his deputies, for he is typically more aware of, and better capable of determining the interests of the State.\n[6] Strive hard to obey Allah and beware the ominous consequences of sin as well as the evil of your inner self and the Shayt\u0101n. For indeed alF\u0101r\u016bq, \u2018Umar Ibn al-Khatt\u0101b, advised Sa\u2019d Ibn Ab\u012b Waqq\u0101s (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anhum\u0101) saying, \u201cSo I order both you and the soldiers who are with you to have taqw\u0101 of Allah, and I order both you and the soldiers who are with you to be more vigilant against committing sins than you are against your enemy, for the sins of your soldiers should be more feared than their enemy. And ask Allah to help you against your inner selves just as you ask Him for victory over your enemy.\u201d\ndabiq\n\fTHE QA\u2019IDAH OF ADH-DHAWAHIRI, AL-HARARI, AND AN-NADHARI, AND THE ABSENT YEMENI WISDOM\nFEATURE  \nthing beyond that knowledge such as pitting the statements of the people against each other and excessively searching for their faults and slip-ups [\u2026] as well as excessively searching for the unnecessary aspects of sciences that do not benefit one\u2019s religious adherence, that serve to distract one from Allah and from being preoccupied with Him, that harden one\u2019s heart towards His dhikr, and that cause the experts of such sciences to desire a high position and leadership of the people.  None  of  this  is  praiseworthy,  and  indeed the  Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  used to  seek  refuge  from  knowledge  that  does  not benefit [Reported by Muslim on the authority of Zayd]. In a had\u012bth reported from him he said, \u2018Ask Allah for beneficial knowledge and seek refuge with Allah from knowledge that does not benefit\u2019 [Reported by Ibn M\u0101jah on the authority of J\u0101bir]. In another had\u012bth reported from him he said, \u2018Indeed, from knowledge is to be ignorant of some things\u2019 [Reported by Ab\u016b D\u0101w\u016bd on the authority of Buraydah]. The Prophet (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) disliked excessive and extensive speech, and loved concise speech. There are many ah\u0101d\u012bth reported from him to that effect and they would take long to mention\u201d [Majm\u016b\u2019 Ras\u0101\u2019il Ibn Rajab].\nHe  (rahimahull\u0101h)  also  said,  \u201cIbn  Mas\u2019\u016bd  also said, \u2018You live in a time in which there are many scholars and few speakers, and there will come a time after you in which there will be few scholars and many speakers.\u2019 Therefore, he who has extensive knowledge and speaks little is praiseworthy, and he who is the opposite is blameworthy.  The  Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam) attested  to  the  people  of  Yemen  having  \u012bm\u0101n and fiqh. The people of Yemen are the least in speech from amongst the people and the least excessive in knowledge because their knowledge is beneficial knowledge in their hearts, and they only express with their tongues what they need to of that knowledge. And that is true fiqh and beneficial knowledge\u201d [Fadl \u2018Ilm as-Salaf].\nAfter  reading  \u201cFadl  \u2018Ilm  as-Salaf  \u2018Al\u0101  \u2018Ilm  alKhalaf\u201d  by  al-H\u0101fidh  Ibn  Rajab  (rahimahull\u0101h), \nhis  statement  \u201cThe  people  of  Yemen  are  the least in speech from amongst the people\u201d stuck to my mind for years. I then witnessed it in reality firsthand in the bay\u2019\u0101t announced by the muj\u0101hid\u012bn of the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen, Sinai, Libya, and Algeria, for the shortest of the five statements was the statement of the muj\u0101hid\u012bn of Yemen. It contained wisdom, fiqh and \u012bm\u0101n, and through it, they expressed their full conviction in a brief and concise manner. I ask Allah to make them firm upon their covenant so that they meet Allah while He is pleased with them.\nThe muj\u0101hid\u012bn of Yemen said, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  had  given  us glad tidings of Khil\u0101fah upon the methodology of prophethood. And indeed, by Allah, we have seen it as a Khil\u0101fah upon the methodology of prophethood.  And  when  we  heard  the  trumpets  of  the  Jews  and  Christians  \u2013  the  callers upon the gates of Hellfire \u2013 we answered the order of Allah\u2019s Messenger that obliged sticking to the jam\u0101\u2019ah of the Muslims and their Im\u0101m, for Hudhayfah (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anh) said, \u2018The people used to ask Allah\u2019s Messenger (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) about good, and I used to ask him about evil, fearing that it might overtake me\u2026\u2019 In  the  had\u012bth,  he  says,  \u2018Is  there  any  evil  after this good?\u2019 He responded, \u2018Yes, callers upon the gates of Hellfire. Whoever answers them will be thrown into it by them.\u2019 He said, \u2018O Allah\u2019s Messenger, describe them to me.\u2019 He said, \u2018They are from our skin and speak with our tongues.\u2019 He said, \u2018So what do you order me with if I reach that time?\u2019 He said, \u2018Stick to the jam\u0101\u2019ah of the Muslims and their Im\u0101m\u2019 [Al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim].\u201d\nThus,  they  recognized  the  disease  \u2013  splitting and differing \u2013 and they knew the cure \u2013 unity and rallying together. They understood that rallying together meant sticking to the jam\u0101\u2019ah of the Muslims (the Khil\u0101fah) and their Im\u0101m (the Khal\u012bfah), not rallying together upon factionalism and partisanship. So they spoke with the prophetic wisdom, and said \u201cwe hear and obey\u201d without any reluctance, complication, or arrogance.\ndabiq\n1\f", "schema:headline": "ADVICE FOR THE SOLDIERS OF THE ISLAMIC STATE ", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "6"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq14-In-the-Words-of-the-Enemy", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "14", "schema:articleBody": "Attacks continue\nof its operations to other regions. The terrorist attacks carried out in the final months of 2015 demonstrate that it is capable of committing attacks on\u2026targets outside the territories under its control. The extent of its reach was notably demonstrated by the suicide bombings in Beirut on 12 November 2015, the coordinated attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015 and the attacks in Jakarta by an ISIL affiliate on 14 January 2016, which closely resembled the Paris attacks\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe recent expansion of the ISIL sphere of influence across West and North Africa, the Middle East and South and South-East Asia demonstrates  the  speed  and  scale  at  which the gravity of the threat has evolved in just 18 months. The complexity of the recent attacks and  the  level  of  planning,  coordination  and sophistication  involved  raise  concerns  about its  future  evolution.  Moreover,  other  terrorist  groups\u2026are  sufficiently  attracted  by  its underlying  ideology  to  pledge  allegiance  to its so-called caliphate and self-proclaimed caliph. ISIL has also benefited from the arrival of a steady stream of foreign terrorist fighters, who continue to leave their communities to replenish its ranks. The return of these fighters from the battlefields of Iraq and the Syrian Arab  Republic  and  other  conflict  zones  is  a further  major  concern,  as  returnees  can  extend the presence of ISIL to their States of origin and use their skills and combat experience \nto recruit additional sympathizers, establish terrorist networks and commit terrorist acts\u2026\u201d\nThe report then goes on to detail how the Khil\u0101fah implements the Shar\u012b\u2019ah of zak\u0101h, da\u2019wah, jih\u0101d, jizyah, hisbah, slavery, and hud\u016bd \u2013 referring to all these laws with terms of mockery \u2013 and how this Shar\u012b\u2019ah poses a threat to \u201cinternational peace and security,\u201d AKA the \u201cnew world order.\u201d Instead of yielding by realizing that the Khil\u0101fah is here to stay and will continue ruling by the Shar\u012b\u2019ah and terrorizing its enemies, he recommended the following to the taw\u0101gh\u012bt of the divided \u201cUnited Nations\u201d:\n\u201cThe resolution of ongoing conflicts, including the Syrian conflict, would have a direct impact on the driving forces behind the recruitment of foreign terrorist fighters by ISIL \u2026 In order to address the grave threat posed by ISIL, including the influx of foreign terrorist fighters to Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic and ISIL\u2019s extensive financing activities, it is essential to identify a political resolution to the Syrian conflict. This process will require sustained and determined international commitment and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), which sets out a path towards formal intra-Syrian negotiations on a political transition process pursuant to the 2012 Geneva communiqu\u00e9 and a parallel nationwide ceasefire.\u201d\nAnd  thus,  after  the  Riyadh  Conference  of  the  Saudi  t\u0101gh\u016bt concluded, the Nusayriyyah and their atheist allies in the Democratic Forces of Syria \u2013 with Russian support and American consent  \u2013  blitzkrieged  across  regions  held  by  the  murtadd  sahw\u0101t, taking many major cities and towns through mere \u201cnegotiations\u201d with sahwah leaders who were part of the conspiracy to achieve \u201ca political resolution to the Syrian conflict.\u201d\nIs it not time the naive soldiers of the sahwah realize the evil of the plot in which they have served, repent from their apostasy, and join the ranks of the Khil\u0101fah?\n\funder one im\u0101m and to listen to and obey him. Secondly, we have seen that the Khil\u0101fah declared by the leadership of the Islamic State has  fulfilled  all  the  conditions enumerated by the scholars from among the righteous Salaf of the Ummah.  The  Prophet  g  said, \u201cWhoever  dies  without  having  a pledge of allegiance, dies a death of j\u0101hiliyyah\u201d [Reported by Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar]. Thirdly, we saw  the  crusaders,  the  R\u0101fidah, the PKK atheists, and all the other k\u0101fir parties uniting against the Khil\u0101fah and striking it altogether from a single bow. And thus, we realized  that  it  is  an  obligation upon us and the rest of the believers to join the camp of \u012bm\u0101n and fight  against  the  kuff\u0101r,  striking them altogether from a single bow as well. Allah c said, {And those who  disbelieved  are  allies  of  one another. If you do not do so, there will be fitnah on earth and great corruption}  [Al-Anf\u0101l:  73].\nD\u0100BIQ:  How  was  the  reaction among the Muslims of Bengal towards  the  operations  conducted by  the  Khil\u0101fah  soldiery  there?\nSH.  AB\u016a  IBR\u0100H\u012aM:  The  muwahidd\u012bn  in  Bengal  were  greatly  supportive  of  our  operations against  the  kuff\u0101r,  walhamdulill\u0101h. They saw us fighting against all  the  kuff\u0101r  in  our  targeting  of the  crusaders,  the  R\u0101fidah,  the Q\u0101diy\u0101niyyah,  the  Hindus,  the missionaries, and others, all within  a  short  period  of  time.  They saw that with the help of Allah, a small number of muj\u0101hid\u012bn with limited  means  are  able  to  target and  intimidate  the  various  sects of kufr in any part of the region despite all the false claims of supremacy attributed to the t\u0101gh\u016bt \nforces and designed  to  intimidate the believers. This brought  hope to  the  Muslims in Bengal after a lengthy pause in jih\u0101d in  the  region. Thus,  by  the grace of Allah, the  revival  of the in Bengal  through  our  operations brought  happiness  to  the  Muslims  in  Bengal  and  everywhere else while also enraging the kuff\u0101r. And  all  praise  is  due  to  Allah alone.\nA Q\u0101diy\u0101n\u012b temple\njih\u0101d \nD\u0100BIQ:  Has  the  emergence  of the  Khil\u0101fah\u2019s  soldiers  in  Bengal had any effect in intimidating or silencing the apostates who insult the Prophet g and those who call to  secularism?\nSH. AB\u016a IBR\u0100H\u012aM: Alhamdulill\u0101h,  the  emergence  of  the  soldiers of the Khil\u0101fah has terrified the kuff\u0101r in the region in general and in particular the atheists and secularists  who  mock  Islam  and our  beloved  Prophet  g.  This became  evident  when  some  of the leading atheists in the region claimed  to  have  received  death threats  from  the  soldiers  of  the Khil\u0101fah in Bengal. But it is not the methodology of the Khil\u0101fah\u2019s soldiers  to  send  mere  threats  to the enemies of Allah. Rather, we let our actions do the talking. And our  soldiers  are  presently  sharpening  their  knives  to  slaughter the  atheists,  the  mockers  of  the Prophet g, and every other apostate in the region, bi idnill\u0101h. We say  just  as  Shaykh  Us\u0101mah  Ibn \nL\u0101din \uf072 said, \u201cIf there is no limit to the freedom of your words, then let your hearts be open to the freedom  of  our  actions.\u201d\nD\u0100BIQ: Tell us about the general state of Islam and religiousness in Bengal.\nSH. AB\u016a IBR\u0100H\u012aM: In general, the people of Bengal love Islam and  try  to  practice  its  rites  with great enthusiasm. However, there is much ignorance of the Qur\u2019\u0101n and  the  Sunnah  here,  leading  to the growing influence of heretical sects and murtadd parties.

He made the provision of His Messenger from the latter [the fay\u2019].\nWar booty is more lawful than other income for a number of reasons.\nIt is seized from one who does not deserve it, because he uses it to aid himself in disobeying Allah  and  associating  others  with  Him.  So  if  it is  taken  from  one  who  uses  it  contrary  to  the obedience of Allah, the practice of tawh\u012bd and the  da\u2019wah  to  worship  Him,  then  such  wealth becomes  the  most  beloved  of  wealth  to  Allah ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101 and the purest form of income in His sight.Also, he (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) would not perform jih\u0101d except so that Allah\u2019s word would be the highest and His religion the most manifest. He did not perform jih\u0101d for the sake of ghan\u012bmah. So provision would come to him pursuant to his worship and jih\u0101d f\u012b sab\u012blill\u0101h. Therefore, he did not dedicate any of his time solely towards seeking provision.  Rather he would worship Allah in all his time, and practice tawh\u012bd of Allah and be sincere to Him. So Allah made his provision easy during such worship, without him intending to seek it or endeavoring to pursue it.It was reported in the mursal narration (i.e. reported  with  no  mention  of  the  Sah\u0101b\u012b  in  the \nisn\u0101d), that he (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) said, \u201cI am the messenger of mercy. I am the messenger of the malhamah (bloody battle). Allah sent me with jih\u0101d and He did not send me with agriculture\u201d [reported by Ibn Sa\u2019d in \u201cat-Tabaq\u0101t\u201d].\nAl-Baghaw\u012b  reported  in  his  \u201cMu\u2019jam\u201d  a  marf\u016b\u2019 had\u012bth (i.e. a had\u012bth whose words are conveyed as  the  Prophet\u2019s)  [that  the  Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) said], \u201cIndeed Allah has sent me with guidance and the religion of truth. He did not make me a farmer, nor a merchant, nor a shouter in the markets. And He placed my provision in my spear.\u201d\nHe mentioned the spear rather than the sword so that it is not understood that he got provision from the ghan\u012bmah wealth. Rather, his provision was  from  the  fay\u2019  that  Allah  granted  him  from Khaybar and Fadak.\nFay\u2019 is what the enemy leaves behind after fearfully fleeing, contrary to ghan\u012bmah, which is taken  through  fighting  with  the  sword.  Therefore, mention of the spear more clearly indicates the acquirement  of  fay\u2019,  because  the  spear  is  seen by the enemy from a distance, so he flees, and thus  he  flees  from  the  spear\u2019s  shade  by  which fay\u2019 is taken. The provision of the Prophet (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) was from fay\u2019, not ghan\u012bmah, which is taken by fighting with a sword. And Allah knows best.\ndabiq\filies. Because of the Arabic terminologies used by this group either to describe themselves or their beliefs, some contemporary Muslim scholars  have  classified  them  as  possibly  an  apostate sect, not an originally mushrik religion, but upon  further  research,  it  was  determined  that this  group  is  one  that  existed  since  the  pre-Islamic j\u0101hiliyyah, but became \u201cIslamized\u201d by the surrounding Muslim population, language, and culture, although they never accepted Islam nor claimed to have adopted it. The apparent origin of the religion is found in the Magianism of ancient Persia, but reinterpreted with elements of Sabianism,  Judaism,  and  Christianity,  and  ultimately expressed in the heretical vocabulary of extreme Sufism.\nAccordingly,  the  Islamic  State  dealt  with  this group  as  the  majority  of  fuqah\u0101\u2019  have  indicated how mushrik\u012bn should be dealt with. Unlike the Jews and Christians, there was no room for jizyah payment. Also, their women could be enslaved unlike female apostates who the majority of the fuqah\u0101\u2019 say cannot be enslaved1  and can only be given an ultimatum to repent or face the sword. After capture, the Yazidi women and children were then divided according to the Shar\u012b\u2019ah amongst  the  fighters  of  the  Islamic  State  who participated in the Sinjar operations, after one fifth of the slaves were transferred to the Islamic State\u2019s authority to be divided as khums.\nThis large-scale enslavement of mushrik families is probably the first since the abandonment of this Shar\u012b\u2019ah law. The only other known case \u2013 albeit much smaller \u2013 is that of the enslavement of  Christian  women  and  children  in  the  Philippines and Nigeria by the muj\u0101hid\u012bn there.\nThe enslaved Yazidi families are now sold by the Islamic State soldiers as the mushrik\u012bn were sold by the Companions (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anhum) before _____________1     The enslavement of the apostate women belonging to apostate groups such as the r\u0101fidah, nusayriyyah, dur\u016bz, and ism\u0101\u2019\u012bliyyah is one that the fuqah\u0101\u2019 differ over. The majority of the scholars say that their women are not to be enslaved and only ordered to repent because of the had\u012bth, \u201cKill whoever changes his religion\u201d [Sah\u012bh al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b]. But some of the scholars including Shaykhul-Isl\u0101m Ibn Taymiyyah and the Ahn\u0101f (Hanafis) say they may be enslaved  due  to  the  actions  of  the  Companions  during  the  Wars  of  Apostasy where they enslaved the apostate women. This opinion is one also supported by evidence, wall\u0101hu a\u2019lam.\nthem.  Many  well-known  rulings  are  observed, including the prohibition of separating a mother from her young children. Many of the mushrik women and children have willingly accepted Islam and now race to practice it with evident sincerity after their exit from the darkness of shirk.\nRas\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  said, \u201cAllah marvels at a people who enter Jannah in chains\u201d [reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b on the authority of Ab\u016b Hurayrah]. The had\u012bth commentators mentioned that this refers to people entering Islam as slaves and then entering Jannah.\nAb\u016b Hurayrah (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anh) said while commenting on Allah\u2019s words, {You are the best nation  produced  for  mankind}  [\u0100li  \u2018Imr\u0101n:  110], \u201cYou are the best people for people. You bring them with chains around their necks, until they enter Islam\u201d [Sah\u012bh al-Bukh\u0101ri].\nYAZIDIS EMBRACE ISLAM\nAfter this discussion and as we approach al-Malhamah al-Kubr\u0101 (the greatest battle before the Hour) \u2013 whenever its time comes by Allah\u2019s decree \u2013 it is interesting to note that slavery has been mentioned as one of the signs of the Hour as well as one of the causes behind al-Malhamah al-Kubr\u0101.\nRas\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  mentioned that one of the signs of the Hour was that \u201cthe slave girl gives birth to her master.\u201d This was  reported  by  al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b  and  Muslim  on the authority of Ab\u016b Hurayrah and by Muslim on the authority of \u2018Umar.\ndabiq\f", "schema:headline": "MY PROVISION WAS PLACED FOR ME IN THE SHADE OF MY SPEAR ", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "10"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah6", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah7", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq4-IN-THE-WORDS-OF-THE-ENEMY-", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "4", "schema:articleBody": "THE ENEMY\u2019S WORDS\n\u201c\nISIL poses a real threat to all countries in the Middle East, our European allies and to America.\nIn the last few months, the world has seen ISIL\u2019s barbarity up close as its fighters advanced across western and northern Iraq and slaughtered thousands of innocent civilians,  including  Sunni  and  Shia  Muslims  and Kurdish Iraqis and religious minorities.  ISIL\u2019s murder of two US journalists outraged the American people and exposed to the world the depravity of ISIL\u2019s ideology and tactics.  Over the weekend, we saw ISIL\u2019s murder of a British citizen. ISIL now controls a vast swath of eastern Syria and western and northern Iraq including towns and cities in all these areas.\nISIL has gained strength by exploiting the civil war in Syria and sectarian strife in Iraq.  And it has seized territory  across  both  countries  and  acquired  significant resources and advanced weapons. ISIL has employed a violent combination of terrorist, insurgent and conventional military tactics.\nISIL has been very adept at deploying technology and social media to increase its global profile and attract tens  of  thousands  of  fighters.  Its  goal  is  to  become the  new  vanguard  of  a  global  extremist  movement and establish an extremist Islamic caliphate across the Middle East. It considers itself the rightful inheritor of Osama bin Laden\u2019s legacy.\nWhile ISIL clearly poses an immediate threat to American  citizens  in  Iraq  and  our  interests  in  the  Middle East, we also know that thousands of foreign fighters, including  Europeans  and  more  than  100  Americans have travelled to Syria.  With passports that give them relative freedom of movement, these fighters can exploit ISIL\u2019s safe haven to plan, coordinate and carry out attacks against the United States and Europe.\nAlthough the intelligence community has not yet detected specific plotting against the US homeland, ISIL has  global  aspirations.  And  as  President  Obama  has made clear, ISIL\u2019s leaders have threatened America and our allies. If left unchecked, ISIL will directly threaten our homeland and our allies.\n\u201d\n\fSPECIAL\nTo Mom,\nI  do  not  have  much  time  and  will  probably  not get this opportunity again, so I would like to get straight to the point.\nYour recent public video of pleading to the Caliphate not to kill me has been received loud and clear by them. However, this in itself is not enough to save me. Although I\u2019ve been informed that the aerial campaign in Iraq has been halted, which at the moment has given me breathing room thanks be to God, I believe it looks like it\u2019s not enough Mom because Obama\u2019s recent decision to fly spy drones over Syria in the Islamic State\u2019s airspace is only aggravating and infuriating my captors further. This is obviously because the US government is interfering yet again in the affairs of the Islamic State. As for me being a journalist, they know this. I\u2019ve repeatedly told them this, but like they always say, do US airstrikes differentiate between those who are armed and those who are unarmed? Likewise they don\u2019t. Beseeching the Caliphate to spare my life will not help either of us, as the matter is in Obama\u2019s  next  judgment.  As  you  and  the  world have plainly seen in the recent video, the message was my life depends on Obama\u2019s next decision.\nMom, please don\u2019t let Obama kill me. Do not let him  get  away  with  murder  again.  What  doesn\u2019t our government understand? Don\u2019t get involved in the Islamic State\u2019s internal and external affairs. Leave them to fight their own war.\nMom, you can still save my life, just like the families of my previous cellmates who I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve met.  Pressure  our  government  to  not  involve themselves in the affairs of these people.\nAt the rate that Obama\u2019s administration is going, this could very well be the last you hear from me. Please don\u2019t let that be the case.

A country, I called it. I know nothing about nation building. I\u2019m so foolish I never even made it to university. But after dismissing some of the things I\u2019ve written in the past as \u201cISIS propaganda,\u201d many journalists and scholars in the West are now agreeing with this sentiment. The Islamic State, they say, is a genuine state.\nThis reality of the Caliphate is confirmed by many things, the people living under its governance, for one. For the first time in years, Muslims are living in security and their businesses  are  doing  a  roaring  trade.  The  zak\u0101h  system has been up and running, taking a percentage of peoples\u2019 wealth and dispersing it to the poor. The gold dinar coins \nfirst mentioned a year ago are now being minted, in preparation for their circulation. Shar\u012b\u2019ah courts are established in every city and are judging by the laws of Islam. Corruption, before an unavoidable fact of life in both Iraq and Syria, has been cut to virtually nil while crime rates have considerably tumbled.\nMeanwhile the Gulf states all around are in turmoil. They are  broken  by  religious  differences  and  fractured  by  ancient tribal feuds. The \u201cMiddle East \u2026 is broken, angry and so dysfunctional that it\u2019s in a class all by itself, giving new meaning to the word \u2018hopeless,\u2019\u201d wrote scholar Aaron David Miller in Foreign Policy on 11th September. \u201cIt is so torn apart and riven with sectarian, political, and religious hatreds and confrontations that it seems beyond the capacity of any external party to remedy.\u201d It\u2019s precisely for reasons like this that the Islamic State has arisen so fast and in such a short space of time. There is only one sect here, Sunni Islam, and the Caliph can only be from one tribe, Quraysh. Here in the Caliphate, there is no room for pluralism.\nIn an article published in The Telegraph on 8th June, Ruth Sherlock wrote, \u201cThe jihadists have become fastidious bu-\n4747\nPARADIGM SHIFT: PART II\n\f", "schema:headline": "YOU THINK THEY ARE TOGETHER, BUT THEIR HEARTS ARE DIVIDED", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "43"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq7-INTERVIEW-WITH-AB\u016a-\u2018UMAR-AL-BALJ\u012aK\u012a", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "INTERVIEW WITH  AB\u016a \u2018UMAR AL-BALJ\u012aK\u012a\nAB\u016a \u2018UMAR AL-BALJ\u012aK\u012a\nD\u0100BIQ: Why did you go to Belgium?\nAB\u016a  \u2018UMAR:  Alhamdulill\u0101h,  Allah  chose  me, Abuz-Zubayr  al-Balj\u012bk\u012b  (Kh\u0101lid),  and  Ab\u016b  Kh\u0101lid al-Balj\u012bk\u012b (Sufy\u0101n) to travel to Europe in order to terrorize  the  crusaders  waging  war  against  the Muslims.

What he is saying is that British Muslims make a great contribution to our country, that what is happening in terms of extremist terror has nothing to do with the true religion of Islam. It\u2019s being perverted by a minority who have been radicalized. Frankly, all of us have a responsibility to try and confront this  radicalization,  and  make  sure  we  stop young people being drawn into this poisonous, fanatical death cult that a very small minority of people have created.\u201d\nWow.\nTHE CRUSADER ERIC PICKLES\n\u201cBritish values are Muslim values,\u201d he blurted, clearly having no idea what he was talking about, before hastily adding that Islam\u2019s \u201cmessage of peace and unity\u201d makes the country better and stronger.\nWhat we have here are two people, politicians with a tremendous amount of power, who do not  have  the  slightest  idea  what  they\u2019re  on about. They clearly have little knowledge about Islam, the Shar\u012b\u2019ah, jih\u0101d, the muj\u0101hid\u012bn, or why Muslims are getting angrier and angrier about how the West arrogantly pushes and shoves its \ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "INTERVIEW WITH AB\u016a \u2018UMAR AL-BALJ\u012aK\u012a", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "72"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq11-WAL\u0100\u2019-AND-BAR\u0100\u2019-VERSUS-AMERICAN-RACISM", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "The  past  year  has  seen  a  number  of  high-profile  racerelated  incidents  dominate  the  headlines  in  America, bringing  the  topic  of  racism  back  into  the  spotlight across the country, and like most other major issues that take center stage in the crusader media, racism does not go ignored by the Muslim minority living in the lands of kufr. Their \u201cleaders\u201d address the issue with an effort to  give  the  topic  an  \u201cIslamic\u201d  flavor,  but  typically  fall short. When tackling the issue from such a perspective, \u201cIslamic\u201d  preachers  and  writers  often  do  so  with humanistic  undertones  that  seek  to  portray  Islam  as  a religion of peace that teaches Muslims to coexist with all. Deluded by the open-ended concept of \u201ctolerance,\u201d they cite numerous \u0101y\u0101t and ah\u0101d\u012bth that \u2013 rightfully so \u2013 serve to demonstrate that racial hatred has no place in Islam, but they do so for the purpose of advancing an agenda that attempts to \u201cIslamize\u201d more \u201cliberal\u201d concepts that the  kuff\u0101r  apply  across  the  board  for  achieving  evil, such  as  political  pluralism,  freedom  of  religion  ,  and acceptance of sodomites. In doing so, these \u201cdu\u2019\u0101t\u201d seek to encourage the k\u0101fir societies they live in to be more accepting of them, rather than meeting the enmity of the mushrik\u012bn with hatred and disavowal. They forego the concept of wal\u0101\u2019 and bar\u0101\u2019 (loyalty and disavowal for the cause of Allah), not bothering to educate their readers of the Muslim\u2019s obligation to reject kufr, separate himself from the kuff\u0101r, abandon their lands, harbor enmity and hatred towards them, and wage war against them until they submit to the truth.\n{There has already been for you an excellent pattern in Ibr\u0101h\u012bm  and  those  with  him,  when  they  said  to  their people,  \u201cIndeed,  we  are  disassociated  from  you  and from whatever you worship other than Allah. We have denied you, and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone\u201d} [Al-Mumtahanah: 4].\nThe example of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \uf06e and those with him \u2013 meaning the prophets of Allah, as mentioned by the scholars of tafs\u012br \u2013 which was praised by Allah as being an excellent example  for  us  to  follow,  is  for  one  to  be  prepared  to reject his own people when they fall into kufr and shirk, and not to remain attached to them on account of tribal or blood ties. If this is the case with one\u2019s own people with whom a common lineage is shared, how much more so in the case of those with whom one shares nothing more than a superficial characteristic such as skin color!\nThus,  the  correct  way  to  approach  the  issue  of  racism from an Islamic perspective is to reassert the importance and significance of wal\u0101\u2019 and bar\u0101\u2019, and to state in clear and unequivocal terms that those who wage war against \nIslam and the Muslims will not be spared on account of their skin color or ethnicity. The fate of a k\u0101fir waging war against the Muslims is one and the same across the entire racial spectrum \u2013 slaughter.\nThe  reason  for  this  is  simple:  A  Muslim\u2019s  loyalty  is determined, not by his skin color, his tribal affiliation, or his last name, but by his faith. He loves those whom Allah loves and hates those whom Allah hates. He forges alliances for the cause of Allah and breaks relations for the cause of Allah. \nThe  mufassir  of  the  Ummah,  \u2018Abdull\u0101h  Ibn  \u2018Abb\u0101s  \uf06b said,  \u201cLove  for  the  sake  of  Allah,  hate  for  the  sake  of Allah, make allegiance for the sake of Allah, and make enemies  for  the  sake  of  Allah,  for  the  wil\u0101yah  (loving guardianship) of Allah is not attained except by this. One will  not  find  the  taste  of  \u012bm\u0101n,  even  if  his  prayer  and fasting is great, until he is like this\u201d [Reported by Ibn alMub\u0101rak in \u201cAz-Zuhd\u201d and by al-L\u0101lik\u0101\u2019\u012b].\nThis  statement  of  Ibn  \u2018Abb\u0101s  echoes  that  made  by  the Prophet  \uf067  when  declaring  wal\u0101\u2019  and  bar\u0101\u2019  to  be  the strongest bond of faith. Al-Bar\u0101\u2019 Ibn \u2018\u0100zib \uf068 said that they were sitting with the Prophet \uf067 when he \uf067 asked, \u201cWhat bond of Islam is the strongest?\u201d They said, \u201cThe prayer.\u201d He \uf067 said, \u201cIt is good, but it is not it.\u201d They said, \u201cThe zak\u0101h.\u201d He \uf067 said, \u201cIt is good, but it is not it.\u201d They said, \u201cFasting Ramad\u0101n.\u201d He \uf067 said, \u201cIt is good, but it is not it.\u201d They said, \u201cThe hajj.\u201d He \uf067 said, \u201cIt is good, but it is not it.\u201d They said, \u201cJih\u0101d.\u201d He \uf067 said, \u201cIt is good, but it is not it. Indeed, the strongest bond of Islam is to love for the sake of Allah and hate for the sake of Allah\u201d [Reported by Im\u0101m Ahmad and others].\nIt was this principle \u2013 the strongest and most firm bond of Islam \u2013 that led Ab\u016b Bakr as-Sidd\u012bq \uf068 to spend an enormous  quantity  of  wealth  in  order  to  purchase  the Ethiopian slave Bil\u0101l \uf068 and set him free. When Bil\u0101l\u2019s owner  Umayyah  ridiculed  Ab\u016b  Bakr  at  the  conclusion of the transaction stating that he would have sold him for  one  tenth  of  the  price  they\u2019d  agreed  on,  Ab\u016b  Bakr retorted that if Umayyah had demanded ten times the agreed price he would have paid it. Years later, Ab\u016b Bakr and 300 other Arabs would march forth in the Battle of Badr  alongside  the  former  Ethiopian  slave  striking  the necks of their own people. That day would be referred thereafter  as  the  Day  of  Furq\u0101n,  the  day  that  Allah divided between truth and falsehood at the hands of a people who slay and imprison their own people for the cause of Allah. No day before it made it more clear that all past affiliations were broken, leaving only one bond remaining \u2013 the bond between a believing Muslim and \ndabiq\n\fquoted above as well as in the discussion between Salamah Ibn  al-Akwa\u2019  \uf068  and  al-Hajj\u0101j  on  becoming  a  Bedouin after  hijrah  [Reported  by  al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b  and  Muslim],  in addition  to  other  ah\u0101d\u012bth  and  \u0101th\u0101r,  returning  to  the desert as a Bedouin is referred to with the word root of \u201criddah.\u201d Ibn al-Ath\u012br commented, \u201cThey [the Salaf] used to consider the person who after his hijrah returns to his homeland without excuse like a murtadd\u201d [An-Nih\u0101yah]. This is probably because such a person \u2013 in some regards \u2013  forsakes  aspects  of  Islam  including  hearing,  obeying, jam\u0101\u2019ah, jih\u0101d, mas\u0101jid, etc. \nAnd  according  to  some  scholars,  moving  to  d\u0101rul-kufr from D\u0101rul-Isl\u0101m is apostasy, whereas others confirm that it borders apostasy.\nMany Syrians died on the roadto d\u0101rul-kufr\nIbn Mas\u2019\u016bd \uf068 said, \u201cThe taker, giver, and contractor of rib\u0101 \u2013 if they know the deal is rib\u0101 \u2013 as well as the giver and receiver of tattoos for beauty, the abandoner of zak\u0101h, and the revert to being a Bedouin after hijrah are all cursed upon  the  tongue  of  Muhammad  \uf067  until  Resurrection Day\u201d [Reported by an-Nas\u0101\u2019\u012b from Ibn Mas\u2019\u016bd].\nIbn  Hazm  said,  \u201cIf  he  moves  there  [the  lands  of  the crusaders  and  pagans]  for  the  sake  of  what  he  might acquire from duny\u0101 but lives there like a dhimm\u012b \u2013 despite being able to join the body of the Muslims and reach their land \u2013 then his deed is not far from kufr and we find no excuse for him\u201d [Al-Muhall\u0101].\nThe  Prophet  \uf067  said,  \u201cThe  muh\u0101jir  can  stay  three  days in Makkah after completing his [\u2018Umrah or Hajj] rites\u201d [Reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim from al-\u2018Al\u0101\u2019 Ibn alHadram\u012b].\nAl-Hasan Ibn Hayy (died 169AH) said, \u201cIf a man moves to  d\u0101rul-harb  without  apostatizing  from  Islam,  he  is  a murtadd for abandoning D\u0101rul-Isl\u0101m\u201d [Mukhtasar Ikhtil\u0101f al-\u2018Ulam\u0101\u2019 \u2013 at-Tah\u0101w\u012b].\n\u2018Al\u012b  Ibn  Ab\u012b T\u0101lib  \uf068  said,  \u201cIndeed,  the  major  sins  are seven.\u201d The people were noisy, so he repeated his statement three times and then said, \u201cWill you not ask me about them?\u201d They said, \u201cO Am\u012brul-Mu\u2019min\u012bn, what are they?\u201d He replied, \u201cShirk, murder, defaming the chaste woman, taking the wealth of the orphan, taking rib\u0101, fleeing from battle,  and  going  back  to  the  desert  as  a  Bedouin  after hijrah\u201d [Reported by at-Tabar\u012b in his tafs\u012br].\nAl-Q\u0101d\u012b  \u2018Iy\u0101d  said,  \u201cThe  Ummah  has  ijm\u0101\u2019  on  the prohibition  of  the  muh\u0101jir  abandoning  his  hijrah  and returning  to  his  homeland  and  that  the  muh\u0101jir  going back  to  being  a  Bedouin  is  a  major  sin\u201d  [Sharh  Sah\u012bh Muslim \u2013 an-Nawaw\u012b].\nIbn  Hajar  said  while  commenting  on  the  had\u012bth  of  al\u2018Al\u0101\u2019  Ibn  al-Hadram\u012b  quoted  above,  \u201cFrom  the  fiqh  of this  had\u012bth  is  that  residence  in  Makkah  was  har\u0101m  for those who performed hijrah from it before the Conquest of Makkah. But it was permissible for one who intended it for Hajj or \u2018Umrah to remain there for not more than three days after completing his rites\u201d [Fath al-B\u0101r\u012b].\nIt is important to note that in the had\u012bth of Ibn Mas\u2019\u016bd \uf068 \nGoing  back  to  d\u0101rul-kufr  is  certainly  a  major  sin  that can reach the level of apostasy if it entails, for example, voluntarily  moving  to  a  land  where  the  person  will  be forced  into  kufr,  as  the  excuse  of  coercion  is  not  valid when the individual brings this condition upon himself. Similarly is the case if he agrees to stipulations of kufr \u2013 such as cooperating with the kuff\u0101r against the Muslims \u2013 so as to be permitted entry into d\u0101rul-kufr. This is kufr even if he does not go through with his promise. {Have you not considered those who practice hypocrisy, saying to their brothers who have disbelieved among the People of the Book, \u201cIf you are expelled, we will surely leave with you, and we will not obey, in regard to you, anyone \u2013 ever; and if you are fought, we will surely aid you.\u201d But Allah testifies that they are liars. If they are expelled, they will not leave with them, and if they are fought, they will not aid them. And [even] if they should aid them, they will surely turn their backs; then [thereafter] they will not be aided} [Al-Hashr: 11-12]. And there are many other acts of kufr that one can potentially fall into when travelling to d\u0101rul-kufr.\nMay Allah facilitate for the Muslims hijrah to the Khil\u0101fah despite the plots of the crusaders and the apostates.\ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "WAL\u0100\u2019 AND BAR\u0100\u2019 VERSUS AMERICAN RACISM", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "18"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq7-ADVICE-FOR-THE-LEADERS-OF-THE-ISLAMIC-STATE", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "ADVICE FOR THE LEADERS OF THE ISLAMIC STATE\nPraise be to Allah, and may blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah, and upon his family and those who support him. As for what follows\u2026\nMy dear muj\u0101hid brother, these are some pieces of advice that I\u2019ve gathered from the mouths of men and the pages of books, although I do not claim to be a man of wisdom. I ask Allah to make you and me benefit from these pieces of advice. And Allah knows all intentions. [1]  Have  sincerity  towards  Allah,  for  it  will lead  to  salvation  in  the  worldly  life  and  the Hereafter. Allah\u2019s Messenger (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) said, \u201cAllah has guaranteed the one who  performs  jih\u0101d  for  His  cause,  having  left his home for no reason other than to perform jih\u0101d for His cause and to affirm the truth of His words, that He would enter him into Jannah or return him back home with all the rewards he has attained or the ghan\u012bmah he has acquired.\u201d\nLet  the  goal  of  your  deed  be  that  the  word of  Allah  becomes  the  highest,  for  Ab\u016b  M\u016bsa said,  \u201cAllah\u2019s  Messenger  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa sallam) was asked about a man who fights out of bravery, out of zeal, or out of riy\u0101\u2019 (showing off), which of these is fighting for Allah\u2019s cause? So  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa sallam) said, \u2018Whoever fights so that the word of  Allah  is  the  highest  is  fighting  for  Allah\u2019s cause.\u2019\u201d [2] Be just and sincere towards your subjects, for  \u201cNo  man  is  appointed  to  lead  ten  people except that he will be brought forth in shackles on the Day of Judgment, and will either be set free on account of his justice or destroyed as a result of his oppression.\u201d Likewise, \u201cAny leader who takes charge of the affairs of the Muslims and  then  doesn\u2019t  strive  for  them  and  advise them,  will  not  enter  Jannah  with  them.\u201d  And likewise, \u201cAllah does not give one of His slaves leadership,  who  then  dies  having  cheated  his subjects,  except  that  Allah  will  make  Jannah prohibited for him.\u201d\n10 ARTICLE10 ARTICLE\n[3] Seek consultation and hold discussions, for discussion is the partner of consultation. One should sit in a gathering to exchange ideas, then each  person  comments  on  the  opinions  put forth by the others, or puts forth a new opinion, and  at  the  end  of  the  gathering  the  correct opinion  will  become  clear.  Allah  (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101)  said, {And consult them concerning the matter} [\u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 159]. Allah has directed His Prophet to consult those under him despite the Prophet\u2019s prudent intellect. So what about you?\nAnd  as  was  reported,  \u201cOne  who  seeks consultation will have no regret, and one who prays  istikh\u0101rah  will  not  go  wrong.\u201d  And  it\u2019s been  said,  \u201cHe  who  relies  exclusively  on  his intellect will go astray, and he who is content with his own opinion will slip up, and he who consults  intelligent  men  will  take  the  correct path, and he who seeks the help of a man with insight will attain what is hoped for.\u201d\nSo  let  every  leader  have  a  true  consultative council beginning with the general leader and ending with the detachment commanders. But do not consult a person who has a certain need that he is seeking to fulfill, nor a person whom you sense desires to be consulted, nor a person who doesn\u2019t think his opinions through, for it\u2019s been said, \u201cLeave your opinion until it ripens.\u201d It was reported that \u2018Al\u012b said, \u201cThe opinion of an elder is better than the view of a young man,\u201d meaning  with  regards  to  battle.  And  don\u2019t consult  anyone  unless  he\u2019s  alone,  meaning that you should consult him in private, for this ensures more secrecy and is a greater deterrent to  anyone  who  might  otherwise  disclose  the issue.\nIt is true! \u201cConsultation and discussion are two doors to mercy, and two keys to blessings. No opinion  that\u2019s  been  reached  with  the  help  of these two things will go wrong.\u201d\n[4]  Beware  of  only  consulting  a  person  who always  agrees  with  your  opinion,  and  beware of  bad  company.  Get  accustomed  to  being \n\fwhom  Allah  does  not  guide  is  deviant,  anyone whom He does not decree wellbeing for is afflicted, and anyone whom Allah does not aid is abandoned. So whomever Allah guides is guided and whomever He leaves astray is deviant. Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) said, {He whom  Allah  guides  is  the  guided,  but  he  whom He  leaves  astray  \u2013  never  will  you  find  for  him  a protecting guide} [Al-Kahf: 17], and no deed will be accepted  from  him  in  the  Duny\u0101  until  he  accepts Him. And no repentance or ransom will be accepted from him in the Hereafter. It has reached me that some of you turned back from their religion after accepting  Islam  and  acting  in  accordance  with  it, out of delusion about Allah, ignorance of His affair, and in response to Shayt\u0101n. Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) said, {And [mention] when We said to the angels, \u201cProstrate to \u0100dam,\u201d and they prostrated, except for Ibl\u012bs. He was of the jinn and departed from the command of his Lord. Then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than Me while they are enemies to you? Wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange} [Al-Kahf:  50].  And  He  said,  {Indeed,  Shayt\u0101n  is  an enemy  to  you;  so  take  him  as  an  enemy.  He  only invites his party to be among the companions of the Blaze} [F\u0101tir: 6]. I have sent to you so and so [Kh\u0101lid Ibn  al-Wal\u012bd]  with  an  army  of  the  Muh\u0101jir\u012bn,  the Ans\u0101r,  and  their  good  followers,  and  I\u2019ve  ordered him to not fight anyone or kill anyone until he calls him  to  the  call  of  Allah.  Whoever  answers  him, accepts the truth, halts his evil, and does good, my envoy will accept this from him and will aid him in it. If he refuses, I\u2019ve ordered him to wage war against them over their refusal, to not spare anyone he is able to kill, to burn them alive with fire, to kill them in a severe manner using all means, to enslave their women  and  children,  and  to  not  accept  from  any one of them anything but Islam. Whoever follows it, then it is best for him. And whoever leaves it, then he cannot incapacitate Allah. I\u2019ve ordered my envoy to read this message in every gathering of yours and the signal is the adh\u0101n. [I\u2019ve said to my army] if the Muslims perform adh\u0101n and they [the apostates] do not perform adh\u0101n, then rush to kill them. And if they [the apostates] perform adh\u0101n, then restrain yourselves from attacking them until you ask them to deliver what is obligatory upon them [the zak\u0101h]. If they refuse, then rush to kill them.

So I say, you dealt with the secularists and assented to them,  with  the  crusaders  and  conceded  to  them, with the Americans and gave them guarantees, with the Israelis and recognized the submissive treaties with them, with Mub\u0101rak\u2019s army who were raised upon American aid and you assented to them, and \nIF I WERE IN THE PLACE OF MORSI AND SAT ON THE KURS\u012a [THRONE]\n BY HUS\u0100M \u2018ABDUR-RA\u2019\u016aF\n[T\u0101r\u012bkh at-Tabar\u012b; Al-Bid\u0101yah wan-Nih\u0101yah]\nA DEVIANT BOOK WRITTEN BY A TOP LEADER OF AL-Q\u0100\u00b4IDAH!\n18 HISTORY\n\f", "schema:headline": "ADVICE FOR THE LEADERS OF THE ISLAMIC STATE", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "9"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq13-IN-THE-WORDS-OF-THE-ENEMY", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "13", "schema:articleBody": "\u201cISIS poses a major threat to the U.S. and to U.S. interests abroad, and that threat is growing every day. The nature and significance of the threat flow from the fact that ISIS is \u2013 all at the same time \u2013 a terrorist group, a state and a revolutionary political movement. We have never faced an adversary like it.\u201d\n\u201cAs a terrorist group, ISIS poses a threat to the homeland. That threat is largely indirect and involves ISIS\u2019s ability to radicalize  young  Americans  to  conduct  attacks  here.  The FBI has over 900 open investigations into homegrown extremists, the vast majority radicalized by ISIS, and a large number  of  those  investigations  relate  to  individuals  who may be plotting here\u2026\u201d\n\u201c[T]he potential exists for the quantity of \u2026 [homegrown] attacks to be large. The number of ISIS followers dwarfs the number of followers that al-Qaeda ever had. Over time, the indirect threat, if not significantly degraded, will become a direct one \u2013 that is, ISIS will have the ability to plan and direct attacks on the homeland from the group\u2019s safe havens in Iraq and Syria, just like it did in Paris.\u201d\n\u201cSuch attacks are deeply concerning because they carry the potential to be much more sophisticated and complex \u2013 and therefore more dangerous \u2013 than homegrown attacks, again,  just  like  in  Paris  recently,  or  London  in  2005  or even 9/11. And in news that should get everyone\u2019s attention, ISIS has shown an interest in weapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n\u201cThe attacks in Paris were the first manifestation of an effort by ISIS to put together an attack capability in Europe \u2013 an effort it began less than a year ago. The head of the U.K.\u2019s domestic security agency recently warned that ISIS is now planning mass-casualty attacks in Britain. His concerns are well-founded. We will not be far behind.\u201d\n\u201cAs a state, ISIS poses a threat to regional stability \u2013 a threat to the very territorial integrity of the current nation-states, a threat to inflame the entire region in sectarian war\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAs a revolutionary political movement, ISIS is gaining affiliates among extremist groups around the world. They are signing up for what ISIS desires as its objective: a global caliphate where day-to-day life is governed by extreme religious views. In the mind of ISIS, its global caliphate would extend to the U.S.\u201d\n\u201cWhen they join ISIS, these affiliates evolve from focusing on local issues to focusing on establishing an extension of the caliphate. And their targets evolve from local to international ones. This is the story of the bombing of the Russian airline by an ISIS group in the Egyptian Sinai.\u201d\n\u201cISIS  has  gained  affiliates  faster  than  al-Qaeda  ever  did. From none a year ago, there are now militant groups that have sworn allegiance to ISIS in nearly 20 countries. They have conducted attacks that have killed Americans, and they carry the potential to grab large amounts of territory\u2026\u201d\nMorell ended his article saying:\n\u201cMr. President, the downing of the Russian airliner and the attacks in Paris make it crystal clear that our ISIS strategy is not working.\u201d\nYes, the crusader strategy is not working because the Islamic State is here to stay. It is a state that inflicts just terror against its infidel, pagan, and apostate enemies. And it will continue to expand until its banner flutters over Constantinople and Rome. Until then, let the crusaders get used to the sound of explosion and the image of carnage in their very own homelands.\nSan  Bernardino  was  not  the  first, and by Allah\u2019s permission it will not be  the  last\n\fThis month, D\u0101biq interviewed the W\u0101l\u012b of Khur\u0101s\u0101n Shaykh  H\u0101fidh  Sa\u2019\u012bd  Kh\u0101n  (hafidhahull\u0101h)  and  asked him  several  questions  regarding  the  Wil\u0101yah  and  the situation on the ground there. We present the interview below.\nD\u0101biq: How is the situation in Wil\u0101yat Khur\u0101s\u0101n? Does the Islamic State have territory there with tamk\u012bn (consolidation)? Are the visible aspects of tamk\u012bn there similar to what is manifest in Sh\u0101m and Iraq?\nThe W\u0101l\u012b: Alhamdulill\u0101h, the situation in Khur\u0101s\u0101n brings good  tidings,  by  Allah\u2019s  permission.  We  have  achieved tamk\u012bn in the Wil\u0101yah, but not on the same level as Iraq and Sh\u0101m in terms of the magnitude of territory on the ground. The lands of Khur\u0101s\u0101n are very vast and include \u201cAfghanistan,\u201d western \u201cPakistan,\u201d and other lands that the murtadd\u012bn had taken over. We have conquered and gained consolidation in five \u201cadministrative regions\u201d here, walhamdulill\u0101h, and in terms of the visible aspects of tamk\u012bn, we \u2013 by Allah\u2019s grace \u2013 establish Allah\u2019s law therein and implement the hud\u016bd. We have established judicial courts in these regions, offices for hisbah, offices for zak\u0101h, and others for education, da\u2019wah and mas\u0101jid, and public services. We set up a specific division for every shar\u2019\u012b and administrative duty therein and appointed qualified and specialized officials based on the personnel available from amongst the muh\u0101jir\u012bn and ans\u0101r in the Wil\u0101yah.\nThe hisbah in Wil\u0101yat Khur\u0101s\u0101n leveling graves\nD\u0101biq: What is the importance of Wil\u0101yat Khur\u0101s\u0101n to Islam and the Muslims? What are the difficulties the Wil\u0101yah faces?\nThe W\u0101l\u012b: Wil\u0101yat Khur\u0101s\u0101n has great importance to Islam and the Muslims. It had once been under the authority of the Muslims, along with the regions surrounding it. Afterwards, the secularist and R\u0101fid\u012b murtadd\u012bn conquered some  of  these  regions,  and  the  cow-worshipping  Hindus and atheist Chinese conquered other nearby regions, as is the case in parts of Kashmir and Turkistan. So the Wil\u0101yah, \nby Allah\u2019s permission, is a gate to re-conquering all these regions until they are ruled once more by Allah\u2019s law, and so the territory of the blessed Khil\u0101fah is expanded.\nAlso, the people of Khur\u0101s\u0101n in general love Islam and warfare, and because of this, the region has a dormant force for supporting tawh\u012bd and jih\u0101d. Thus, as the reality of the Khil\u0101fah becomes more clear to the people of Khur\u0101s\u0101n, they will join the Wil\u0101yah at a greater rate and strengthen its jih\u0101d against the enemies of Islam and the Muslims, including the kuff\u0101r, the murtadd\u012bn, and those who ally with them inside and outside the region. As such, they will be a strong building block for the Khil\u0101fah in this part of the world. And the coming generations will be raised upon the Book and the Sunnah from a young age. This is a tremendous grace that has reached this region by way of this khil\u0101fah, which is upon the prophetic methodology, and by way of our im\u0101m and khal\u012bfah, Ab\u016b Bakr al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b al-Qurash\u012b.\nAs for the difficulties, then they are nothing but the t\u0101gh\u016bt enemies of Allah \u2013 including \u201cPakistan\u201d on one side, and \u201cAfghanistan\u201d  on  the  other  \u2013  standing  with  their  armies and intelligence agencies against Islam, its khil\u0101fah, and the wil\u0101yah that represents it and implements its methodology in the region. These two governments attempt to create  many  problems  in  order  to  obstruct  the  jih\u0101d  of  the Wil\u0101yah and thereby hinder the establishment of Islam and its methodology in the region. They attempt to stop the expansion  of  the  Khil\u0101fah.  Such  is  also  the  condition  of those organizations that these two governments produce, support, or take advantage of, and to whom they extend aid, and for whom they pave the way. This leads these organizations, such as the nationalist Taliban movement, to instigate various problems in order to wage war against the Khil\u0101fah. But how impossible it is for all these organizations and others to extinguish the light of Allah! For this is a khil\u0101fah that rose upon the prophetic methodology and upon the foundation of tawh\u012bd, thus all these taw\u0101gh\u012bt together will not be able to stand before its lions \u2013 the lions of tawh\u012bd and \u2018aq\u012bdah. The taw\u0101gh\u012bt succeeded against the \u201cIslamic\u201d organizations and movements that held flimsy creeds and deficient methodologies, whether they were \u201cda\u2019wah\u201d-oriented or \u201cjih\u0101d\u201d-oriented. As for the Khil\u0101fah, it is a thorn \u2013 rather, an axe! \u2013 in the necks of the kuff\u0101r and murtadd\u012bn in this region, by Allah\u2019s power and strength.\nD\u0101biq: Does the nationalist Taliban movement have areas of consolidation in Khur\u0101s\u0101n? And do they rule them by Allah\u2019s law?\nThe  W\u0101l\u012b:  The  nationalist  Taliban  movement  only  has control  of  some  regions  of  \u201cAfghanistan,\u201d  nowhere  else. As for ruling them by Allah\u2019s law, then it does not do that. Rather, they rule by tribal customs and judge affairs in accordance with the desires and traditions of the people, tra-\n\f", "schema:headline": "IN THE WORDS OF THE ENEMY", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "46"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq11-THE-ALLIES-OF-AL-Q\u0100\u2019IDAH-IN-SH\u0100M:-PART-4", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "that from the nullifiers of Islam was \u201cbacking  and  aiding  the  mushrik\u012bn against the Muslims.

They are also divided about their duny\u0101 and they consider this good. So he \uf067 came with unity regarding the religion with Allah\u2019s statement, {He has ordained for you  of  religion  what  He  enjoined  upon  N\u016bh  and  that which We have revealed to you, and what We enjoined upon  Ibr\u0101h\u012bm  and  M\u016bs\u0101  and  \u2018\u012as\u0101  \u2013  to  establish  the religion  and  not  be  divided  therein}  [Ash-Sh\u016br\u0101:  13]. Allah \uf063 also said, {Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become sects \u2013 you have nothing to do with them}  [Al-An\u2019\u0101m:  159].  He  also  prohibited  us  from being like them with Allah\u2019s statement, {And do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them. And those will have a great punishment} [\u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 105]. He also prohibited us from dividing about the duny\u0101 with Allah\u2019s statement, {And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do  not  become  divided}  [\u0100l  \u2018Imr\u0101n:  103].  The  third of these matters is that they considered disobeying the person in authority and refusing to yield to him a virtue. They considered hearing and obeying him humiliation and  disgrace.  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  \uf067  opposed  them  and ordered his companions to be patient with the injustices of the rulers2. He ordered them to hear and obey them and give them sincere advice. He was severe about this, expressed it, and repeated it. These three matters he \uf067 gathered together in the had\u012bth reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and  Muslim,  \u2018Allah  is  pleased  with  three  matters  for you, that you worship Him and not associate anything with Him in worship, that you hold to the rope of Allah together  and  not  divide,  and  that  you  sincerely  advise those whom Allah gives authority over you.\u2019 No calamity occurred  in  the  people\u2019s  religion  and  duny\u0101  except  by violation  of  these  three  principles  or  some  of  them\u201d [Mas\u0101\u2019il al-J\u0101hiliyyah].\nHe  \uf072  also  said,  \u201cFrom  the  most  amazing  things  and greatest  signs  showing  the  power  of  Allah  \uf063  are  six principles  that  He  \uf063  made  very  clear  more  so  than what  the  doubtful  people  think.  Thereafter,  many  of the  \u2018intelligent\u2019  people  of  the  world  and  \u2018wise\u2019  men  of mankind erred about these principles, except for a very few.  \u2026  The  second  principle  [after  the  obligation  of tawh\u012bd  and  prohibition  of  shirk]  is  that  Allah  ordered with unity regarding the religion and prohibited division within it. Allah clarified this with clear and conclusive evidence that the laymen can understand. He prohibited us from being like those who divided before us and thus were  destroyed.  He  also  mentioned  that  He  ordered the  Messengers  with  unity  regarding  the  religion  and 2 He refers to Muslim rulers who rule by the Shar\u012b\u2019ah but commit injustices, not rulers who apostatize by legislating, executing, or judging by manmade laws, nor rulers who have wal\u0101\u2019 to the crusaders against the Muslims.\nprohibited  them  from  division  within  it.  What  makes this  clearer  is  what  the  Sunnah  came  with  of  amazing teachings in this regards. Then the matter changed until division  over  the  fundamentals  and  branches  of  the religion  became  \u2018knowledge\u2019  and  \u2018fiqh  of  the  religion\u2019! And  then  no  one  called  to  the  obligation  to  unite regarding the religion except for a \u2018zind\u012bq\u2019 or \u2018madman\u2019! The third principle is that the fulfillment of unity is by hearing and obeying he who has been granted authority over  us  even  if  he  might  be  an  Ethiopian  slave.  Allah clarified this prevalently and sufficiently through various kinds of shar\u2019\u012b and qadar\u012b evidences. It then became the fundamental  not  known  to  most  of  the  claimants  of knowledge. What then of acting in accordance with this matter!\u201d [Six Great Beneficial Fundamentals].\nAnd  although  jam\u0101\u2019ah  is  from  the  most  obvious  of obligations with even the fitrah of many animals being inclined to it, the modern claimants of Islam argue that it is better for the Ummah to have religious and political pluralism!  They  prefer  that  Ahlus-Sunnah  tolerate  the various  sects  of  bid\u2019ah  and  even  apostasy  who  claim to belong to the Muslim Ummah. They also wish that Ahlus-Sunnah  would  permit  the  existence  of  deviant, warring, and selfish political parties and militant factions on the liberated Muslim lands! They made taql\u012bd (blind following)  of  their  partisan,  evil  \u201cscholars\u201d  an  essential aspect of \u201creligion.\u201d And through this, they propagated the  \u201cvirtue\u201d  of  division  and  denounced  the  \u201cevil\u201d  of jam\u0101\u2019ah  in  their  campaign  against  the  revived  body  of Islam, the Khil\u0101fah. How wicked are the deviant parties and corrupt \u201cscholars\u201d!\nTherefore  know  \u2013  may  Allah  have  mercy  upon  you  \u2013 that  the  major  basis  for  the  religions  of  the  J\u0101hiliyyah was taql\u012bd. After Im\u0101m Muhammad Ibn \u2018Abdil-Wahh\u0101b \uf072  mentioned  the  first  three  aspects  of  their  religion (shirk, religious division, and political disunity), he said, \u201cThe fourth matter is that their religion is based upon principles, the greatest of which is taql\u012bd. It is the major principle for all the kuff\u0101r, the first of them and last of them, as Allah \uf063 said, {And similarly, We did not send before you any warner into a city except that its affluent said, \u201cIndeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are, in their footsteps, following\u201d} [Az-Zukhruf: 23]. He \uf063 also said, {And when it is said to them, \u201cFollow what Allah has revealed,\u201d they say, \u201cRather, we will follow that upon which we found our fathers.\u201d Even if Shayt\u0101n was inviting them to the punishment of Hellfire?} [Luqm\u0101n: 21]. So he \uf067 came to them with Allah\u2019s statement, {Say, \u201cI only advise you of one thing \u2013 that you stand for Allah, [seeking truth] in pairs and individually, and then give thought.\u201d There is not in your companion any madness. \ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "THE ALLIES OF AL-Q\u0100\u2019IDAH IN SH\u0100M: PART 4", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "6"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq10-FOREWORD", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "Muslims who set out to answer Shaykh al-\u2018Adn\u0101n\u012b\u2019s call to defend the Khil\u0101fah often find themselves marching forward alone, with none to rely on for support in their efforts  to  defend  the  Shar\u012b\u2019ah  except  Allah.  The  jih\u0101d claimants, on the other hand, are relatively large groups of well-armed fighters that have the ability to take and hold  territory  and  impose  their  will.

The  cowardly  jih\u0101d  claimants,  in  comparison, with  their  large  numbers,  heavy  weaponry,  and    their claim of some regions of Sh\u0101m, are nonetheless afraid of implementing the Shar\u012b\u2019ah lest they offend the people, therefore choosing instead to pursue the pleasure of the people over the pleasure of Allah.\nAllah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 said, \u201cWhoever pleases Allah at the expense of angering the people, Allah will be sufficient for him against the people\u2019s harm, and whoever pleases the  people  at  the  expense  of  angering  Allah,  Allah will  [abandon  him  and]  leave  his  affair  to  the  people\u201d [Reported by at-Tirmidh\u012b from \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah].\nThus we renew our call to the sincere Muslims around the world to march forth and wage war against the crusaders and apostates who seek to wipe out the Shar\u012b\u2019ah. March forth, neither fearing the blame of the critics, nor seeking the pleasure of the people, for the hukm belongs to Allah, not the people.\n{Legislation is not but for Allah} [Y\u016bsuf: 40].\nThe crusader nation of Britainmourns its dead citizens\nThe scene outside the targeted R\u0101fid\u012b temple in Kuwait\nAb\u016b Sulaym\u0101n al-Muwahhid (may Allah accept him)\nAb\u016b Yahy\u0101 al-Qayraw\u0101n\u012b (may Allah accept him)\nday?

In  contrast,  the jih\u0101d claimants in Sh\u0101m and other regions are prepared to sacrifice the principles of the religion and wage war against the Islamic State in defense of a j\u0101hil\u012b nationalism coated  with  a  thin  veneer  of  \u201cShar\u012b\u2019ah,\u201d  knowing  full well  that  should  they  succeed  in  taking  any  territory from  the  Khil\u0101fah,  that  territory  would  no  longer  be ruled by Allah\u2019s pure Shar\u012b\u2019ah.\nTo  further  demonstrate  the  disgraceful  nature  of  these jih\u0101d  claimants,  one  only  needs  to  take  note  that  the \n4 FOREWORD\n\fgood question,\u2019 said Joshua Landis, a Syria expert at  the  University  of  Oklahoma  who\u2019s  written about  Alloush.  Alloush  and  his  staff  \u2018are  getting much  more  savvy,\u2019  he  said,  based  on  Twitter conversations  he\u2019s  had  with  the  commander\u2019s spokesman.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Everybody is aware now that the regime is very weak  and  on  the  way  to  collapse,\u2019  said  Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat who lives in Washington. \u2018And every major player wants to be acceptable  to  the  West  and  to  the  international community.\u2019\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Zahran  wants  to  be  on  the  winning  side,\u2019  he said.\u201d\n\u201cLandis said Alloush would be there. \u2018He\u2019s going to be a winner,\u2019 he said. Alloush\u2019s Army of Islam and other  Islamist  groups,  the  \u2018hard-bitten  patriotic types \u2026 will win in the end,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\u201cPresenting a new face may be one reason Alloush traveled  to  Istanbul,  where  he  was  interviewed, and  was  heading  next  to  Jordan  to  confer  with rebel commanders who operate in southern Syria, as well as their international backers. His fighters need weapons.\u201d\n\u201cIn his interview with McClatchy, he adhered to the moderate line: \u2018If we succeed in toppling the regime,  we  will  leave  it  to  the  Syrian  people  to choose the form of state they want,\u2019 he said. \u2018As for coexistence with minorities, this has been the situation in Syria for hundreds of years. We are not seeking to impose our power on minorities or to practice oppression against them. On the contrary, we have criticized the regime and fought it because it was practicing sectarian discrimination against the majority during the eras it ruled Syria.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cAnother  aide  said  that  Alloush,  to  improve  his image, was ready to dispense with the black and white Islamic flag and adopt the Syrian flag used by other rebel forces.\u201d\n\u201c[Zahran]  said  the  Army  of  Islam  had  been  in direct touch with Daniel Rubinstein, the Obama \nadministration\u2019s  special  envoy assertion the State Department confirmed.\u201d\nfor  Syria,  an \nThat  ends  the  words  of  Alloush\u2019s  allies.  To summarize:  He  believes  in  self-determination,  a cornerstone of democracy. He believes in freedom of religion and religious coexistence, a cornerstone of  secularist  nationalism.  And  he  compromises religious fundamentals, meets with Jewish leaders part  of  the  crusade  against  Islam,  and  raises banners  of  secularist  j\u0101hiliyyah  for  the  sake  of obtaining aid. And yet, Alloush has been one of the top allies of \u201cal-Q\u0101\u2019idah\u201d in Syria (the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front) \u2013 openly having praised both Jawl\u0101n\u012b and al-Har\u0101r\u012b  (a  major  leader  of  the  Jawl\u0101n\u012b  front) in  interviews  released  officially  by  his  \u201cArmy  of Islam.\u201d He himself has been praised by al-Har\u0101r\u012b via internet tweets.\nThe Jewish envoy Daniel Rubinstein,ally of Zahran Alloush\nAgain, the deviance of Alloush has been something known  to  these  jih\u0101d  claimants  long  before  this recent  interview  and  even  before  the  official expansion of the Islamic State to Sh\u0101m, and yet the  Jawl\u0101n\u012b  front  supported  the  \u201cIslamic  Front\u201d that  Alloush  led  in  the  war  against  the  Islamic State.1\nThis interview was followed by a declaration by the allies of the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front condemning the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front\u2019s killing of more than twenty apostate Druze 1 A former member of Jawl\u0101n\u012b\u2019s sh\u016br\u0101 council has also informed D\u0101biq that when Jawl\u0101n\u012b was ordered by Dhaw\u0101hir\u012b to join the apostate \u201cIslamic\u201d Front, he refused to do so, saying that Dhaw\u0101hir\u012b was unaware of the situation on the ground.

Less than two weeks later, they launched a surprise attack on Nusayri locations and fortifications  separating  between  the industrial  neighborhood  and  the neighborhood of Tahtuh. This came after one of the mujahidin created openings in the Nusayri line of defense using a bulldozer, paving the way  for  Islamic  State  infantrymen to stealthily advance and carry out a  surprise  attack.  They  succeeded in  capturing  several  points  where the murtaddin were entrenched after they fled in defeat. During the course of the same week, they carried out attacks on several Nusayri army locations in the neighborhood of Tahtuh and succeeded in capturing  them.\nBengal \u2013 On the 15th of Rajab, the soldiers of the Islamic State assassinated a university professor in the  city  of  Rajshahi  for  calling  to atheism.

It is just as the Lord said, explaining this phenomenon of the majority\u2019s rejection of the truth, \u201cAnd most of mankind refuse [to follow anything] but disbelief\u201d (Al-Isra 89).\nAs  is  well  known,  these  messengers did  not  come  empty-handed.  Each of  them  brought  with  him  a  message, often in the form of a scripture, something for the educated to read and comprehend, yet with the simple command of monotheistic worship of the Creator that even the illiterate could follow. So Moses  was  given  the Torah,  by  which the  Tribes  of  Israel  were  governed  for many  generations.  But  they  strayed from  its  original  message,  even  with their very own scribes changing its text, as the Tanakh1 testifies, \u201cHow can you say, \u2018We are wise, and the law (Torah) of the Lord is with us\u2019? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes has made it into a lie\u201d (Jeremiah 8:8).2 So then Jesus brought the Gospel, confirming what came before him of the Torah and permitting \u2013 by the permission  of  his  Lord  \u2013  some  of  what  was  forbidden therein. It was reported that he said, \u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them\u201d (Matthew 5:17). However, just as the Torah was not fully preserved, even altered, the Gospel was also corrupted. Its original would be lost, with the oldest related manuscripts written only as commentary to the original. So instead of having an altered \u201cGospel of Jesus,\u201d one finds the Gospel according to Matthew, then Mark, then Luke, then John, each with a unique take on various aspects of Jesus\u2019 teachings, sometimes outright contradicting one another. To say the least, the authentic scripture was lost and the people strayed.As per the divine way of the Lord, another messenger was sent to bring the lost flocks back to the path of righteousness. He would be the awaited Prophet foretold by Moses and the coming Advocate prophesied by Jesus. Moreover, he would bring a message hold-\n1  The Tanakh are the Jewish scriptures consisting of three parts: the Law (Torah), the Prophets, and the Writings.2  Due to ease of reading, the English Standard Version of the Bible is used herein unless otherwise noted.\ning the promise of divine protection and heralding its bearer as the Seal of the Prophets, the final messenger, sent not to the Tribes of Israel alone \u2013 but to all of mankind. For the same Lord who sent Moses and Jesus  also  sent  Muhammad,  about  whom  He  said, \u201cMuhammad is not the father of any of your men, but [he is] the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets\u201d (Al-Ahzab 40), and about whose message He said, \u201cVerily We revealed the Reminder and verily We shall preserve it\u201d (Al-Hijr 9).\nSeeking the Truth\nFalsehood should be rejected because it is false, just as the truth should be accepted and followed because it is true. It is not a matter of tradition, for the Lord has ordered that all nations be called to His worship.The pagan who feigns the excuse that religion is no more than family tradition should not be left to his deviance  without  receiving  proper  admonition.  No one should.\nLikewise, no nation \u2013 no matter how originally pure \u2013 is free of corruptive infiltrations. Even the nation of Muhammad g, as the years passed following his death, fell victim to various deviations in creed \u2013 some even reaching apostasy \u2013 at the hands of those who rejected  a  correct  understanding  of  faith,  of  Allah\u2019s oneness, and of the divine law in general.

He called us to the oneness of Allah, ordering us to worship Him and abandon what we and our fathers were worshiping besides Him of stones and idols, and ordered us to be truthful in speech, to render trusts [to whom they are due], to mend family ties, to be good to our neighbors, and to withhold from forbidden matters and unlawful bloodshed, and he forbade upon us fornication, false speech, devouring an orphan\u2019s wealth, and accusing chaste women of fornication. He commanded us to worship Allah alone and not make any partners  for  Him  in  worship  and  ordered  us  with prayer,  zakah  (charity),  and  fasting.  So  we  affirmed his truthfulness and believed in him, and we followed him in what he had brought us of Allah\u2019s religion.\u201d\u201cWe worshiped Allah alone, not making any partners for Him, prohibited what he forbade upon us, and  allowed  what  he  permitted  for  us,  so  our  people became hostile towards us. They tortured us and sought  to  turn  us  away  from  our  religion  through enticement and oppression in order to take us back to worshiping idols instead of Allah the Exalted, and to permitting the wicked things we used to permit. Thus, when they subjugated us, oppressed us, made things difficult for us, and stood between us and our religion, we left for your land. We chose you over others besides you, and we desired your protection and hoped that we would not be wronged in your presence, O king.\u201d\nAshamah asked him, \u201cDo you have anything of that which he has come with from Allah?\u201d Ja\u2019far replied, \u201cYes.\u201d So Ashamah said, \u201cThen read it to me.\u201d So Ja\u2019far read to him from the first section of Surat Maryam. Ashamah wept until his beard became wet and his patriarchs also wept until their books became wet when they heard what Ja\u2019far recited to them. Ashamah then said,  \u201cIndeed,  this  and  what  Jesus  came  with  have come  from  the  same  lamp.\u201d  He  then  told  the  two representatives  from  Quraysh,  \u201cGo,  for  by  Allah  I will not surrender them to you and they will not be harmed.\u201d So they left, and \u2018Amr said to \u2018Abdullah, \u201cBy Allah, tomorrow I will bring to him something from them by which I will uproot their joy.\u201d\nThe next day, \u2018Amr said to Ashamah, \u201cO king, they utter a tremendous statement concerning Jesus Son of Mary.\u201d1 So Ashamah summoned Ja\u2019far and the Muslims with him and asked them what they say about Jesus. Ja\u2019far said, \u201cWe say about him like our prophet g taught us \u2013 that he is the slave of Allah, His messenger, His [chosen] spirit, and His word which He cast into the pure virgin Mary.\u201d Ashamah then picked up a cane and said, \u201cBy Allah, Jesus Son of Mary does not exceed what you have mentioned so much as the length of this cane.\u201d His patriarchs then snorted, so he said to them, \u201cBy Allah, even if you snort!\u201d (Sirat Ibn Hisham).\nYears later, when the letter of the Prophet g reached him,  he  readily  declared  his  testimony  of  faith,  responding to the Prophet g with the following words:\u201cIn the Name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful. To Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, from Negus Ashamah: May Allah\u2019s peace be upon you, O Prophet of Allah, as well as His mercy and blessings; there is no god but Allah.\u201d\n\u201cAs for what follows: Your letter has reached me, O Messenger of Allah, including what you mentioned of the matter of Jesus. By the Lord of the heavens and the  earth,  Jesus  is  not  more  than  what  you  say.  Indeed, he is as you have stated. We have learned that with  which  you  have  been  sent  to  us,  and  we  have hosted your cousin and his companions. Thus, I bear witness, with truth and affirmation, that you are the Messenger of Allah, and I pledge allegiance to you. I have pledged allegiance to your cousin and, at his hands, have submitted to Allah, the Lord of creation\u201d (Zad  al-Ma\u2019ad).\nThus, after having been entrusted with the care and protection of the noble family and companions of the Prophet g, Ashamah\u2019s relationship with Allah\u2019s Messenger g took on a new turn. By embracing Islam, he had effectively nullified his loyalty to the disbelievers and grasped the firm handhold of Islam, making it the only scale that would define his relationship with others. This became manifest when he cut off his ties to the Byzantine emperor, Heraclius, by cancelling the tribute he used to pay to him. Ibnul-Qayyim mentions that when the Prophet g sent \u2018Amr Ibn al-\u2018As to the two kings of Oman with his letter calling them \n1  Here, \u2018Amr was referring to the fact that the Prophet g and his companions declared that Jesus was not the son of Allah as was falsely claimed by Christians after the distortion of their religion.\n\fHe c also said, \u201cSay, \u2018If there had been with Him [other] gods, as they say, then they would have sought to get closer to the Owner of the Throne.\u2019 He is glorified and greatly exalted above what they say. The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt Him. And there is not a thing except that it celebrates His praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting.  Indeed,  He  is  ever  Forbearing  and  Forgiving\u201d (Al-Isra 42-44).\nHe c also said, \u201cThen He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, \u2018Come both of you, willingly or by compulsion.\u2019 They said, \u2018We have come willingly\u2019\u201d (Fussilat 11). He c also said, \u201cHad there been within the heavens and earth gods besides Allah, they both would have been ruined. So exalted is Allah, Lord of the Throne, above what they describe\u201d (Al-Anbiya 22).\nIn these various verses, Allah c teaches His slaves that the universe He created manifests recognition of His lordship and worship of Him alone by exalting His  praise  and  prostrating  to  Him  solely.  This  submission only to Him is behind the uniformity in the creation and what it contains of laws decreed by Him. If the creation had taken a god alongside its creator, obeying Allah and obeying a false god, loving Allah and loving a false god, and fearing Allah and fearing a false god, order would collapse within the universe.Allah c also created man and instilled in him the fitrah,  a  disposition  to  recognize  His  lordship  and worship  Him  alone.  Allah  c  said,  \u201cSo  direct  your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of Allah.  That  is  the  correct  religion,  but  most  of  the people do not know\u201d (Ar-Rum 30).\nHe  c  made  this  fitrah  a  proof  against  mankind, saying, \u201cAnd [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam \u2013 from their loins \u2013 their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], \u2018Am I not your Lord?\u2019 They said, \u2018Yes, we have testified\u2019 \u2013 lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, \u2018Indeed, we were of this unaware.\u2019 Or [lest] you say, \u2018It was only that our fathers associated [others in worship] with Allah before, and we were but descendants after them. Then would You destroy us for what the falsifiers have done?\u2019\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 172173).\nSigmund Freud, one of the engineers of Western decadence\nfilthiness,  between  decency  and  obscenity,  between mercy and cruelty, between justice and tyranny, between  truth  and  falsehood,  and  between  right  and wrong. In this regards, the Prophet g  said, \u201cEvery child is born upon the fitrah. His parents then make him a Jew or a Christian, just as you breed camels. Do you see any camels with their body parts mutilated until you yourselves mutilate them?\u201d Abu Hurayrah \uf068 said, \u201cRead if you wish, \u2018\u2026the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people; no change should there be in the creation of Allah\u2026\u2019\u201d (Muslim). In this regards,  Allah  c  said,  \u201c[The  polytheists]  supplicate none but a rebellious Satan, whom Allah has cursed for he had said, \u2018I will surely take a prescribed portion from among Your servants. And I will mislead them, and I will arouse in them [sinful] desires, and I will command them so they will slit the ears of cattle, and I will command them so they will change the creation of Allah.\u2019 And whoever takes Satan as an ally instead of Allah has certainly incurred a clear loss\u201d (An-Nisa 117-119).\nThus, because the fitrah stands in the face of Satan as he attempts to deviate mankind from monotheism and purity to paganism and obscenity, he strives to obliterate this fitrah, as described by Allah c in the \nSo this fitrah is what causes man to distinguish between monotheism and polytheism.

We  covered  a  number  of different religions, including Islam. In the very first class, the teacher \u2013 who wasn\u2019t even a Muslim \u2013 recited the shahadah in Arabic and then explained to us  that  this  was  the  Islamic  testimony  of  faith. We learned about the five pillars of Islam on a very basic level, but some things were portrayed in a manner that seemed nonsensical to me. For example, we were told that during the fasting month of Ramadan, Muslims don\u2019t eat and drink all day but they stay up all night eating and partying. My next encounter with Islam was when I got married. My husband was brought up in a Muslim family but he wasn\u2019t practicing at all. We had children together but got divorced a few years afterwards. At that point, I really wanted to learn about Islam, and because of the blessed events of September 11th,  I  would  always  see  Islam  mocked  in  the  media,  but  I  was  still  curious  and  wanted  to  find  out more about this religion. At the same time, I had a neighbor who had introduced me to Islam a few years earlier. So she let me borrow a copy of the Quran that was translated into my own language. The translation wasn\u2019t so good, but she was good at explaining, so if I didn\u2019t understand anything she would clarify it for me. What struck me most as I was reading the Quran were the verses about Hellfire and the punishment in the Hereafter.\nNot long afterwards, I knew that this religion really was the truth. I started learning to pray on my own because I thought I had to learn everything before  becoming  Muslim.  I  have  to  admit  though,  I \nwas scared and nervous because I didn\u2019t understand a lot of things. I would think to myself, \u201cHow would my parents react if I were to become a Muslim? How would my colleagues react?\u201d It felt like a big ordeal even though I knew in my heart that I had to do this. So when I was coming back from work one day and I saw my neighbor on the bus, I asked her, \u201cWould you  like  to  teach  me  how  to  pray?\u201d  She  replied  by asking, \u201cDo you want to become a Muslim?\u201d At that moment, I felt myself thinking, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d So I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and both her and her husband began crying. I pronounced the shahadah in their home and they began teaching me how to pray. It was a wonderful feeling.  After  continuously  searching  for  the  truth, finding it was just such a relief. I felt so much peace.I can\u2019t say that things were easy after becoming a Muslim, but it did bring pleasure to my heart nonetheless. Things weren\u2019t easy with my parents. At first, they didn\u2019t react much, but one year later when I remarried, they began having a problem with it. When I started wearing hijab, they would make things difficult.  They  would  argue,  \u201cEven  Muslims  that  were raised Muslim don\u2019t wear it, so why do you?\u201d They were not happy, and it was funny how their Christianity came out more than ever at that point. Before that, they wouldn\u2019t speak about Christianity at all, but suddenly they were mentioning it more frequently, saying things like, \u201cThis is the religion of our forefathers.\u201d All of this was to try to bring me back to their religion. I felt the same with my colleagues, who would ask me why I had made this decision. This was the case because I was the only Muslim they would see regularly.I lived in the capital, and although there were Muslims  there,  it  wasn\u2019t  the  same  as  in  other  European countries;  the  Muslim  community  was  very  small. \n\f", "schema:headline": "Wisdom", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "34"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq10-TAWH\u012aD-AND-OUR-DUTY-TO-OUR-PARENTS", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "{And  [mention],  when  Luqm\u0101n  said  to  his  son while he was instructing him, \u201cO my son, do not associate [anything] with Allah.

Allah\u2019s  Messenger  \uf067  said  three  times, \u201cShall  I  not  inform  you  of  the  greatest  of  major sins?\u201d  The  Sah\u0101bah  replied,  \u201cYes,  O  Ras\u016blull\u0101h.\u201d He  said,  \u201cAssociating  partners  with  Allah  and wicked treatment of one\u2019s parents\u201d [Reported by alBukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim from Ab\u016b Bakrah]. He \uf067 also said, \u201cThe approval of the Lord is in the approval of one\u2019s father and the anger of the Lord is in the anger  of  one\u2019s  father\u201d  [Reported  by  at-Tirmidh\u012b from \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn \u2018Amr].\nIt  was  also  reported  by  the  T\u0101bi\u2019\u012b  Wahb  Ibn Munabbih that M\u016bs\u0101 (\u2018alayhis-sal\u0101m) asked his Lord (\u2018azza wa jall), \u201cO Lord, with what do you order me?\u201d  He  replied,  \u201cThat  you  do  not  associate  any partners with Me.\u201d He asked, \u201cAnd with what else?\u201d He replied, \u201cThat you be dutiful to your mother.\u201d He asked, \u201cAnd with what else?\u201d He replied, \u201cThat you  be  dutiful  to  your  mother.\u201d  He  asked,  \u201cAnd with what else?\u201d He replied, \u201cThat you be dutiful to your mother\u201d [Az-Zuhd \u2013 Im\u0101m Ahmad].\nSo how can the muwahhid ignore this obligation and  commit  the  major  sin  second  to  shirk  by treating  his  parents  wickedly?  And  how  can  the muwahhid not thank them, speak good words to them,  and  accompany  them  with  kindness?  This kind treatment is obligatory even if they might be sinful, and even if they order him with sin!\nBut  the  muwahhid  should  always  remember  that he is obliged not to obey his parents in what entails disobedience of Allah \uf063 as ordered by these \u0101y\u0101t and as the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cThere is no obedience to anyone in disobedience of Allah. Obedience is only in good\u201d [Reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim from \u2018Al\u012b]. He \uf067 also said, \u201cUpon the Muslim is to listen and obey in regards to what he likes and dislikes,  except  if  he  is  ordered  with  sin.  If  he  is ordered  with  sin,  then  there  is  no  listening  nor obedience  [in  sin]\u201d  [Reported  by  al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b  and Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar].\nAmongst  the  major  sins  that  many  parents  order their  children  with  is  the  abandonment  of  the fard  \u2018ayn  jih\u0101d  (jih\u0101d  which  is  obligatory  upon each  and  every  individual).  They  intentionally  or unintentionally  distort  the  meaning  of  various ah\u0101d\u012bth on the obligation to obtain the permission of  one\u2019s  Muslim  parents  before  performing  fard kif\u0101yah jih\u0101d (jih\u0101d which is an obligation on the Ummah as a whole but not obligatory upon each and  every  individual).  These  ah\u0101d\u012bth  should  be understood  in  light  of  other  evidences  including the  statement  of  Allah  \uf063,  {Say,  \u201cIf  your  fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth  which  you  have  obtained,  commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and  His  Messenger  and  jih\u0101d  in  His  cause,  then wait until Allah executes His command. And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people\u201d} [At-Tawbah: 24]. This \u0101yah refers to a jih\u0101d that is not excused by obeying one\u2019s parents. The scholars have unanimously explained that such jih\u0101d is the fard \u2018ayn jih\u0101d.\nIbn  Qud\u0101mah  said,  \u201cIf  jih\u0101d  becomes  obligatory upon  him  then  the  permission  of  his  parents  is not taken into consideration because the jih\u0101d has become fard \u2018ayn and abandonment of it is a sin. There  is  no  obedience  to  anyone  in  disobedience of  Allah.  Similarly  is  the  case  of  hajj,  jam\u0101\u2019ah prayer, Friday prayer, travel for seeking obligatory knowledge. Al-Awz\u0101\u2019\u012b said, \u2018There is no obedience to  the  parents  in  abandonment  of  obligations, Friday prayer, hajj, and jih\u0101d, because they are acts of worship that became obligatory upon him as an \ndabiq\n\fwho  fulfills  its  conditions  and  qualification mentioned  in  the  texts  of  the  Shar\u012b\u2019ah  and  the words of the scholars. The im\u0101m could be general to  all  the  Muslims,  and  he  is  called  the  general im\u0101m  or  the  khal\u012bfah.  This  leader,  due  to  his status and the nature of his im\u0101mah, has general influence; obedience to him is obligatory upon all the Muslims. This kind of im\u0101mah is the default by which the obligation upon the whole Ummah to appoint a khal\u012bfah is fulfilled and through him, the obligation is established. This is the intent of all  the  verses  and  ah\u0101d\u012bth  that  order  and  guide towards  appointing  an  im\u0101m  and  khal\u012bfah,  like the  hadith,  \u201cThen  there  will  be  khil\u0101fah  upon the  prophetic  methodology,\u201d  and  the  had\u012bth narrated by Hudhayfah \uf068 \u201cStick to the jam\u0101\u2019ah of the Muslims and their im\u0101m,\u201d and the hadith \u201cIf bay\u2019ah is given to two khulaf\u0101\u2019, then kill the second of the two,\u201d and the other texts that are about  the  rules  regarding  the  general  im\u0101m  or khal\u012bfah  who  deserves  this  description  having fulfilled the conditions and qualifications for it, as in the case of the khil\u0101fah of the four Rightly Guided Khulaf\u0101\u2019, as well as al-Hasan Ibn \u2018Al\u012b Ibn Ab\u012b T\u0101lib, Mu\u2019\u0101wiyah Ibn Ab\u012b Sufy\u0101n, \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn az-Zubayr \uf06a and the khilafah of \u2018Umar Ibn \u2018Abdil-\u2018Az\u012bz r, and others [from the Umaw\u012b and \u2018Abb\u0101s\u012b khulaf\u0101\u2019].\nAnd it might be the case that the im\u0101m or am\u012br is specific to some region or land, then he would be  a  territorial  leader  whose  authority  does  not exceed his territory, as the historians mentioned that  when  the  khal\u012bfah  of  the  time  Mu\u2019\u0101wiyah Ibn Yaz\u012bd died in 64AH, the people of Damascus appointed ad-Dahh\u0101k Ibn Qays as a leader to look after their affairs until the general im\u0101m is given bay\u2019ah.  This  kind  of  leadership  is  not  allowed except in cases of necessity and when the general im\u0101mah  is  dissolved.  This  is  done  to  fill  the political and shar\u2019\u012b gap and to establish whatever is  possible  from  the  laws  of  the  Shar\u012b\u2019ah.  Many scholars  of  shar\u2019\u012b  governance  have  mentioned such  appointments  in  such  situations,  like  alJuwayn\u012b  in  his  prized  book  \u201cGiy\u0101th  al-Umam,\u201d in which he said, \u201cThe purpose of im\u0101mah is the betterment of the condition of the general public, planning the affairs, and protecting the frontiers.\u201d\n\u201cTherefore,  if  appointing  a  single  im\u0101m  whose orders  are  executed  is  possible,  then  there  is  no doubt  that  this  is  best  in  accordance  with  the requisites  of  governance.  If  this  is  not  possible, it is not correct to leave and neglect the people whom the im\u0101m\u2019s supervision does not reach, as there  will  be  no  leader  to  gather  them  nor  any deterrent  to  prevent  them  from  evil.  So  they have to appoint ministers to whom they turn for leadership.  If  they  remain  leaderless,  they  will perish, and this is obvious and unpreventable.\u201d\nIf not for the absence of the Khil\u0101fah before, there would  not  have  been  a  shar\u2019\u012b  justification  for those territorial leaderships or small groups to be formed and remain. Accordingly, it is obligatory to  appoint  a  single  im\u0101m  and  khal\u012bfah  for  the Ummah who will govern the people in accordance with  Allah\u2019s  religion  and  make  them  follow  the laws  of  the  Shar\u012b\u2019ah.  This  is  because  khil\u0101fah  is similar to the case of water for wud\u016b\u2019, which is the  default,  and  those  territorial  leaderships  are like tayammum, which is an alternative allowed when necessary. And when the default is available, the  alternative  is  unaccepted.  Therefore,  when the  khal\u012bfah  is  appointed,  all  other  pledges  of allegiance  and  leaderships  outside  of  it  become void. That is why al-Juwayn\u012b said after his above statement, \u201cIf the obstacles are removed and the im\u0101m is able to supervise those people, the leader and his subjects must obey the im\u0101m and submit to  him  in  peace.  The  im\u0101m  should  accept  their excuses  and  govern  their  affairs.  If  he  decides to  approve  the  appointment  of  whom  they  had appointed, he can do so. And if he sees it best to change  him,  then  his  opinion  is  to  be  followed and they must return to his decision.\u201d\nIf this is understood and the difference between these  realities  becomes  obvious,  the  answer  to the  question  posed  becomes  clear  through  the just  and  precise  description  of  the  im\u0101mah  of Shaykh  Ab\u016b  Bakr  al-Husayn\u012b  al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b  and the leadership of Mull\u0101 \u2018Umar, since one cannot decide  on  a  matter  until  the  whole  picture  is understood.  Accordingly, the  declarations, statements,  conducts,  and  nature  of  Mull\u0101 \u2018Umar\u2019s leadership shows without a doubt that it \ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "TAWH\u012aD AND OUR DUTY TO OUR PARENTS", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "14"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq15-Why-We-Hate-You-&-Why-We-Fight-You", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "15", "schema:articleBody": "Christian disbelief and paganism\nthat the masses deem to be \u201cpolitically incorrect.\u201d The apostate \u201cimams\u201d in the West will adhere to the same tired clich\u00e9 in order to avoid a backlash from the disbelieving societies in which they\u2019ve chosen to reside. The point is, people know that it\u2019s foolish, but they keep repeating it regardless because they\u2019re afraid of the consequences of deviating from the script.\nThere  are  exceptions  among  the  disbelievers,  no doubt, people who will unabashedly declare that jihad and the laws of the Shari\u2019ah \u2013 as well as everything else deemed taboo by the Islam-is-a-peaceful-religion crowd \u2013 are in fact completely Islamic, but they tend to be people with far less credibility who are painted as a social fringe, so their voices are dismissed and a large segment of the ignorant masses continues believing the false narrative. As such, it becomes important for us to clarify to the West in unequivocal terms \u2013 yet again \u2013 why we hate you and why we fight you.\n1.  We hate you, first and foremost, because you are  disbelievers;  you  reject  the  oneness  of  Allah  \u2013 whether  you  realize  it  or  not  \u2013  by  making  partners for  Him  in  worship,  you  blaspheme  against  Him, claiming that He has a son, you fabricate lies against His prophets and messengers, and you indulge in all manner of devilish practices. It is for this reason that we were commanded to openly declare our hatred for you and our enmity towards you. \u201cThere has already been for you an excellent example in Abraham and \nthose with him, when they said to their people, \u2018Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than Allah. We have rejected you, and there has arisen, between us and you, enmity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone\u2019\u201d (Al-Mumtahanah 4). Furthermore, just as your disbelief  is  the  primary  reason  we  hate  you,  your  disbelief is the primary reason we fight you, as we have been commanded to fight the disbelievers until they submit to the authority of Islam, either by becoming Muslims, or by paying jizyah \u2013 for those afforded this option \u2013 and living in humiliation under the rule of the Muslims. Thus, even if you were to stop fighting us, your best-case scenario in a state of war would be that we would suspend our attacks against you \u2013 if we deemed it necessary \u2013 in order to focus on the closer and more immediate threats, before eventually resuming our campaigns against you. Apart from the option of a temporary truce, this is the only likely scenario that would bring you fleeting respite from our attacks. So in the end, you cannot bring an indefinite halt to our war against you. At most, you could only delay it temporarily. \u201cAnd fight them until there is no fitnah [paganism] and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah\u201d (Al-Baqarah 193).\n2.

He \uf067 also said, \u201cThe approval of the Lord is in the approval of one\u2019s father and the anger of the Lord is in the anger  of  one\u2019s  father\u201d  [Reported  by  at-Tirmidh\u012b from \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn \u2018Amr].\nIt  was  also  reported  by  the  T\u0101bi\u2019\u012b  Wahb  Ibn Munabbih that M\u016bs\u0101 (\u2018alayhis-sal\u0101m) asked his Lord (\u2018azza wa jall), \u201cO Lord, with what do you order me?\u201d  He  replied,  \u201cThat  you  do  not  associate  any partners with Me.\u201d He asked, \u201cAnd with what else?\u201d He replied, \u201cThat you be dutiful to your mother.\u201d He asked, \u201cAnd with what else?\u201d He replied, \u201cThat you  be  dutiful  to  your  mother.\u201d  He  asked,  \u201cAnd with what else?\u201d He replied, \u201cThat you be dutiful to your mother\u201d [Az-Zuhd \u2013 Im\u0101m Ahmad].\nSo how can the muwahhid ignore this obligation and  commit  the  major  sin  second  to  shirk  by treating  his  parents  wickedly?  And  how  can  the muwahhid not thank them, speak good words to them,  and  accompany  them  with  kindness?  This kind treatment is obligatory even if they might be sinful, and even if they order him with sin!\nBut  the  muwahhid  should  always  remember  that he is obliged not to obey his parents in what entails disobedience of Allah \uf063 as ordered by these \u0101y\u0101t and as the Prophet \uf067 said, \u201cThere is no obedience to anyone in disobedience of Allah. Obedience is only in good\u201d [Reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim from \u2018Al\u012b]. He \uf067 also said, \u201cUpon the Muslim is to listen and obey in regards to what he likes and dislikes,  except  if  he  is  ordered  with  sin.  If  he  is ordered  with  sin,  then  there  is  no  listening  nor obedience  [in  sin]\u201d  [Reported  by  al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b  and Muslim from Ibn \u2018Umar].\nAmongst  the  major  sins  that  many  parents  order their  children  with  is  the  abandonment  of  the fard  \u2018ayn  jih\u0101d  (jih\u0101d  which  is  obligatory  upon each  and  every  individual).  They  intentionally  or unintentionally  distort  the  meaning  of  various ah\u0101d\u012bth on the obligation to obtain the permission of  one\u2019s  Muslim  parents  before  performing  fard kif\u0101yah jih\u0101d (jih\u0101d which is an obligation on the Ummah as a whole but not obligatory upon each and  every  individual).  These  ah\u0101d\u012bth  should  be understood  in  light  of  other  evidences  including the  statement  of  Allah  \uf063,  {Say,  \u201cIf  your  fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth  which  you  have  obtained,  commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and  His  Messenger  and  jih\u0101d  in  His  cause,  then wait until Allah executes His command. And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people\u201d} [At-Tawbah: 24]. This \u0101yah refers to a jih\u0101d that is not excused by obeying one\u2019s parents. The scholars have unanimously explained that such jih\u0101d is the fard \u2018ayn jih\u0101d.\nIbn  Qud\u0101mah  said,  \u201cIf  jih\u0101d  becomes  obligatory upon  him  then  the  permission  of  his  parents  is not taken into consideration because the jih\u0101d has become fard \u2018ayn and abandonment of it is a sin. There  is  no  obedience  to  anyone  in  disobedience of  Allah.  Similarly  is  the  case  of  hajj,  jam\u0101\u2019ah prayer, Friday prayer, travel for seeking obligatory knowledge. Al-Awz\u0101\u2019\u012b said, \u2018There is no obedience to  the  parents  in  abandonment  of  obligations, Friday prayer, hajj, and jih\u0101d, because they are acts of worship that became obligatory upon him as an \ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "THE ALLIES OF AL-Q\u0100\u2019IDAH IN SH\u0100M: PART III", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "6"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq8-PARADIGM-SHIFT---JOHN-CANTLIE", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "Dempsey,  chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff, confessed  on  television  that  \u201cfirstly,  there\u2019s  no military-only solution to ISIL.

But  today  the men in charge are being forced to concede that maybe, just perhaps, they were a little too quick off the mark to dismiss the Islamic State as merely \u201ca terrorist organization, pure and simple.\u201d And that\u2019s just three months into their campaign.\nI  am  certainly  no  expert  on  such  matters  and my  views  are  those  of  a  layman,  but  generally one doesn\u2019t expect a mere \u201corganization\u201d to lay siege  to  cities  or  have  their  own  police  force. You certainly don\u2019t expect a mere \u201corganization\u201d to  have  tanks  and  artillery  pieces,  an  army  of soldiers tens of thousands strong, and their own spy drones. And one certainly doesn\u2019t expect a mere \u201corganization\u201d to have a mint with plans to \nPARADIGM SHIFT\nproduce their own currency, primary schools for the young, and a functioning court system.\nThese, surely, are all hallmarks of (whisper it if you dare) a country.\nAh,  the  C-word.  It\u2019s  being  used  sporadically  by the media, slowly at first but its use is gathering pace.

Countries can be born in days, in hours during a coup, or in minutes at the signing of a paper, they have been for centuries. So there\u2019s no reason this one shouldn\u2019t have been born the way it was. And if it\u2019s not the Islamic State\u2019s country, then just whose is it?\nCertainly, it no longer belongs to Bashar al-Asad, holed up in Damascus as his soldiers recuperate after  four  years  of  massacring  the  Muslims  of Syria.  There  was  never  any  legitimacy  to  his tyrannical rule and what control he had has long passed and can never return.\nDoes  it  then  belong  to  the  newly  instated  and incompetent  puppet  Iraqi  government,  tucked away in Baghdad while its army licks its wounds from the murderous thrashing it received from the muj\u0101hid\u012bn back in the summer? Clearly not. And it definitely doesn\u2019t belong to the Free Syrian Army, who had years to do something decisive or cohesive but chose instead to smoke Gauloises cigarettes, drink tea, and complain that nothing could be done without NATO jets flying overhead.

However, the ultimate message of the Prophet Muhammad g, the revelation he was dispatched with \u2013 the Quran and the Sunnah \u2013 and the message of all past prophets from Adam to Muhammad \uf070 has been the same throughout history: There is no ilah but Allah. The ilah linguistically being \u201cwhat deserves worship,\u201d i.e. nothing and  no  one  deserves  worship  except  Allah.  Allah  is the proper name of the Lord and the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth. It is derived from the same word ilah and is similar in root to the name of the Creator as found in all Semitic languages, including the Hebrew spoken by the Prophets of the Children of Israel. In the Hebrew tongue, they would supplicate the Lord saying \u201cElohim,\u201d which corresponds in Arabic  to  \u201cAllahumm;\u201d  the  suffix  \u201chim\u201d  of  Hebrew and \u201chumm\u201d of Arabic \u2013 sometimes referred to as the \u201cmajestic plural\u201d \u2013 affixed to \u201cEloh\u201d and \u201cAllah\u201d is to emphasize His reverence and the supplicant\u2019s humility. He is to be worshiped alone as He alone is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, He alone is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and He alone has the  loftiest  attributes,  including  knowledge,  power, justice,  mercy,  wisdom,  beauty,  honor,  majesty,  etc. If some of His creation manifests praiseworthy traits, then this is only due to His design and His guidance; the traits of the creation can never be on par with His perfect  attributes.  This  is  why  He  deserves  worship alone and why no person or object can ever deserve worship.\nAs  for  believing  that  there  are  other  \u201cgods\u201d  who partook in the creation of the universe or who have share in its lordship, then this was a creed so deviant \nto submit to Allah sincerely (i.e. to Him alone).\nand  contrary  to  the  fitrah  that  not  even  the  pre-Islamic  pagan  Arabs  believed  in  such.  Instead,  their paganism was in supplicating idols representing the righteous; they would do so seeking the intercession of the righteous on their behalf before Allah c. However, at times of severe calamity, they would abandon their idols and supplicate Allah alone. Allah c said, \u201cAnd when they board a ship, they supplicate Allah, being sincere to Him in religion. But when He delivers them to the land, they immediately give shares of worship to other than Him\u201d (Al-\u2018Ankabut 65). Accordingly, this part of the fitrah \u2013 recognition of Allah\u2019s lordship alone \u2013 was emphasized by all the prophets in their mission to bring back their pagan peoples to the abandoned part of the fitrah \u2013 worship of Allah alone. Allah c said, \u201cAnd if you asked them, \u2018Who created the heavens and the earth?\u2019 they would surely say, \u2018Allah.\u2019 Say, \u2018Then have you considered what you supplicate besides Allah? If Allah intended me harm, are they removers of His harm; or if He intended me mercy, are they withholders of His mercy?\u2019 Say, \u2018Sufficient for me is Allah; in Him the trusting put their trust\u2019\u201d (Az-Zumar 38). He c also said, \u201cSay, \u2018Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges [every] matter?\u2019 They will say, \u2018Allah.\u2019 So say, \u2018Then will you not fear Him?\u2019\u201d (Yunus 31), meaning, will you not fear Him by worshiping Him alone and obeying Him only?\nAllah c also said, \u201cAnd We sent not before you any messenger except that We revealed to him that, \u2018There is no god except Me, so worship Me\u2019\u201d (Al-Anbiya 25). Thus, the message of all the prophets emphasizes worship and obedience of Allah only and no one  else.  There  is  no  ilah  but  Allah,  meaning  none \n\fcreatures and facilitated for them a means of communication not fathomable by either of them!\nIt was a moment of reflection like no other, a blessing from Allah c. After my shift was over, I rushed to speak about it with another murabit, Abul-Muthanna as-Sumali2  \uf08a.  For  several  months  together,  we  had both been in the ranks of the Islamic State, then operating in the Levant under the name \u201cJabhat an-Nusrah.\u201d I told him about the experience with the cat and he smiled, appreciating Allah\u2019s signs in His creation. \n2  Abul-Muthanna  as-Sumali  (Ali  Dirie)  was  a  man  of  great character and worship. After being imprisoned by the Crusaders for seven years, he was able to flee Canada despite being banned from  travel.  He  planned,  strove,  and  relied upon Allah alone, until he arrived in the Levant. When I first met him, he would regularly read from the same mushaf that had accompanied him in his Canadian prison cell. Upon the official expansion of the Islamic State to the Levant, he rushed to revive the Muslim Jama\u2019ah through his bay\u2019ah. He was not affected by the doubts of the jihad claimants and remained firm upon his covenant. Several weeks later, he had a dream in which the Hur (the maidens of Paradise) gave him glad tidings of martyrdom on a specific date (one which I have forgotten). A week before his martyrdom, several of our friends decided to go shopping for new military attire. He told them he wouldn\u2019t be going with them, because he was expecting martyrdom soon, and narrated to them his dream. When that day arrived, it happened that all Islamic State soldiers were placed on alert due to sudden advances of the Nusayri army and their Rafidi allies on the frontlines near Kafar Hamrah (in the  northern  Aleppo  countryside).  Abul-Muthanna  rushed  to battle and advanced in the direction of the enemy, fighting, until he was severely wounded, bleeding until he surrendered his soul to his Lord. Due to the intensity of enemy fire, it was not possible to extract his body from the forward position he had reached. May Allah accept him and add the blessing of caliphate we enjoy today to the scroll of his good deeds and that of all other martyrs.\nThe conversation led us to reflect more upon others of Allah\u2019s signs, even expressing our good assumptions on the revival of the caliphate with the continuation of jihad in the Levant, by Allah\u2019s permission. Abul-Muthanna later went on his ribat shift, observing the same cat and looking out for any potential Nusayri soldiers.I  don\u2019t  remember  now  if  it  was  then  or  sometime shortly before, when I had sat at our base near Aleppo and penned a list of different signs in Allah\u2019s creation to contemplate while on ribat. I later asked Abul-Muthanna if he\u2019d like me to share the list with him. He was very encouraging. So I read to him different  items  on  it  and  he  would  comment  on  how they were undoubtedly from Allah\u2019s many signs manifesting His wisdom, knowledge, greatness, power, and mercy, as well as His constant support for Islam and the Muslims. It was an invigorating conversation of faith, one which was difficult to hold in the West, as the  Muslim  would  find  himself  a  stranger  amongst the herds who had been westernized by the Murtadd Brotherhood.\nHere, I\u2019ll mention briefly some of the signs we had discussed. But before doing so, let me present an example for the atheists and agnostics of the West who will probably read these words, those odd disbelievers who  arrogantly  deny  Allah  and  haughtily  resist  the testimony  of  their  very  own  fitrah  (natural  human disposition), which Allah instilled in them. Allah c said, \u201cAnd it is He who begins creation; then He repeats it, and that would be easier for Him. His is the sublime example in the heavens and earth. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise\u201d (Ar-Rum 27-28).

This is a very important and very serious matter, which the Wise legislator has urged. And His Messenger g has made disobedience of one\u2019s leader similar to disobedience of the Prophet g. Listening and obeying is from unity, cooperation, and strength,  in  contrast  with  quarrelling,  disunity,  and  disagreement.\nQuarrelling  and  disagreement  in  jih\u0101d  is  considered  a means of failure and defeat. {And do not dispute and [thus] lose courage and [then] your strength would depart; and be patient.

She told me that she claimed we were all doing well \u2013 and in the Duny\u0101 sense we were in fact doing fairly well \u2013 when in reality, as my mother said, \u201cEvery family that comes here suffers one calamity or another with respect to their children.\u201d What she was referring to, as she went on to clarify, were the countless Muslim youth in the West who get themselves tangled into drugs, alcohol, gangs, promiscuity, and other vices and social illnesses over which any decent Muslim family would weep for its children.\nAnd  yet  as  terrible  as  these  vices  may  be,  the  fact  remains that many still downplay the severity of kufr in comparison with other sins. This is not to water down the issue of committing sins but for the sake of perspective I need to make it clear that this is addressed to Muslims who are risking their entire Hereafter by continuing to live under the authority of the crusaders waging war against Islam or in lands ruled by \n3333\nO YOU WHO HAVE BELIEVED, PROTECT YOURSELVES AND YOUR FAMILIES FROM FIRE\n\f3737\nTHE REVIVAL OF JIH\u0100D IN BENGAL\n\f", "schema:headline": "O YOU WHO HAVE BELIEVED, PROTECT YOURSELVES AND YOUR FAMILIES FROM FIRE", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "33"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq10-AMONG-THE-BELIEVERS-ARE-MEN", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "On  the  29th  of  Sha\u2019b\u0101n  in  the  year 1436AH,  after  a  crusader  airstrike, a  warrior  from  the  warriors  of  the Khil\u0101fah  travelled  from  this  fading Duny\u0101  to  that  which  is  everlasting. The  brother  T\u0101riq  Ibn  at-T\u0101hir  alHarz\u012b  \u2013  otherwise  known  as  Ab\u016b \u2018Umar  at-Tunus\u012b  \u2013  was  killed  in Wil\u0101yat al-Barakah, completing a life of  jih\u0101d  and  many  years  of  service working  to  help  build  the  Islamic State  and  reestablish  the  Khil\u0101fah. He had, throughout his jih\u0101d in both Ir\u0101q and Sh\u0101m, a number of different titles and held a number of different positions.\nA veteran of many years in the Islamic State, the brother first made hijrah to Iraq in 2003. He became acquainted with some of the legends of the Iraqi jih\u0101d such as Ab\u016b Mus\u2019ab az-Zarq\u0101w\u012b and  Ab\u016b  Hamzah  al-Muh\u0101jir  (may Allah accept them both). The former, as  the  jih\u0101d  progressed,  made  a request for the brother to come to alFall\u016bjah. It was a call to which Ab\u016b \u2018Umar  responded,  living  great  days in the city that stood defiantly in the \nface  of  the  American  transgression on  the  lands  of  the  Muslims. Time passed,  many  kuff\u0101r  were  sent  to Jahannam,  and  the  brother  was  hit by  a  crusader  airstrike  in  which  all those who were with him were killed. This time Allah \uf062 saved him and he emerged  relatively  unharmed.  He was  later  hit  by  a  second  airstrike, resulting in his leg being severed (he later  became  well  known  for  this physical attribute).\nThe  brother  was  imprisoned  twice in Iraq, the first time escaping with a fake document under the pretense that he was Iraqi and not a muh\u0101jir. The  Americans  were  enraged  upon discovering  the  true  identity  of  the man who had slipped through their inept  fingers.  The  second  time  was in 2008 after he was sentenced to 15 years. He and a group of his muj\u0101hid brothers escaped during an operation by  the  Islamic  State  to  liberate  the T\u0101j\u012b  prison.  He  was  subsequently sent  to  land  of  Sh\u0101m  and  was made  responsible  for  receiving  the istishh\u0101diyy\u012bn  and  appointed  the \nam\u012br of the Atmah gateway. He was a brave leader during the war against the sahwah treachery and was famous for his saying, \u201cAllah will never grant them  victory  over  us.  We  defeated them in Iraq, and we will also defeat them  in  Sh\u0101m,  by  Allah\u2019s  bounty alone.\u201d\nAb\u016b \u2018Umar was known for practicing zuhd with respect to his clothes and his food, earning the love and respect of  many  after  reaching  the  blessed land  of  Sh\u0101m.  After  relocating, he  settled  in  Wil\u0101yat  al-Barakah, eventually  being  appointed  as  the am\u012br  of  the  wil\u0101yah\u2019s  artillery.  This beloved  brother  and  veteran  was killed  24  hours  after  his  brother Abuz-Zubayr \u2018Al\u012b al-Harz\u012b was killed in  Mosul.  The  two  brothers,  both avid  boxers,  together  terrorized  the kuff\u0101r, leaving this world in the same way as each other.\nHe  was  a  thorn  in  the  sides  of  the disbelieving  crusaders  and  their  slaves from  amongst  the  apostates.  We  ask Allah to accept him in al-Firdaws al-A\u2019l\u0101.\ndabiq\n\fguidance to the wives of the Sahwah soldiers, in order for me {to be absolved before your Lord and perhaps they may fear Him} [Al-A\u2019r\u0101f: 164].\nWe write this for the wives of the secular-oriented Sahw\u0101t  who  have  stated  explicitly  or  implicitly their intent to rule with democracy, or according to what the people desire, or with division of powers. Allah \uf063 said, {And He shares not His legislation with anyone} [Al-Kahf: 26].\nWe also write this for the wives of the Sahw\u0101t who superficially claim Islam and stuck out their necks for their secular-oriented brothers and supported them with their lives and with everything precious to them against the muwahidd\u012bn. \nAllah  \uf063  says,  {And  whoever  is  an  ally  to  them among  you  \u2013  then  indeed,  he  is  [one]  of  them} [Al-M\u0101\u2019idah: 51].\nFrom amongst the most beautiful stories found in the  books  of  history  is  the  story  of  Zaynab,  the daughter  of  the  Prophet  \uf067,  and  her  husband Abul-\u2018\u0100s Ibn ar-Rab\u012b\u2019, who were united by love and marriage, and split apart by kufr and shirk. Abul\u2018\u0100s married Zaynab, who was the daughter of his maternal aunt Khad\u012bjah \uf069. When the revelation descended upon the Prophet \uf067, Khad\u012bjah and her daughters believed in him and followed his religion, and this included Zaynab. Her husband Abul-\u2018\u0100s, however,  rejected  Islam  and  remained  upon  his shirk.  At  that  time,  Islam  had  divided  between every married couple where one of them followed other than Islam. Abul-\u2018\u0100s, however, held his wife with him in Makkah. Then, Allah \uf063 willed that he would fall prisoner to the Muslims in the battle of  Badr.  The  people  of  Makkah  sent  ransoms  to the Prophet \uf067. Here, the Mother of the Believers \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah Bint as-Sidd\u012bq \uf069 will continue the story for us. She said, \u201cWhen the people of Makkah sent ransoms for their imprisoned relatives, Zaynab the daughter of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 sent some wealth as a ransom for Abul-\u2018\u0100s Ibn ar-Rab\u012b\u2019. She sent a necklace which Khad\u012bjah had her wear when she sent  her  to  Abul-\u2018\u0100s  to  move  in  with  him  after marriage.\u201d \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah said, \u201cWhen Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 saw it, he felt much pity for her. He said, \u2018If \nyou would like to free her prisoner and return her wealth to her then do so.\u2019 They said, \u2018Yes, O Allah\u2019s Messenger.\u2019 So they freed him and returned to her what  was  hers\u201d  [Reported  by  Im\u0101m  Ahmad  and Ab\u016b D\u0101w\u016bd].\nAnd  it\u2019s  reported  that  the  Prophet  \uf067  stipulated on  him  that  he  return  Zaynab  when  he  reaches Makkah because she was no longer lawful for him as long as he remained a mushrik. Abul-\u2018\u0100s did so, and  Zaynab  \uf069  left  for  al-Mad\u012bnah,  the  land  of Islam. Zaynab left Makkah out of love for Allah and in submission to His command, and did not put her husband and his companionship above the decree of Allah and His Messenger \uf067, because {it is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when  Allah  and  His  Messenger  have  decided  a matter,  that  they  should  have  any  choice  about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger  has  certainly  strayed  into  clear  error} [Al-Ahz\u0101b: 36].\nHowever, Allah wished to open Abul-\u2018\u0100s\u2019s heart to the truth many long years after his wife\u2019s hijrah, so he came to the Prophet \uf067 declaring his Islam, and so the Prophet returned Zaynab to him.\nThen  there\u2019s  Umm  Sulaym  Bint  Milh\u0101n  likewise refusing  to  marry  a  k\u0101fir  and  stipulating  that  he embraces Islam as her mahr (dowry). It was reported on the authority of Anas \uf068 who said, \u201cAb\u016b Talhah proposed to Umm Sulaym, so she said, \u2018By Allah, one  such  as  yourself  cannot  be  rejected,  O  Ab\u016b Talhah, but you are a k\u0101fir man and I am a Muslim woman, and it is not permissible for me to marry you. So if you embrace Islam, then that will be my mahr, and I will not ask from you other than that.\u2019 So  he  embraced  Islam  and  that  was  her  mahr\u201d [Reported by an-Nas\u0101\u2019\u012b and Ibn Hibb\u0101n].\nSo then that is Islam. It declares it loudly, clearly, and  explicitly:  {They  are  not  lawful  [wives]  for them,  nor  are  they  lawful  [husbands]  for  them} [Al-Mumtahanah: 10]. So there is no Islam with kufr,  no  tawhid  with  shirk,  and  no  \u012bm\u0101n  with nif\u0101q. And this small Muslim home is the core of the Ummah, and the parable of these two spouses and  their  children  is  like  that  of  a  plant  that \ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "AMONG THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "40"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq9-THE-ALLIES-OF-AL-Q\u0100\u2019IDAH-IN-SH\u0100M:-PART-II", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "9", "schema:articleBody": "evil,  and  corruption  that  rushed  madly  to  the blessed  land  of  Yemen  and  dared  encroaching upon  the  soil  of  the  Noble  Haramayn  in  the interest of a foreign, spiteful, divisive, Safaw\u012b plan.

This is a matter that we will never allow to happen, whatever the circumstances may be.

Allah  (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101)  said,  {Those  who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve  fight  in  the  cause  of  t\u0101gh\u016bt.  So  fight against  the  allies  of  Shayt\u0101n}  [An-Nis\u0101\u2019:  76]. So  it  is  not  permissible  for  the  Muslim  to  fight against \u0100l Sal\u016bl under the leadership of the R\u0101fid\u012b Houthis nor is it permissible to fight against the R\u0101fid\u012b Houthis under the leadership of \u0100l Sal\u016bl. If he does fight under the leadership of the t\u0101gh\u016bt in defense of his kufr\u012b regime, he apostatizes from Islam.  Therefore,  the  Muslim  should  know  that the obligation upon him when the apostates wage war  against  each  other  is  to  declare  his  bar\u0101\u2019ah from  both  apostate  parties  and  \u2013  if  he  is  able  \u2013 to perform jih\u0101d against both of them for Allah\u2019s sake.\nAs  to  the  cause  behind  this  deviant  declaration being  released,  then  it  is  the  addiction  of  these factions  to  t\u0101gh\u016bt  aid.  Initially,  the  taw\u0101gh\u012bt trap  them  with  supposedly  \u201cinnocent\u201d  and \u201cunconditional\u201d  aid  before  they  slide  down  a slippery slope of concessions ending with blatant apostasy.\nAnd  so,  will  the  jih\u0101d  claimants  of  the  Jawl\u0101n\u012b front  wage  \u201cjih\u0101d\u201d  against  their  allies,  the shameless slaves of \u0100l Sal\u016bl? Or are there endless excuses  prepared  for  each  blatant  statement  of apostasy made by them? \u0100l Sal\u016bl have now openly occupied  parts  of  Idlib,  Halab,  and  Sh\u0101m  in general through this \u201clegion,\u201d Zahr\u0101n \u2018All\u016bsh, and their  brothers  from  the  \u201cIslamic\u201d  Front.

He ordered them to outlast the kuff\u0101r in patience and to perform rib\u0101t against the mushrik\u012bn\u201d [Tafs\u012br at-Tabar\u012b].\nZayd Ibn Aslam (rahimahull\u0101h) said, \u201cBe patient upon jih\u0101d, outlast your enemy in patience, and perform  rib\u0101t  against  your  enemy\u201d  [Tafs\u012br  atTabar\u012b].\nQat\u0101dah  (rahimahull\u0101h)  said,  \u201cThat  means, be  patient  upon  obedience  to  Allah,  outlast  in patience the people of deviance, perform rib\u0101t for the cause of Allah, {and fear Allah that you may be successful}\u201d [Tafs\u012br at-Tabar\u012b].\nMuhammad Ibn Ka\u2019b al-Quradh\u012b (rahimahull\u0101h) said, \u201c{And perform rib\u0101t} against My enemy and your  enemy  until  he  abandons  his  religion  for your religion\u201d [Tafs\u012br Ibn al-Mundhir].\nThe \u0101yah is a command to perform the well-known rib\u0101t  for  Allah\u2019s  cause  at  the  frontier  posts,  as  it was interpreted by \u2018Umar and Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s from the Sah\u0101bah (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anhum) and by al-Hasan alBasr\u012b, Qat\u0101dah, Zayd Ibn Aslam, and Muhammad Ibn Ka\u2019b from the T\u0101bi\u2019\u012bn (rahimahumull\u0101h).\nAs for the hadith reported by Muslim from Ab\u016b Hurayrah (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anh) in which Ras\u016blull\u0101h (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  said,  \u201cShall  I  not tell you that by which Allah erases your misdeeds and raises your ranks? Completing wud\u016b\u2019 despite hardships (cold weather and minor wounds), taking many steps towards the mas\u0101jid (for prayer), and waiting for the next prayer after the prayer ends. Indeed,  this  (waiting)  is  rib\u0101t,\u201d  then  the  hadith is similar to those ah\u0101d\u012bth describing jih\u0101d to be exerting oneself in obedience to Allah, hijrah to be abandoning what Allah dislikes, and Islam to be good words and feeding the poor2. It doesn\u2019t limit the meaning of rib\u0101t to waiting for prayer nor does its wording indicate that it\u2019s a commentary on the \u0101yah.  For  this  reason,  at-Tabar\u012b  (rahimahull\u0101h) 2 See the Hikmah section of this issue.\nsaid after quoting the hadith from Ab\u016b Hurayrah in  his  tafs\u012br,  \u201cHis  statement  {and  perform  rib\u0101t} means \u2018perform rib\u0101t for Allah\u2019s cause against your enemies and your religion\u2019s enemies from amongst the  people  of  shirk.\u2019  I  consider  the  linguistic root  of  rib\u0101t  to  be  binding  (irtib\u0101t)  the  horses in preparation for the enemy just as their enemy binds  their  horses  in  preparation  for  them.  The word  was  then  used  for  every  person  stationed at the frontier posts defending those behind him \u2013 throughout the area between him and them \u2013 those whom the enemy desires to harm with evil, whether the enemy has horses he has bounded or is on foot without a riding animal for himself. The reason we said that the meaning of {and perform rib\u0101t} is \u2018perform rib\u0101t against your enemies and your religion\u2019s enemies\u2019 is because this is the wellknown meaning of the meanings of rib\u0101t. Speech should  be  understood  according  to  the  people\u2019s prevalent  and  well-known  usages  from  amongst its meanings before resorting to the lesser-known meanings  until  a  proof  comes  with  something contrary  requiring  interpretation  of  the  speech according to a lesser-known meaning. This proof obligating submission would be a verse from the Qur\u2019\u0101n, a narration from the Messenger (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam), or ijm\u0101\u2019 (consensus) from the people of tafs\u012br.\u201d\nIbn  Qutaybah  (rahimahull\u0101h)  also  said,  \u201c{And perform rib\u0101t} for Allah\u2019s cause. And the linguistic basis  of  mur\u0101batah  (rib\u0101t)  is  a  bond:  That  these people bind their horses and that those ones bind their horses at the frontier post. Each prepares for his  counterpart.  So  the  presence  at  the  frontier posts was named rib\u0101t\u201d [Ghar\u012bb al-Qur\u2019\u0101n].\nMany  people  also  don\u2019t  realize  the  difference between rib\u0101t (defending the frontier posts) and hir\u0101sah (guard duty).

Similarly is the case if he agrees to stipulations of kufr \u2013 such as cooperating with the kuff\u0101r against the Muslims \u2013 so as to be permitted entry into d\u0101rul-kufr. This is kufr even if he does not go through with his promise. {Have you not considered those who practice hypocrisy, saying to their brothers who have disbelieved among the People of the Book, \u201cIf you are expelled, we will surely leave with you, and we will not obey, in regard to you, anyone \u2013 ever; and if you are fought, we will surely aid you.\u201d But Allah testifies that they are liars.

Thereafter, one should not be surprised when he sees the various factions in Sh\u0101m or elsewhere siding with the Sahwah, the taw\u0101gh\u012bt, or the crusaders, against the Islamic State.\nAfghanistan\nThe Western agentAhmad Shah Massoud\nAbdul Rasul Sayyaf (former head of the \u201cIslamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan,\u201d now a member of the t\u0101gh\u016bt parliament), Burhanuddin Rabbani (former head  of  the  \u201cIslamic  Society  of  Afghanistan,\u201d  died chairman  of  the  Afghan  High  Peace  Council),  and Ahmad  Shah  Massoud  (former  military  commander, died commander of the \u201cUnited Islamic Front\u201d), were all  former  leaders  of  the  major  factions  that  fought against the communist Russians and thereafter against the  communist  Afghans.  All  three  fought  alongside \u2018Abdull\u0101h \u2018Azz\u0101m  and were formerly praised by him in  his  speeches  and  letters.  After  the  collapse  of  the communist  Afghan  regime,  they  together  along with  others  established  the  so-called  \u201cIslamic  State of  Afghanistan\u201d  in  \u201c1992.\u201d  This  \u201cstate\u201d  would  later organize  the  \u201cUnited  Islamic  Front  for  the  Salvation of Afghanistan\u201d AKA the \u201cAfghan Northern Alliance,\u201d which fought on behalf of the crusaders and taw\u0101gh\u012bt, this  becoming  most  manifest  after  the  blessed operations of September 11th.\n1  Note:  Some  of  the  individuals  and  factions  that  will  be  mentioned  never  fought  for Allah\u2019s cause to begin with \u2013 similar to the condition of many of the factions in Sh\u0101m \u2013 and yet some of the ignorant consider them \u201cmuj\u0101hid\u012bn\u201d just because they fought against crusaders, communists, and other kuff\u0101r for nationalist reasons.\nTajikistan\nAbdullo Nuri (former head of the \u201cIslamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan\u201d) fought against the communists of Tajikstan. Am\u012br Khatt\u0101b of Chechnya \uf072 himself came to  Tajikistan  for  jih\u0101d  and  fought  alongside  various groups there, including those allied with Nuri. Nuri\u2019s group later signed a peace treaty with the communist apostates. The party then became a major member of the t\u0101gh\u016bt parliament, thereby apostatizing from Islam.\nLibya\nAbdelhakim  Belhadj  (Ab\u016b  \u2018Abdill\u0101h  as-S\u0101diq),  Abdel Wahab  Qaid  (Ab\u016b  Idr\u012bs  al-L\u012bb\u012b),  Abdel-Hakim  alHasidi,  S\u0101m\u012b  Mustaf\u0101  as-S\u0101\u2019id\u012b  (Abul-Mundhir  asS\u0101\u2019id\u012b),  were  all  former  members  of  the  \u201cLibyan Islamic  Fighting  Group\u201d  whose  leadership  was  based in  Afghanistan  before  September  11th  and  whose fighters executed numerous operations in Libya against the t\u0101gh\u016bt Gaddafi and his apostate regime.

Allah \uf063 said, {And He shares not His legislation with anyone} [Al-Kahf: 26].\nWe also write this for the wives of the Sahw\u0101t who superficially claim Islam and stuck out their necks for their secular-oriented brothers and supported them with their lives and with everything precious to them against the muwahidd\u012bn. \nAllah  \uf063  says,  {And  whoever  is  an  ally  to  them among  you  \u2013  then  indeed,  he  is  [one]  of  them} [Al-M\u0101\u2019idah: 51].\nFrom amongst the most beautiful stories found in the  books  of  history  is  the  story  of  Zaynab,  the daughter  of  the  Prophet  \uf067,  and  her  husband Abul-\u2018\u0100s Ibn ar-Rab\u012b\u2019, who were united by love and marriage, and split apart by kufr and shirk. Abul\u2018\u0100s married Zaynab, who was the daughter of his maternal aunt Khad\u012bjah \uf069. When the revelation descended upon the Prophet \uf067, Khad\u012bjah and her daughters believed in him and followed his religion, and this included Zaynab. Her husband Abul-\u2018\u0100s, however,  rejected  Islam  and  remained  upon  his shirk.  At  that  time,  Islam  had  divided  between every married couple where one of them followed other than Islam. Abul-\u2018\u0100s, however, held his wife with him in Makkah. Then, Allah \uf063 willed that he would fall prisoner to the Muslims in the battle of  Badr.  The  people  of  Makkah  sent  ransoms  to the Prophet \uf067. Here, the Mother of the Believers \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah Bint as-Sidd\u012bq \uf069 will continue the story for us. She said, \u201cWhen the people of Makkah sent ransoms for their imprisoned relatives, Zaynab the daughter of Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 sent some wealth as a ransom for Abul-\u2018\u0100s Ibn ar-Rab\u012b\u2019. She sent a necklace which Khad\u012bjah had her wear when she sent  her  to  Abul-\u2018\u0100s  to  move  in  with  him  after marriage.\u201d \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah said, \u201cWhen Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 saw it, he felt much pity for her. He said, \u2018If \nyou would like to free her prisoner and return her wealth to her then do so.\u2019 They said, \u2018Yes, O Allah\u2019s Messenger.\u2019 So they freed him and returned to her what  was  hers\u201d  [Reported  by  Im\u0101m  Ahmad  and Ab\u016b D\u0101w\u016bd].\nAnd  it\u2019s  reported  that  the  Prophet  \uf067  stipulated on  him  that  he  return  Zaynab  when  he  reaches Makkah because she was no longer lawful for him as long as he remained a mushrik. Abul-\u2018\u0100s did so, and  Zaynab  \uf069  left  for  al-Mad\u012bnah,  the  land  of Islam. Zaynab left Makkah out of love for Allah and in submission to His command, and did not put her husband and his companionship above the decree of Allah and His Messenger \uf067, because {it is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when  Allah  and  His  Messenger  have  decided  a matter,  that  they  should  have  any  choice  about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger  has  certainly  strayed  into  clear  error} [Al-Ahz\u0101b: 36].\nHowever, Allah wished to open Abul-\u2018\u0100s\u2019s heart to the truth many long years after his wife\u2019s hijrah, so he came to the Prophet \uf067 declaring his Islam, and so the Prophet returned Zaynab to him.\nThen  there\u2019s  Umm  Sulaym  Bint  Milh\u0101n  likewise refusing  to  marry  a  k\u0101fir  and  stipulating  that  he embraces Islam as her mahr (dowry). It was reported on the authority of Anas \uf068 who said, \u201cAb\u016b Talhah proposed to Umm Sulaym, so she said, \u2018By Allah, one  such  as  yourself  cannot  be  rejected,  O  Ab\u016b Talhah, but you are a k\u0101fir man and I am a Muslim woman, and it is not permissible for me to marry you. So if you embrace Islam, then that will be my mahr, and I will not ask from you other than that.\u2019 So  he  embraced  Islam  and  that  was  her  mahr\u201d [Reported by an-Nas\u0101\u2019\u012b and Ibn Hibb\u0101n].\nSo then that is Islam. It declares it loudly, clearly, and  explicitly:  {They  are  not  lawful  [wives]  for them,  nor  are  they  lawful  [husbands]  for  them} [Al-Mumtahanah: 10]. So there is no Islam with kufr,  no  tawhid  with  shirk,  and  no  \u012bm\u0101n  with nif\u0101q. And this small Muslim home is the core of the Ummah, and the parable of these two spouses and  their  children  is  like  that  of  a  plant  that \ndabiq\n\fThe Shar\u012b\u2019ah court in ad-D\u0101n\u0101 after being assaulted by the treacherous Sahw\u0101t\nAfter that, Allah blessed Sh\u0101m and its people by repelling and reversing the Sahwah Coalition\u2019s plot and by granting the Islamic State authority in  the  blessed  land  of  Sh\u0101m  and strengthening  its  religion  \u2013  the religion of the cheerful warrior \uf067 \u2013 in ar-Raqqah, al-Barakah, al-Khayr, Halab, Hims, and elsewhere. Then the conquests expanded in the east, thus  \u2018Ir\u0101q  was  liberated  in  Mosul, al-Anbar,  al-Fall\u016bjah,  Sal\u0101hudd\u012bn, Kark\u016bk  and  elsewhere.  And  its soldiers continue to hope for Allah\u2019s further  support  and  the  conquest of Constantinople and Rome.\nCoalition  and  its  councils  to  fail.  It  conquered some of the towns and villages in Sh\u0101m, like al-B\u0101b, I\u2019z\u0101z, ad-D\u0101n\u0101, and others which used to be ruled by the Nusayr\u012b regime and then by the resistant parties  like  the  Free  Syrian  Army  and  its  allies who resisted the Shar\u012b\u2019ah and its rulings. Thus, the Islamic State ruled those towns and villages with what Allah had sent down on His Messenger \uf067, established in them the hud\u016bd, commanded the good,  forbade  the  evil,  and  judged  between  the people by the Shar\u012b\u2019ah.\nTherefore,  the  groups  of  apostates,  hypocrites, innovators,  corruption  spreaders,  rebels,  and partisans  \u2013  having  diverse  hearts  but  allied  to one  another  \u2013  thought,  evaluated,  plotted, collaborated amongst each other, and all of them participated in the concocted treachery\u2026 A few supposedly \u201cneutral\u201d groups remained outside of this coalition, like a confused lamb, neither with this side nor the other, and Allah\u2019s help is sought.\nIn  the  beginning,  the  wicked  Sahwah  Coalition in  Sh\u0101m  consisted  of  \u201cJaysh  al-Muj\u0101hid\u012bn,\u201d  the \u201cIslamic Front,\u201d \u201cJabhat Thuw\u0101r S\u016briy\u0101,\u201d the Free Syrian Army, and the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front.11 Entering into a coalition is by cooperating with it on its aim. It is not a condition that the party signs a membership paper to join the coalition. Also, some of the jih\u0101d claimants persist on blatantly lying, claiming that the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front did not partake in the Sahwah. So what is then \u201cMajlis Sh\u016br\u0101 Muj\u0101hid\u012b ash-Sharqiyyah\u201d (Mishmish)? And what is \u201cLiw\u0101\u2019 Thuww\u0101r ar-Raqqah\u201d? (They were the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front\u2019s branch in Wil\u0101yat ar-Raqqah until the 16th of Jum\u0101d\u0101 al- \u0100khirah 1435, more than three months after the beginning of the Sahwah. They are the soldiers of the Syrian called \u201cAb\u016b Sa\u2019d al-Hadram\u012b.\u201d Now they are fighting in \u2018Ayn al-Isl\u0101m and Tall Abyad in one rank together with the Kurdish atheists while shielded by American air cover.)\uf067\nThe Islamic State did not conquer a city or village after this malicious plot except that it ruled it by the Shar\u012b\u2019ah of Allah. When the parties of deviance in ar-Raqqah consisting of \u201cAhr\u0101r ash-Sh\u0101m\u201d and the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front (or what is now known now as \u201cLiw\u0101\u2019  Thuww\u0101r  ar-Raqqa\u201d)  plotted  against  the muh\u0101jir\u012bn and ans\u0101r in it and acted treacherously against them, the muwahhid muj\u0101hid\u012bn expelled them  from  it,  humiliated.  Then  they  spread the  authority  of  the  Shar\u012b\u2019ah  over  the  complete wil\u0101yah.  They  enforced  prayer,  collected  zakah, and founded the Hisbah to command good and forbid evil. They executed the hud\u016bd, judged in their courts by what Allah revealed, returned the rights  of  the  oppressed,  fought  the  kuff\u0101r  and apostates,  and  enforced  the  jizyah  upon  AhlulKit\u0101b. Thus, ar-Raqqah witnessed what it had not witnessed before from the rulings of the Shar\u012b\u2019ah. Likewise  was  the  case  of  the  other  cities  and \uf067Indeed all the people of Halab know the role that the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front played in the Sahwah Coalition, since the interrogators in the Sahw\u0101t\u2019s prisons were security officers from the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front. And if a muh\u0101jir wanted safety, the Sahwah Coalition used to order him to surrender himself to the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front. And this was all done in cooperation with other factions from the Sahwah Coalition as \u201c\u2018Amr al-Halab\u012b\u201d mentioned in the first days of the Sahwah on the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front\u2019s favorite TV channel: AlJazeera\u2026One of the former members of Jawl\u0101n\u012b\u2019s \u201csh\u016br\u0101\u201d council who returned to the Islamic State\u2019s ranks informed us that Jawl\u0101n\u012b informed them in a gathering two weeks before the launching of the Sahwah plot, that the parties had agreed upon waging war against the Islamic State soon and that he had attended the gathering in which the decision was made. When he asked Jawl\u0101n\u012b about his front\u2019s role in that, Jawl\u0101n\u012b mentioned that he had pledged to cover the frontlines with the regime that would be weakened by this plot.

Completing wud\u016b\u2019 despite hardships (cold weather and minor wounds), taking many steps towards the mas\u0101jid (for prayer), and waiting for the next prayer after the prayer ends. Indeed,  this  (waiting)  is  rib\u0101t,\u201d  then  the  hadith is similar to those ah\u0101d\u012bth describing jih\u0101d to be exerting oneself in obedience to Allah, hijrah to be abandoning what Allah dislikes, and Islam to be good words and feeding the poor2. It doesn\u2019t limit the meaning of rib\u0101t to waiting for prayer nor does its wording indicate that it\u2019s a commentary on the \u0101yah.  For  this  reason,  at-Tabar\u012b  (rahimahull\u0101h) 2 See the Hikmah section of this issue.\nsaid after quoting the hadith from Ab\u016b Hurayrah in  his  tafs\u012br,  \u201cHis  statement  {and  perform  rib\u0101t} means \u2018perform rib\u0101t for Allah\u2019s cause against your enemies and your religion\u2019s enemies from amongst the  people  of  shirk.\u2019  I  consider  the  linguistic root  of  rib\u0101t  to  be  binding  (irtib\u0101t)  the  horses in preparation for the enemy just as their enemy binds  their  horses  in  preparation  for  them.  The word  was  then  used  for  every  person  stationed at the frontier posts defending those behind him \u2013 throughout the area between him and them \u2013 those whom the enemy desires to harm with evil, whether the enemy has horses he has bounded or is on foot without a riding animal for himself. The reason we said that the meaning of {and perform rib\u0101t} is \u2018perform rib\u0101t against your enemies and your religion\u2019s enemies\u2019 is because this is the wellknown meaning of the meanings of rib\u0101t. Speech should  be  understood  according  to  the  people\u2019s prevalent  and  well-known  usages  from  amongst its meanings before resorting to the lesser-known meanings  until  a  proof  comes  with  something contrary  requiring  interpretation  of  the  speech according to a lesser-known meaning. This proof obligating submission would be a verse from the Qur\u2019\u0101n, a narration from the Messenger (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam), or ijm\u0101\u2019 (consensus) from the people of tafs\u012br.\u201d\nIbn  Qutaybah  (rahimahull\u0101h)  also  said,  \u201c{And perform rib\u0101t} for Allah\u2019s cause. And the linguistic basis  of  mur\u0101batah  (rib\u0101t)  is  a  bond:  That  these people bind their horses and that those ones bind their horses at the frontier post. Each prepares for his  counterpart.  So  the  presence  at  the  frontier posts was named rib\u0101t\u201d [Ghar\u012bb al-Qur\u2019\u0101n].\nMany  people  also  don\u2019t  realize  the  difference between rib\u0101t (defending the frontier posts) and hir\u0101sah (guard duty). One might be on rib\u0101t but not  on  hir\u0101sah,  like  the  mur\u0101bit  at  the  frontier post sleeping, eating, exercising, talking, reading, or praying before or after his shift for hir\u0101sah. He might be a mur\u0101bit at the frontier post cooking and cleaning for the other mur\u0101bit\u012bn, waiting and prepared to defend the front against any attempt by the kuff\u0101r to advance, but never having a hir\u0101sah shift due to being needed in another service while \ndabiq\n\fAllah or that I know the unseen, nor do I tell you that I am an angel. I only follow what is revealed to  me\u201d}  [Al-An\u2019\u0101m:  50].  {Say,  \u201cIf  you  possessed the  depositories  of  the  mercy  of  my  Lord,  then you would withhold out of fear of spending.\u201d And ever has man been stingy} [Al-Isr\u0101\u2019: 100]. {Or have they the treasures of your Lord? Or are they the controllers [of them]?} [At-T\u016br: 37].\nAbsolute  power,  knowledge,  and  ownership  are attributes unique to Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101). This has always been  the  faith  of  Muslims  since  the  father  of mankind  \u2013  \u0100dam  (\u2018alayhis-sal\u0101m)  \u2013  treaded  the Earth  and  will  continue  to  be  so  until  the  last believer  passes  away  shortly  before  the  Hour. Only All\u0101h (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) knows the minutest details of everything, controls all events, and possesses every atomic particle. Even the pagans of the J\u0101hiliyyah in the Arabian Peninsula did not doubt that Allah alone  possessed  absolute  power,  knowledge,  and ownership,  but  they  committed  shirk  in  many ways  including  attributing  partial  knowledge  of the unseen to soothsayers, assigning shares of their crops  and  livestock  to  idols,  and  claiming  their idols held some influence to intercede for them. As for claiming their idols, soothsayers, and kings had absolute or near-absolute power, knowledge, \nand ownership, then this was too much for even the corrupted fitrah of the j\u0101hiliyy\u012bn to tolerate.\nSadly, this shirk\u012b attitude (both minor and major) entered the hearts and minds of many supposedly \u201cIslamic\u201d  leaders,  scholars,  and  callers  \u2013  in imitation of the Arab nationalists before them \u2013 as  they  began  to  describe  the  enemies  of  Islam with  attributes  bordering  rub\u016bbiyyah  (Allah\u2019s lordship).  To  them,  the  kuff\u0101r  had  the  nearabsolute knowledge, power, and ownership to plot and execute any grand conspiracy of their desire. It is almost as if they attribute to them the ability to create with the word \u201cbe\u201d! Their evil became most apparent in issues related to jih\u0101d. If one desired to perform jih\u0101d, these leaders would warn that jih\u0101d now was a conspiracy to kill off the sincere Muslim youth and thereby leave the Muslims\u2019 lands to the secularists. If one wanted to join a jih\u0101d jam\u0101\u2019ah, they  would  warn  that  it  was  the  creation  of  the kuff\u0101r so as to aid in achieving k\u0101fir interests. If jih\u0101d  operations  \u2013  like  those  of  September  11th \u2013 were carried out against the kuff\u0101r, they would claim  these  operations  were  conspiracies  by  the kuff\u0101r to justify their aggression against Muslims. If  a  muj\u0101hid  leader  achieved  shah\u0101dah,  they would say that the kuff\u0101r used him up and needed \nThe blessed raid on the Twin Towersin New York\ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "THE VIRTUES OF RIB\u0100T FOR THE CAUSE OF ALLAH", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "8"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq15-In-the-Words-of-the-Enemy", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "15", "schema:articleBody": "Christians and to destroy that vile race from the lands of  our  friends.\u201d  This  launched  the  Crusades,  which continue today. Popes thereafter, for centuries, overtly and loudly professed their goal of eradicating Islam through war and conversion, as the 15th century Pope Callixtus III made a vow \u201cto extirpate the diabolical sect of the reprobate and faithless Mahomet [Islam] in the East;\u201d and as his predecessor Eugene IV expressed his hope that \u201cvery many from the abominable sect of Mahomet will be converted to the Catholic faith\u201d (Council of Basel in 1434).\nAs the war between Islam and the pagan Church raged, and for fear of losing their own followers to Islam, some on the Christian side began speaking more directly about their enemy and the real Islamic goal to destroy their manmade systems and perverted \u201cfreedoms.\u201d Benedict XVI \u2013 the predecessor of Francis \u2013 explained, for example, that democracy \u201ccontradicts the essence of Islam, which simply does not have the separation of the political and the religious sphere that Christianity has had from the beginning\u201d (Truth and Tolerance). Despite being a liar, he certainly spoke the truth on this issue \u2013 democracy undoubtedly contradicts the essence of Islam \u2013 showing thereby that the apostates from Islam, like many of the \u201cimams\u201d in the West and teachers at so-called \u201cIslamic\u201d universities, have less of an understanding of Islam than Benedict the Disbeliever has.\nSome time later, Benedict would again attempt to disparage Islam by mocking the Prophet Muhammad g, but for something the Prophet shared with most of  the  prophets  of  the  Torah,  the  Psalms,  and  the Gospel, which was the order to spread the religion by the  sword.1  Benedict  thus  belittled  the  order  found in the Old and New Testaments for war against the pagans upon quoting the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, who had said, \u201cShow me just what Mohammed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.\u201d The religion of Islam will continue to be spread by the sword, even if Benedict despises such. May Allah expose  Benedict\u2019s  evil  and  inhumanity  and  uncover for the world the true reason behind his scandalous resignation from the pagan Papacy.\nDespite the clarity of past and perished popes re-\n1  To read biblical texts on the obligation of spreading the religion via the sword, see \u201cBy the Sword\u201d on pages 78-80 of this issue.\nBenedict XVI, Pope Francis\u2019 predecessor\ngarding their enmity for Islam and its teachings, the current pope, Francis, has struggled against reality to advertise the apostate\u2019s perversion of Islamic teachings as the actual religion of Muslims. So while Benedict and many before him emphasized the enmity between the  pagan  Christians  and  monotheistic  Muslims, Francis\u2019 work is notably more subtle, steering clear of confrontational words that would offend those who falsely claim Islam, those apostates whom the Crusaders found played the perfect role for their infiltration into Muslim lands. While Benedict XVI met public disapproval for quoting a centuries-old Byzantine emperor,  Francis  continues  to  hide  behind  a  deceptive veil of \u201cgood will,\u201d covering his actual intentions of pacifying the Muslim nation. This is exemplified in Francis\u2019 statement that \u201cour respect for true followers of Islam should lead us to avoid hateful generalizations, for authentic Islam and the proper reading of the Quran are opposed to every form of violence\u201d (The Joy of the Gospel).\nPart of this approach to subdue Muslims through appeasement  involves  coordinating  with  the  infamous Ash\u2019ari Sufi institute, al-Azhar University, falsely attributed to being representative of Sunni Muslims worldwide. This method is an attempt to justify deviating claims that the Muslim nation has no central authority \u2013 as in a caliphate \u2013 but is rather \u201cmanaged\u201d in some way by scholars at universities. Adnane Mokrani, a Tunisian slave to the Catholic Church, commented on Francis\u2019 embracing of Ahmed el-Tayeb \u2013 the leader of Cairo\u2019s al-Azhar University \u2013 saying, \u201cIslam is not like the Catholic Church. There is no single, central \n\fabominable practices that they have done for their gods, and so you sin against the Lord your God\u201d (Deuteronomy 20:16).And as David was quoted, saying to his enemy,  \u201cThis  day  the  Lord  will  deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head\u201d (1 Samuel 17:46), and after conquering him, he reportedly beheaded him. \u201cThen David ran and  stood  over  the  Philistine  [Goliath] and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with  it  \u2026  And  David  took  the  head  of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem \u2026 And as soon as David returned from the striking down of the Philistine, Abner took  him,  and  brought  him  before  Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand\u201d (1 Samuel 17:51-57).\nOnce the rule of the Lord was established, the sword was not to be put away but rather remain ever-unsheathed to implement the Law. The blasphemer was killed by stoning. \u201cWhoever blasphemes the name of the Lord shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him\u201d (Leviticus 24:16). As for the apostate or any who calls to worshiping other gods, then \u201cyou shall not yield to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him, nor shall you conceal him. But you shall kill him. Your hand shall be first against him to put him to death\u201d (Deuteronomy 13:8-9). Likewise, the murderer was executed.  \u201cWhoever  takes  a  human  life  shall  surely be  put  to  death\u201d  (Leviticus  24:17).  And  sodomites were slain. \u201cIf a man lies with a male as with a woman,  both  of  them  have  committed  an  abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them\u201d (Leviticus 24:13). Furthermore, there was retribution (known as \u201cqisas\u201d in the Shari\u2019ah). \u201cIf anyone injures his neighbor, as he has done it shall be done to him\u201d (Leviticus 24:19), and \u201cyou shall pay life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe\u201d (Exodus 21:23-25). In Psalms, a wisdom behind divinely-ordained killing is mentioned. \u201cWhen He killed them, they sought Him; they repented and sought  God  earnestly\u201d  (Psalms  78:34),  just  as  elsewhere in the Old Testament, one finds that \u201ccursed is he who keeps back his sword from bloodshed\u201d (Jeremiah 48:10).\nEven  Jesus,  whom  the  Christians  have  titled  the \nKilled for the abominable crime of sodomy\n\u201cPrince of Peace,\u201d is recorded in their scripture as saying, \u201cDo not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword\u201d (Matthew 10:34). There is also Jesus\u2019 order to his followers of being armed, as it is said, \u201cAnd let the one  who  has  no  sword  sell  his  cloak  and  buy  one\u201d (Luke 22:36). Also, while telling a parable, it is written that Jesus said, \u201cBut as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here  and  slaughter  them  before  me\u201d  (Luke  19:27). As for upholding the Law, then in an apparent move to command virtue and forbid vice, which is chiefly done with physical force, all four \u201cgospels\u201d mention the story of Jesus violently expelling the moneychangers from the temple. \u201cAnd Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. He said to them, \u2018It is written, \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer,\u2019 but you make it a den of robbers\u2019\u201d (Matthew  21:12-13).  Furthermore,  everything  that  was mentioned from the Old Testament of war and enforcing laws was kept, unless specifically mentioned otherwise, in the Gospel of Jesus. \u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them\u201d (Matthew 5:17).\nHowever, despite these clear references to violently applying  the  Law  of  the  Lord,  Christians  have  cast aside such commandments and instead have followed papal decrees and the sermons of priests \u2013 showing that their love for men is greater than their love for the Creator of men.

The word nuzz\u0101\u2019 is the plural of naz\u012b\u2019 and n\u0101zi\u2019, which refers to a stranger who breaks off from his family and tribe [meaning  he  departs  and  distances  himself  from  them], and the naz\u0101\u2019i\u2019 of the camels are the outsiders. AlHaraw\u012b (rahimahull\u0101h) said, \u2018By this he [the Prophet] is referring to the muh\u0101jir\u012bn who\u2019ve abandoned their homelands and migrated to Allah ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101\u2019\u201d [al-Q\u0101bid\u016bna \u2018alal-Jamr].\n\fWhen one experiences tribes of this nature after living years in the city, he realizes the wisdom in the words of Shaykh Ab\u016b Mus\u2019ab az-Zarq\u0101w\u012b (rahimahull\u0101h). It also becomes easier for him to tie events narrated in the Sunnah and S\u012brah of the Prophet (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  with  events  today.  He then  knows  why  the  Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  treated  the  Arab  and Israelite tribes as collective wholes whenever tribe members broke their covenants with him. This is also how after him, Ab\u016b Bakr as-Sidd\u012bq (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anh) dealt with the tribes during the wars of apostasy. In the prophetic and sidd\u012bq\u012b methodology, the tribes of the era were considered homogenous parties; unique individuals were treated as exceptional cases, not as the general rule. The fuqah\u0101\u2019 call these homogenous, collective  wholes  \u201ctaw\u0101\u2019if  mumtani\u2019ah,\u201d  if they resist the Shar\u012b\u2019ah. By definition, if the tribe does not act as a group in opposing the Shar\u012b\u2019ah, it would be obviously wrong to apply this ruling to its members.\nAfter this discussion, it should become clear why the Islamic State dealt with the clans of  Shu\u2019ayt\u0101t  as  a  murtadd  party  resisting the  Shar\u012b\u2019ah  with  arms.  These  clans  were left armed after they agreed to submit to the rule of the Shar\u012b\u2019ah with the condition they hand over all heavy weaponry. They then betrayed their covenant by rebelling against the Islamic State. They ambushed Islamic  State  soldiers,  and  then  tortured, amputated, and executed prisoners taken from the ambushes. All these crimes were carried  out  in  opposition  to  the  enforcement of the Shar\u012b\u2019ah.\nThereafter  the  Islamic  State  surrounded  their  villages  and  ordered  them  to hand over the perpetuators of the crimes against  Islam  and  the  Muslims.  The  majority of their clans refused to comply, and \nshu\u2019ayt\u0101t PRisONER s\nshu\u2019ayt\u0101t PRisONER s\neXecUtiOn OF shu\u2019ayt\u0101t tRaitORs\ndabiq\f", "schema:headline": "The islamic state before al-malhamah ", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "5"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq4-THE-REVIVAL-OF-SLAVERY-BEFORE-THE-HOUR-", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "4", "schema:articleBody": "ilies. Because of the Arabic terminologies used by this group either to describe themselves or their beliefs, some contemporary Muslim scholars  have  classified  them  as  possibly  an  apostate sect, not an originally mushrik religion, but upon  further  research,  it  was  determined  that this  group  is  one  that  existed  since  the  pre-Islamic j\u0101hiliyyah, but became \u201cIslamized\u201d by the surrounding Muslim population, language, and culture, although they never accepted Islam nor claimed to have adopted it. The apparent origin of the religion is found in the Magianism of ancient Persia, but reinterpreted with elements of Sabianism,  Judaism,  and  Christianity,  and  ultimately expressed in the heretical vocabulary of extreme Sufism.\nAccordingly,  the  Islamic  State  dealt  with  this group  as  the  majority  of  fuqah\u0101\u2019  have  indicated how mushrik\u012bn should be dealt with. Unlike the Jews and Christians, there was no room for jizyah payment. Also, their women could be enslaved unlike female apostates who the majority of the fuqah\u0101\u2019 say cannot be enslaved1  and can only be given an ultimatum to repent or face the sword. After capture, the Yazidi women and children were then divided according to the Shar\u012b\u2019ah amongst  the  fighters  of  the  Islamic  State  who participated in the Sinjar operations, after one fifth of the slaves were transferred to the Islamic State\u2019s authority to be divided as khums.\nThis large-scale enslavement of mushrik families is probably the first since the abandonment of this Shar\u012b\u2019ah law. The only other known case \u2013 albeit much smaller \u2013 is that of the enslavement of  Christian  women  and  children  in  the  Philippines and Nigeria by the muj\u0101hid\u012bn there.\nThe enslaved Yazidi families are now sold by the Islamic State soldiers as the mushrik\u012bn were sold by the Companions (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anhum) before _____________1     The enslavement of the apostate women belonging to apostate groups such as the r\u0101fidah, nusayriyyah, dur\u016bz, and ism\u0101\u2019\u012bliyyah is one that the fuqah\u0101\u2019 differ over. The majority of the scholars say that their women are not to be enslaved and only ordered to repent because of the had\u012bth, \u201cKill whoever changes his religion\u201d [Sah\u012bh al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b]. But some of the scholars including Shaykhul-Isl\u0101m Ibn Taymiyyah and the Ahn\u0101f (Hanafis) say they may be enslaved  due  to  the  actions  of  the  Companions  during  the  Wars  of  Apostasy where they enslaved the apostate women. This opinion is one also supported by evidence, wall\u0101hu a\u2019lam.\nthem.  Many  well-known  rulings  are  observed, including the prohibition of separating a mother from her young children. Many of the mushrik women and children have willingly accepted Islam and now race to practice it with evident sincerity after their exit from the darkness of shirk.\nRas\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  said, \u201cAllah marvels at a people who enter Jannah in chains\u201d [reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b on the authority of Ab\u016b Hurayrah]. The had\u012bth commentators mentioned that this refers to people entering Islam as slaves and then entering Jannah.\nAb\u016b Hurayrah (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anh) said while commenting on Allah\u2019s words, {You are the best nation  produced  for  mankind}  [\u0100li  \u2018Imr\u0101n:  110], \u201cYou are the best people for people. You bring them with chains around their necks, until they enter Islam\u201d [Sah\u012bh al-Bukh\u0101ri].\nYAZIDIS EMBRACE ISLAM\nAfter this discussion and as we approach al-Malhamah al-Kubr\u0101 (the greatest battle before the Hour) \u2013 whenever its time comes by Allah\u2019s decree \u2013 it is interesting to note that slavery has been mentioned as one of the signs of the Hour as well as one of the causes behind al-Malhamah al-Kubr\u0101.\nRas\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  mentioned that one of the signs of the Hour was that \u201cthe slave girl gives birth to her master.\u201d This was  reported  by  al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b  and  Muslim  on the authority of Ab\u016b Hurayrah and by Muslim on the authority of \u2018Umar.\ndabiq\fWILAYAT AL-FURAT\nA CHECKPOINT TO PROTECT THE MUSLIMS OF THE NEW WIL\u0100YAH\nISLAMIC POLICE IN THE NEW WIL\u0100YAH\nTHE MARKET IN THE NEW WIL\u0100YAH\ndabiq\f", "schema:headline": "THE REVIVAL OF SLAVERY BEFORE THE HOUR ", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "14"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq14-Among-the-Believers-Are-Men", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "14", "schema:articleBody": "expenses in an equally cunning manner. Thus, with the mercy of Allah, Ab\u016b Jandal was able to proceed on his hijrah to Sh\u0101m. He walked towards Allah, and Allah came running to him, as He had promised the believers.\nWhen the news leaked that Ab\u016b Jandal had left the country for the Middle East and had not attended the conference, his murtadd maternal uncle, who is connected  with  Bengali  military  intelligence  agency DGFI  (Directorate  General  of  Forces  Intelligence), tried his best to prevent him from entering Sh\u0101m. Despite the efforts of his uncle and the DGFI, however, Ab\u016b  Jandal,  by  Allah\u2019s  grace,  succeeded  in  entering Sh\u0101m with great ease, underscoring what the Prophet g had said to the young companion \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s  j, \u201cKnow that if the whole world were to gather  together  in  order  to  benefit  you  something, they would not be able to benefit you with anything other than that which Allah had written for you. And if they were to gather together in order to harm you with something, they would not be able to harm you except with that which Allah had written against you\u201d [Reported  by  at-Tirmidh\u012b].\nUpon entering the blessed land of Sh\u0101m, his heart was full of joy, and he became the youngest brother among the Bengali muh\u0101jir\u012bn. As soon as he joined the  training  camp,  he  informed  the  trainer  that  he wanted to carry out an istishh\u0101d\u012b operation and added his name to the list. He was always cheerful and smiling. While awaiting his turn to carry out an istishh\u0101d\u012b operation, he joined a battalion and was stationed in rib\u0101t in \u2018Ayn al-Isl\u0101m. Despite his rib\u0101t and fighting, his heart was always concerned for the brothers in his former homeland and the progress of jih\u0101d there. He dreamed of Bengal becoming a frontline for the Islamic State and a graveyard for the murtadd\u012bn. When he would come back to the city from rib\u0101t, he would rush to the brothers and inquire about the progress in Bengal. \nHe also used to give sincere nas\u012bhah to the brothers here, and despite growing up in a wealthy family, he always tried to distance himself from city life, preferring instead the toils of jih\u0101d. Before leaving to partake in one of the battles in \u2018Ayn \u2018\u012as\u0101, he informed a brother that he did not want to stay in the city and was trying to move to the mountains of Wil\u0101yat Dimashq. At the time, Ramad\u0101n was approaching, and his heart was attached to shah\u0101dah. He told the brothers with him of his desire for shah\u0101dah and prayed that Allah would accept him in the month of Ramad\u0101n. He then left for the battle in \u2018Ayn \u2018\u012as\u0101 as an inghim\u0101s\u012b. During the course of the operation, he was shot by a 23mm autocannon. The medical team evacuated him from the battlefield and attempted to give him first aid, but he died due to excessive bleeding. The doctor on duty \ninformed the brothers with him that before his last breath he pronounced the shah\u0101dah. \nPrior to heading out for the inghim\u0101s\u012b operation, Ab\u016b Jandal wrote the following letter to his brothers in Islam:\n\u201cIn  the  name  of  Allah,  the  Most  Gracious,  the Most Merciful. All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the Universe, the only one worthy of worship, the only one whose laws will prevail all over the world, the only one in whom the believers should put their trust and hope. To proceed.\u201d\n\u201cThis  is  a  sincere  message  from  your  beloved brother living in the blessed lands of the Islamic State. Verily it is Allah\u2019s laws and the sacrifice of the brothers that makes a land blessed. Y\u0101 ikhw\u0101n\u012b fill\u0101h, four or five months ago I was in the same position as you. I didn\u2019t have any plan as to how to avoid the fitnah surrounding me. I didn\u2019t know how I would ever be able to do jih\u0101d f\u012b sab\u012blill\u0101h. I thought that all my family and friends would boycott me. I was drowning in the same obstacles that you might be going through now. But it is only the promise of Allah, the promise of that Garden in which rivers flow, that kept me going. And it was enough, insh\u0101\u2019all\u0101h.\u201d\n\u201cThe following are some points of nas\u012bhah, which I am trying hard to follow and would hope that you, my beloved brothers, would also try to follow. Please note that it is just my duty to give sincere advice to you. Otherwise, I am too small and too sinful to give you advice.\u201d\u2022  \u201cQiy\u0101m al-layl. Y\u0101 akh\u012b, it had been the solution for the Sah\u0101bah, has been the solution for the brothers, and it will be the same for you, insh\u0101\u2019all\u0101h. Try getting up 15 minutes before Fajr and praying two raka\u2019ah of qiy\u0101m al-layl. When you get used to it, then increase by 15 minutes. Is this so hard?\u201d\n\u2022  \u201cTry to make the Qur\u2019\u0101n your best companion. Read it, listen to it, memorize it, spend much time with it, apply it. It is better than gossiping with the  brothers.\u201d\n\u2022  \u201cTry to do regular physical exercise at home. Don\u2019t \nskip this point.\u201d\nIndeed,  Ab\u016b  Jandal  was  among  those  brothers who were not satisfied with merely reaching the lands of the Khil\u0101fah and partaking in jih\u0101d for the cause of Allah. One can see from his letter that despite being involved in jih\u0101d, one of the greatest acts of sacrifice and worship, he continually sought to improve himself and strengthen his relationship with his Lord. May Allah accept him among the shuhad\u0101\u2019 and inspire many more through his words and deeds.\n51\fIt\u2019s a little weird re-visiting all of this more than a year and a half later, but it\u2019s important to reflect on what history has clearly shown was one of the bloodiest and worst-handled hostage crises in modern times. This  was  not  just  my  observation  but  a  sentiment aired by journalists in other pieces published on the matter  subsequently.\nThe stupidity of hardline non-negotiation was obvious at the time as my cellmates were beheaded one after the other. Since most countries choose to negotiate, either above or below the table (and everyone chooses to deal below), then by being the hardliner who does not agree to talk, all you\u2019re doing is condemning your imprisoned citizens to death. Nothing more. You\u2019re not making a big political stand because the whole thing\u2019s invisible and not in the media, you\u2019re not  showing  the  world  how  tough  you  are  for  the same reasons, in fact you\u2019re not making any difference to the global position on hostage-taking whatsoever. The captors don\u2019t check your passport when they grab you and say, \u201cOh look, this one\u2019s British. We better let him go and just keep all the French instead.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work like that.\nAll you\u2019re doing is just condemning citizens who have gotten themselves into a sticky situation for the sake of a few million dollars which \u2013 let\u2019s be honest \u2013 doesn\u2019t go very far in today\u2019s world. The Islamic State pumps millions of dollars a day in oil revenue so they don\u2019t even need the proceeds from ransoms and haven\u2019t for quite some time. I don\u2019t claim to speak for them, but I believe it\u2019s reasonable to say that the muj\u0101hid\u012bn continue to seek ransoms only to uphold an order dictated in the Qur\u2019\u0101n. {When you meet those \nwho  disbelieve,  strike  their  necks  until,  when  you have inflicted slaughter upon them, then secure their bonds, and either confer favor afterwards or ransom them until the war lays down its burdens} [Muhammad: 4].\nMake no mistake about it, the muj\u0101hid\u012bn follow the  Qur\u2019\u0101n  to  the  letter,  say  what  they  mean,  and mean what they say. They don\u2019t play games, a fact that was not lost on the European countries whose citizens were prisoners. America, on the other hand, chose to glibly ignore the disaster that was coming their way and today spends more in one day of dropping bombs over the Islamic State as it would have taken to get 26 year-old Kayla Mueller home. Thanks to US policy at the time, all her family got instead was evidence that she was killed by a coalition bomb in ar-Raqqah and a candlelight vigil at their hometown of Prescott, Arizona.\nSo a few months back I watched with interest a 27-minute documentary entitled \u201cThe Cost of Living\u201d that was aired on ABC Australia last June. The presenter of the program, Jonathan Holmes, interviewed one  of  my  former  cellmates,  Frenchman  Nicholas Henin. Nic was a peculiar fish but I rather enjoyed his company because he was quiet and said completely weird things. One of my favourite Nic-isms was when he got a sound thrashing from a guard for throwing bread down the toilet and he announced to the room in a high-pitched voice, who had just watched him sail past the door on his head before getting a pretty decent one-two in front of all of us, that \u201cI have just been beeeeeee-ten!\u201d Ah, such happy days.\nWhen  they  got  home  the  four  French  went  on \nNicholas Henin\n\f", "schema:headline": "Among the Believers Are Men", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "50"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah10", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq11-INTERVIEW-WITH-ABUL-MUGH\u012aRAH-AL-QAHT\u0100N\u012a", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "The  soldiers  of  the  Khil\u0101fah  take  control  of the eastern coast of the city of Darnah\nState fights the apostates of the Libyan army at a number of  locations  near  the  city  of  Bingh\u0101z\u012b,  most  important of which are as-S\u0101bir\u012b and al-Layth\u012b. The Islamic State also has some frontlines against them near Darnah, most important of which are Mart\u016bbah and an-Naww\u0101r. The Islamic  State  also  targets  their  locations  in  the  city  of Ajd\u0101biy\u0101.

And how did it all begin? And what is the history of this \u201cmajlis\u201d with regards to Islam or kufr?\nAbul-Mugh\u012brah:  This  council  consists  of  two  major elements:  \u201cAb\u016b  Sal\u012bm  Martyrs  Brigade\u201d  and  the \u201cLibyan  Islamic  Fighting  Group.\u201d  As  for  the  \u201cLibyan Islamic  Fighting  Group,\u201d  then  its  kufr  is  clear  due  to its  participation  in  the Tar\u0101bulus  government  and  the democratic process under the leadership of Abdelhakim Belhadj. As for the \u201cAb\u016b Sal\u012bm Martyrs Brigade,\u201d then it was a brigade that was once Salaf\u012b. Most of the soldiers of the Islamic State in Darnah were from the brigade\u2019s founders. They abandoned the brigade after it fell into a number of nullifiers of Islam, most infamous of which was its operating as part of the interior ministry in what was known as the \u201csecurity committee.\u201d This is in addition to  their  security  for  the  t\u0101gh\u016bt  Mustafa  Abdul  Jalil, Chairman of the National Transitional Council, when he visited Darnah and called to democracy. Since then, the people of proper methodology abandoned the brigade. They even killed leaders of the brigade who led it to the depths of kufr. All this was before the official expansion of the Islamic State to Libya. After Allah blessed it with \nexpansion to Libya and most of the groups in Darnah pledged  bay\u2019ah  to  it,  the  Ab\u016b  Sal\u012bm  brigade  requested its opponents from the other groups refer to the court of the Islamic State for a resolution. After studying the condition of the brigade and what it fell into, the court of the Islamic State ruled that the brigade had committed apostasy  and  called  its  individuals  to  repentance.  A number of its followers and leaders repented whereas the remaining  gathered  together  with  the  \u201cLibyan  Islamic Fighting Group\u201d to form what they called \u201cMajlis Sh\u016br\u0101 Darnah.\u201d\nD\u0101biq: What is the situation with Ans\u0101r ash-Shar\u012b\u2019ah?\nAbul-Mugh\u012brah:  Many  of  the  leaders  and  soldiers  of Ans\u0101r ash-Shar\u012b\u2019ah were from the first to pledge bay\u2019ah in  Libya  to  the  Islamic  State.  This  group  continues  to have men who wish to implement the Shar\u012b\u2019ah despite the  groups\u2019  abandonment  of  the  lost  obligation  of  the era and its preference of division to unity, most clear in its lack of a bay\u2019ah to the Khal\u012bfah and in its unity with \u201crevolutionary\u201d movements linked to the apostate regime of Tar\u0101bulus in some regions as well as its acceptance in other regions of suspicious aid from filthy hands. It also has contradictory stances from region to region due to the different orientations of its leaders and the alignments of its soldiers.

Their bay\u2019ah was acknowledged by the Islamic State, and the muj\u0101hid\u012bn of West Africa now guard yet another frontier of the Khil\u0101fah. \nThe  Islamic  State\u2019s  spokesman,  Shaykh  Ab\u016b Muhammad  al-\u2018Adn\u0101n\u012b  (hafidhahull\u0101h),  said, \u201cAnd  we  bring  you  the  good  news  today  of the  Khil\u0101fah\u2019s  expansion  to  West  Africa,  for the  Khal\u012bfah  (hafidhahull\u0101h)  has  accepted  the pledge  of  allegiance  made  by  our  brothers  in Jam\u0101\u2019at  Ahlis-Sunnah lid-Da\u2019wah  wal-Jih\u0101d. We congratulate the Muslims and our muj\u0101hid brothers  in  West  Africa  on  their  pledge  of allegiance,  and  we  congratulate  them  on joining the caravan of the Khil\u0101fah. So rejoice, O Muslims, for this is a new door that Allah, the Mighty  and  Majestic,  has  opened  so  that  you may  migrate  to  the  land  of  Islam  and  so  that \nyou  may  wage  jih\u0101d.  So  whoever  is  stopped by the disbelieving rulers, and prevented from emigrating  to  Iraq,  Sh\u0101m,  Yemen,  the  Arabian Peninsula,  or  Khur\u0101s\u0101n,  will  not  be  prevented \u2013  by  Allah\u2019s  permission  \u2013  from  emigrating  to Africa. So come, O Muslims, to your State, for we call on you to mobilize for jih\u0101d and incite you and invite you to emigrate to your brothers in West Africa. And we specifically call upon the students of Islamic knowledge and the callers to Islam. Come forth, O Muslims, to the land of the Caliphate\u201d [So They Kill and Are Killed].\nFollowing the announcement of the bay\u2019ah, and its acceptance by the Islamic State, the Muslims in the various regions of the Khil\u0101fah took to the streets in celebration, for nothing brings greater joy to the believers than to see their brothers unite  with  them  under  one  banner  and  one im\u0101m, pledging to wage war against kufr until the religion is entirely for Allah. The condition of the muj\u0101hid\u012bn in West Africa was a condition of unity upon tawh\u012bd, which saw them rallying behind one leader from amongst them to wage war  against  kufr  and  implement  the  Shar\u012b\u2019ah in  their  land.  So  when  they  saw  the  Muslims, \ndabiq\n\fRas\u016blull\u0101h (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) said, \u201cAllah  (\u2018azza  wa  jall)  does  not  accept  any deed from a mushrik after he accepts Islam until he departs from the mushrik\u012bn and goes to the Muslims\u201d [Reported by Ibn M\u0101jah and an-Nas\u0101\u2019\u012b on the authority of Mu\u2019\u0101wiyah Ibn Haydah].\nThe  Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam) took  the  hand  of  Jar\u012br  Ibn  \u2018Abdill\u0101h  (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anh) and said to him, \u201cI take your bay\u2019ah (pledge) to worship Allah alone, establish the prayer, give the zak\u0101h, advise the Muslims,  and  depart  from  the  mushrik\u012bn\u201d [Reported by Im\u0101m Ahmad and an-Nas\u0101\u2019\u012b].\ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "ISLAMIC STATE REPORTS", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "14"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq13-DO-THEY-NOT-THEN-REFLECT-ON-THE-QUR\u2019\u0100N", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "13", "schema:articleBody": "every  individual  from  your  Ummah  is,  {So  fight  in  the cause  of  Allah;  you  are  not  held  responsible  except  for yourself}.\u2019 And for this reason, it is incumbent on every believer to wage jih\u0101d, even if he has to do so alone. And in that regard is the statement of the Prophet \uf067, \u2018By Allah, I will surely fight them even if I\u2019m alone\u2019 [Reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b from al-Miswar and Marw\u0101n], and also the statement of Ab\u016b Bakr when the apostasy occurred, \u2018And if my right hand were to oppose me, I would wage jih\u0101d against it with my left hand.\u2019\u2019\u201d\nThis statement of al-Qurtub\u012b, along with those of other mufassir\u012bn, highlights the magnitude of what the believers have been burdened with. The matter of believing in Allah and then striving to raise high His kalimah \u2013 l\u0101 il\u0101ha illall\u0101h \u2013 is so significant that if one had no choice but to march forth and fight by himself to achieve this, he would have to do so. As such, Allah \uf063 reminds His Messenger \uf067 and the believers that each individual is only responsible for himself. He should not look around and base his decision to make hijrah and wage jih\u0101d for the cause of Allah on what other people are doing. Nor should he hesitate to strike the enemies of Allah \uf063 if it\u2019s within his means to do so, even if he were alone.\nOn the statement of Allah, {You are not held responsible except for yourself}, Ibn Kath\u012br mentions a report from Ibn Ab\u012b H\u0101tim that al-Bar\u0101\u2019 Ibn \u2018\u0100zib h was asked if a man who encountered a hundred of the enemy and fought them was considered to be from those about whom Allah said, {And do not throw yourselves with your own hands into destruction} [Al-Baqarah: 195]. He replied, \u201cAllah \uf063 said to His Prophet, {So fight in the cause of Allah; you are not held responsible except for yourself. And encourage the believers [to fight]}.\u201d\nThus, the believer should be prepared to fight alone when necessary  and  to  incite  others  to  join  him  in  jih\u0101d.  He should  not  be  discouraged  by  a  lack  of  numbers  and should  understand  that  the  rewards  of  a  good  deed  are multiplied  when  one  faces  greater  difficulty  in  carrying them out, as is the case when one finds no one to support him in fighting the kuff\u0101r, yet courageously marches forward and terrorizes the enemies of Allah nonetheless.\nIn his tafs\u012br of the aforementioned \u0101yah, al-Qurtub\u012b then explains the statement of Allah {That perhaps Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve}, saying, \u201cAllah restrained the might of the mushrik\u012bn at Badr as-Sughr\u0101 (the  Minor  Badr)  and  they  went  back  on  what  they promised the Prophet \uf067 of war and fighting1  \u2026 Allah 1   The Minor Badr refers to an appointment for battle between the Prophet \uf067 and the mushrik\u012bn of Quraysh two years after the decisive battle of Badr. The Prophet \uf067 and his companions camped at Badr for eight days waiting for the enemy to arrive. The mushrik\u012bn halted their march towards Badr when they reached the area of Marr adh-Dhahr\u0101n, \n{And Allah is greater in might and stronger in punishment} [An-Nis\u0101\u2019: 84]\nalso sufficed the believers at al-Hudaybiyah of what the mushrik\u012bn sought to carry out of treachery and opportunism. Thus, the believers sensed their plot and headed out, capturing them as prisoners, and this occurred as the envoys were going between them to negotiate a truce.2 This is  what  is  intended  by  His  \uf063  statement,  {And  it  is  He who withheld their hands from you} [Al-Fath: 24] \u2026 And Allah  cast  terror  into  the  hearts  of  the  factions  [during al-Khandaq]  and  they  departed  without  any  killing  or fighting, as He  \uf063 said, {And Allah spared the believers from having to fight}. Likewise, the Jews left their homes and their wealth [near al-Mad\u012bnah] without the Muslims battling  them.  So  all  this  is  might  that  Allah  restrained from afflicting the believers, in addition to a large number of Jews and Christians leaving off war and entering into the jizyah agreement in humiliation and submissively. Thus, Allah restrained their might from the believers.\u201d\nThese words altogether carry a monumental lesson for the \nand decided to forego the battle and return to Makkah due to their fear.2   This refers to an incident that took place when the Prophet \uf067 was encamped  outside  Makkah  as  the  treaty  of  Hudaybiyah  was  being negotiated with Quraysh. The more zealous youth of Quraysh saw that their leaders wanted a treaty with the Prophet \uf067, so they sought to devise a plan that would ruin the negotiations. They decided to head out at night and stealthily move towards the Muslim encampment where they would take action and attempt to ignite a war. Around seventy or eighty of them went out and descended from Mount at-Tan\u2019\u012bm, attempting to sneak towards the Muslim camp, but were all captured by Muhammad Ibn Maslamah, the commander of the Muslim guard. The Prophet \uf067 later freed them all to ensure the successful negotiation of the treaty. In this regard, Allah \uf063 revealed the \u0101yah, {And it is He who withheld their hands from you and your hands from them within the area of Makkah after He caused you to overcome them} [Al-Fath: 24].\n\fThe R\u0101fidah and the Jews\nWho Was Ibn Saba\u2019?\nThe Jew Ibn Saba\u2019, like Paul, hated Islam and desired to deviate the Muslims and corrupt their religion by innovating deviant concepts including the godhood, lordship, and second coming of \u2018Al\u012b Ibn Ab\u012b T\u0101lib h. At the same time, he strived to create strife amongst the Muslim ranks, inciting against the Righteous Khal\u012bfah \u2018Uthm\u0101n h until \u2018Uthm\u0101n was killed. The killing of \u2018Uthm\u0101n led to the deaths of more Muslims and the eventual emergence of the Khaw\u0101rij, who assassinated \u2018Al\u012b h, who Ibn Saba\u2019 had once claimed was Allah!\nAbout him, Ibn Taymiyyah r said, \u201cThe first to innovate Rafd was a heretical hypocrite named \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn Saba\u2019. He wanted thereby to corrupt the religion of the Muslims like Paul \u2013 the author of the letters read by the Christians \u2013 innovated for the Christians heresies by which he corrupted their religion. Paul was a Jew who hypocritically faked Christianity with the intent to corrupt it. Ibn Saba\u2019 was also a Jew intending the same. He strived to spread falsehood aiming to corrupt the religion, but was unable to do so. However,  some  discord  and  strife  occurred  amongst  the Muslims, strife in which \u2018Uthm\u0101n h was killed. Thereafter the fitnah transpired\u201d [Majm\u016b\u2019 al-Fat\u0101w\u0101].\nAt-Tabar\u012b r said in his t\u0101r\u012bkh, \u201cIbn Saba\u2019 adopted Islam during the khil\u0101fah of \u2018Uthm\u0101n. He then toured the Muslims\u2019 lands, trying to deviate them. He started with al-Hij\u0101z, then al-Basrah, then al-K\u016bfah, then ash-Sh\u0101m. He did not succeed in launching his plot amongst the people of Sh\u0101m. They eventually expelled him. He then went to Egypt and called its people. Amongst what he said to them was, \u2018How strange are a people who claim that \u2018\u012as\u0101 will return but deny that  Muhammad  will  return,  whereas  Allah \uf062  said,  {Indeed,  He  who  imposed  upon  you  the  Qur\u2019\u0101n  will  bring you back to a returning place} [Al-Qasas: 85].2 Therefore, 2   The scholars of tafs\u012br say that the verse was a promise to the Prophet \uf067 that he would once again return to Makkah after being forced out from it.\nThe T\u0101bi\u2019\u012b ash-Sha\u2019b\u012b r (died 104AH) said, \u201cI warn you against the followers of deviant desires. And the worst of them are the R\u0101fidah, as they are the Jews of this Ummah. Some of them are Jews who fake Islam to spread their deviance, just as Paul of the Jews faked Christianity to spread his deviance, hoping the Jews would become victorious. The R\u0101fidah hate Islam just as the Jews hate Christianity. They did not enter Islam longing for Allah or fearing Him, rather out of spite for the people of Islam and so as to  inflict  harm  upon  them.  Their  prayers  do  no  exceed their ears. Indeed, \u2018Al\u012b h burned them alive and banished them  to  other  lands.  Amongst  them  was  \u2018Abdull\u0101h  Ibn Saba\u2019, a Jew from the Jews of Sanaa, who was banished to S\u0101b\u0101t.\u201d\nHe r also said, \u201cIndeed, the calamity of the R\u0101fidah is the same as the calamity of the Jews. The Jews say that only a person from the lineage of D\u0101w\u016bd is suited for kingship. The R\u0101fidah say that only a person from the lineage of \u2018Al\u012b is suited for im\u0101mah. The Jews say that there is no jih\u0101d until the Messiah comes forth and a sword descends from the heavens. The R\u0101fidah say there is no jih\u0101d until the Mahd\u012b comes forth and a caller calls out from the heavens saying, \u2018Follow him.\u2019 The Jews distorted the Tawr\u0101h. The R\u0101fidah did the same, distorting the Qur\u2019\u0101n. The Jews are not truthful when they say sal\u0101m to the believers, rather they say, \u2018May s\u0101m be upon you.\u2019 And s\u0101m means death. The R\u0101fidah are the same. The Jews consider the wealth of all people to be hal\u0101l, as Allah described them in the Qur\u2019\u0101n as saying, {\u201cThere is no blame upon us concerning the illiterate [meaning the Arabs]\u201d} [\u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 75]. The R\u0101fidah are the same, as they consider the wealth of all Muslims to be hal\u0101l. The Jews consider the blood of all Muslims to be hal\u0101l. The R\u0101fidah  are  the  same.  The  Jews  consider  the  cheating  of people to be hal\u0101l. The R\u0101fidah are the same. The Jews hate Jibr\u012bl and say he is their enemy from amongst the angels. The R\u0101fidah are the same, as some of them claim that Jibr\u012bl mistakenly descended with revelation upon Muhammad \uf067 and abandoned \u2018Al\u012b h.\u201d1\nThis is a reality of which there is no doubt. The Jews and the R\u0101fidah are two sides of the same coin. The religion of Rafd (\u201cShiism\u201d) was nothing but a plot by a Jew \u2013 Ibn Saba\u2019 \u2013 following the footsteps of his Jewish predecessor Paul, who had corrupted the pure religion of the Messiah \uf06e, leaving the Christians upon the Pauline deviance and heresies of the cross, original sin, incarnation, atonement, the lordship, divine sonhood, and godhead of the Messiah, and antinomianism (abandonment of the Law of M\u016bs\u0101 \uf06e).\n1   The various statements of ash-Sha\u2019b\u012b were reported by al-Khall\u0101l in \u201cAs-Sunnah,\u201d  al-L\u0101lik\u0101\u2019\u012b  in  \u201cSharh  Us\u016bl  al-I\u2019tiq\u0101d,\u201d  Ibn Taymiyyah  in \u201cMinh\u0101j  as-Sunnah,\u201d  and  others.\nThe R\u0101fidah of Iran dedicate a memorial  to  dead  Iranian  Jews\n\f", "schema:headline": "DO THEY NOT THEN REFLECT ON THE QUR\u2019\u0100N", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "28"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq8-IN-THE-WORDS-OF-THE-ENEMY", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "see  this  group  as  an  Islamic  group, and it\u2019s an Islamic terrorist group but it\u2019s a terrorist group that has become a  nation-state.

We  wanted  to  cause chaos (tawahhush) in the lands by killing Brahmi so as to facilitate the brothers\u2019 movements and so that we would be able to bring in weapons and liberate our brothers from prisons.

Allah (\u2018azza wa jall) facilitated the matter so we did not find difficulty. We stayed four hours in front of the home of this tyrant, waiting, until he left the  home  and  entered  his  car.  I  then  moved towards  him  and  killed  him  by  shooting  ten bullets at him.\nD\u0100BIQ: Can you tell us about the assassination of  the  murtadd  Chokri  Belaid  (coordinator  of the  Democratic  Patriots\u2019  Movement)  and  the \n60 INTERVIEW\nbrothers who took part in the operation?\nAB\u016a  MUQ\u0100TIL:  The  assassination  of  Chokri Belaid was carried out by our brother Ab\u016b Sayy\u0101f Kam\u0101l  Gafg\u0101z\u012b  (may  Allah  accept  him).  Our brother Lutf\u012b az-Zayn (may Allah accept him) was with him in the operation.

Rather  he  fought  merely  to  unify  the \u201cArab\u201d lands alone under a nationalist \u201ccaliphate\u201d that he would rule over, but under the direction of his new crusader masters.\nDuring the various battles he and his sons led in the \u201cArab Revolt,\u201d their soldiers were accompanied and  supported  by  British  crusaders  including Colonel  Cyril  Wilson,  Colonel  Pierce  C.  Joyce, Lieutenant  Colonel  Stewart  Francis  Newcombe, Herbert Garland, and Captain T.E. Lawrence (the so-called \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d), French crusaders including  Colonel  Edouard  Bremond,  Captain Rosario  Pisanim,  Claude  Prost,  and  Laurent Depui,  and  French  apostates  including  Captain Muhammad  Ould  Ali  Raho.  The  British  would even  intervene  with  their  navy  and  air  force  in battles to give al-Husayn and his sons the upper hand against their rivals. Al-Husayn and his sons meticulously obeyed the orders dictated to them by  the  British  crusaders  so  as  to  guarantee  their backing.  The  British  eventually  appointed  them as kings over Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Hij\u0101z. The current  t\u0101gh\u016bt  of  Jordan  is  a  descendent  of  this same family.\nBlack  was  chosen  to  represent  the  \u2018Abb\u0101s\u012b  state, white  to  represent  the  Umaw\u012b  state,  green  to represent the \u2018Ubayd\u012b (\u201cF\u0101tim\u012b\u201d) state, and red to represent  the  late  \u201cShar\u012bf\u201d2  leadership  of  Hij\u0101z. In  this  symbolism,  he  mixed  between  Islamic khulaf\u0101\u2019,  apostate  Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bliyyah,  and  apostate agents.  He  needed  to  give  his  Arab  followers something  symbolic,  historical,  material,  and uniquely  \u201cArabian\u201d  for  them  to  rally  around. This j\u0101hil\u012b banner became the flag of the so-called \u201cArab Revolt\u201d he engineered. The flag was initially manufactured in Egypt by the British Military to be raised by their allies.\nSykes\u2019s allies from amongst the Arab nationalists used  a  line  of  poetry  written  by  Saf\u012b  ad-D\u012bn  alHill\u012b  \u2013  who  died  in  750AH  \u2013  to  endorse  these j\u0101hil\u012b symbols. Al-Hill\u012b said, \u201cOur deeds are white, our battles are black, our fields are green, and our swords are red.\u201d No doubt, his line of poetry was written hundreds of years before the \u201cArab Revolt.\u201d\nSykes, together with his peers and leaders, devised a  plan  to  further  divide  the  broken  Muslims\u2019 lands  into  nationalist  states.  The  Muslims\u2019  lands had  been  polluted  by  pagan  domes  (for  grave worship)  and  plagued  by  manmade  laws  at  the hands of Ottoman rulers, especially in the last two centuries before the eventual collapse of Ottoman reign.  This  fragile  condition  coupled  with  the policy of turkification \u2013 which promoted Turkish nationalism and degraded the Arabic language \u2013 aided Sykes and his allies in promoting the \u201cArab Revolt.\u201d\nThe  British  began  negotiating  with alHusayn  Ibn  \u2018Al\u012b3    (the  \u201cShar\u012bf\u201d  of  Hij\u0101z  \u2013  died 1350AH/1931CE)  to  rebel  and  declare  an independent  Arab  nationalist  state.  Al-Husyan Ibn  \u2018Al\u012b  revolted  against  his  former  Ottoman masters and declared himself, with the permission of  the  British,  \u201cSultan  of  the  Arab  Lands\u201d  and \u201cCaliph\u201d over a nationalist \u201ccaliphate\u201d erected by 2 The  word  literarily  means  \u201cthe  noble.\u201d  The  leaders  of  Hij\u0101z  (Makkah,  al-Mad\u012bnah,  and surrounding regions) since 597AH/1200CE up until 1344AH/1925CE all descended from Qat\u0101dah Ibn Idr\u012bs al-Hasan\u012b (died 618AH) and were referred to by the title \u201cshar\u012bf\u201d because of their Hasan\u012b lineage. Because of the later generations\u2019 apostasy through shirk and wal\u0101\u2019 to the apostates and the crusaders, they are not deserving of this praiseworthy title.\n3 Because the names are similar, it should be noted that everywhere the name al-Husayn Ibn \u2018Al\u012b is used here, then it is referring to this crusader agent and not to the noble son of \u2018Al\u012b Ibn Ab\u012b T\u0101lib (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anh).\n\u201cShar\u012bf\u201d al-Husayn - The first in a line of Arab taw\u0101gh\u012bt used and discarded by the crusaders\ndabiq\n\fThe Current Health Infrastructure\nThe  Islamic  State  provides  the  Muslims  with extensive healthcare by running a host of medical facilities including hospitals and clinics in all major cities through which it is offering a wide range of medical services, from various types of complicated surgery to simpler services such as hij\u0101mah. This infrastructure  is  aided  by  a  widespread  network of  pharmacies  run  by  qualified  pharmacists  and managed  under  the  supervision  and  control  of the Health D\u012bw\u0101n.

He was known to seek the correct Islamic rulings in everything he did, and would never knowingly allow any doubts or falsehood to hold firm in his presence.\nOn  watching  the  early  videos  released  by  alFurq\u0101n  Media,  Ab\u016b  Qud\u0101mah  would  always express  his  love  for  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq, even before the announcement of its expansion to Sh\u0101m.\nTowards the end of 2012, Ab\u016b Qud\u0101mah found out that his younger brother Y\u0101s\u012bn had become a shah\u012bd in Afghanistan, and this only drove Ab\u016b Qud\u0101mah to push ever-harder in his battles as he longed for his chance to give his life for Allah.\nBy  Ramad\u0101n,  both  friends  were  fighting  the Nusayriyyah  in  Halab,  and  both  were  injured within a week of each other. Ab\u016b Mu\u2019\u0101wiyah\u2019s gunshot  wound  healed  quickly,  whereas  Ab\u016b Qud\u0101mah  sustained  a  complicated injury to  his  heel.  It  took  six  months  of  intensive physiotherapy  and  treatment  before  he  could use  the  leg  properly  again.  When  his  plaster cast was finally removed he fell to the ground in prayer, prostrating for a long period in thanks to Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101).\nOne  year  later  during  Ramad\u0101n  (2013),  his longtime  companion  and  best  friend,  Ab\u016b Mu\u2019\u0101wiyah,  was  killed  by  a  Nusayr\u012b  sniper  as he  was  trying  to  save  a  fellow  muj\u0101hid,  Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 Al-Jaz\u0101\u2019ir\u012b, who had been wounded in the fighting  while  taking  part  in  operations  in  the town of Salq\u012bn in Idlib. \nHis  shah\u0101dah  could  not  have  been  more enviable: He was fasting, it was during the last 10 days of Ramad\u0101n, on a Thursday \u2013 one of the \nAMONG THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN\nAB\u016a MU\u2019\u0100WIYAH AL-MISR\u012a (RAHIMAHULL\u0100H)\ndays in which a person\u2019s deeds are lifted up to Allah \u2013 and all this in the beloved and blessed land of Sh\u0101m. \nThis affected Ab\u016b Qud\u0101mah. He became quite sad  after  the  death  of  his  best  friend,  not because he missed him, but because he\u2019d lost his friend with whom he had always competed. He began showing an even stronger desire for shah\u0101dah.  \u201cO  Allah  grant  me  shah\u0101dah,\u201d  he would  say  in  du\u2019\u0101\u2019,  encouraging  the  brothers around him to do the same.\nHe was a different man following the death of his friend. He became even more focused, even more robust in his practice of the religion, and he  learned  many  lessons  through  the  battles with the Nusayr\u012b army. By now, almost all of his companions  had  been  killed  in  battle  for  the cause of Allah.\nAb\u016b Qud\u0101mah developed into a sharp fighter who could see where the fighting in Sh\u0101m was \ndabiq\n\fwould  watch  the  videos,  it  would  make  him want  to  perform  hijrah  immediately  and  that would have conflicted with his intent to carry out the operations in France.\nD\u0100BIQ: Do you have a message to the Muslims in general and Muslim sisters in particular?\nUMM BAS\u012aR: Remember {the Day when every soul  will  come  disputing  for  itself,  and  every soul will be fully compensated for what it did, and they will not be wronged} [An-Nahl: 111].\nMy  brothers  and  sisters,  I  call  on  you  to  be concerned about the condition of the Ummah in the world, to act in accordance to such while following the Qur\u2019\u0101n and Sunnah.\nAllah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) gave you minds to think with and intelligence to reason with.

Be advisors to them. They should find comfort and  peace  with  you.  Do  not  make  things difficult  for  them.  Facilitate  all  matters  for them. Be strong and brave. It is essential that you make all your deeds sincerely for Allah\u2019s face and hope for His reward. Know that the Companions  (radiyall\u0101hu  \u2018anhum)  did  not spread Islam in these vast lands except with their  righteous  wives  behind  them.  Do  not waste  your  time  and  energy  in  play,  futility, and  what  does  not  concern  you.  Learn  your religion! Learn your religion! Read the Qur\u2019\u0101n, reflect upon it, and practice it. Nourish your love of Allah and His Messenger. It is essential for you to love Allah and His Messenger more than  your  own  selves,  your  husbands,  your children, and your parents. Follow the example of \u0100siyah \u2013 the wife of Pharaoh \u2013 who left the Duny\u0101  for  Allah  and  the  Hereafter  although she  was  a  queen  and  had  the  wealth  of  the Duny\u0101.  She  was  tortured  and  killed  because of  this  choice,  but  Allah  kept  her  firm  and raised her above many women. And all praise is due to Allah, the Forgiving and Generous. Follow  the  example  of  Maryam  (\u2018alayhassal\u0101m)  in  her  chastity,  modesty,  obedience of Allah, and truthfulness, which was one of her greatest traits, and so Allah chose her and raised her above many women. And all praise is  due  to  Allah,  the  Majestic.  There  were many  righteous  women  in  history,  so  follow their example. Be patient. Patience is a great virtue. May Allah, the Bestower, provide you with patience. The life of the believer is full of trials and tribulations. So be patient while hoping for Allah\u2019s reward. Life is short, even if  it  appears  sometimes  \u2013  during  times  of sorrow \u2013 to be long. By Allah, what awaits us is better and ever-lasting, insh\u0101\u2019all\u0101h.

While its fighters defend and slowly expand IS-held  territory,  other  IS  leaders and  administrators  are  engaged  in bringing  order  and  repairing  social services  and  public  utilities  in  the areas  they  hold,  a  pattern  seen previously in Syria and Iraq.

In this effort, IS has capitalized on what is now a decades  long  campaign,  that  began with  the  USSR\u2019s  demise,  in  which Saudi Arabia, its Gulf partners, and their  NGOs2  have  converted  large numbers  of  Balkans  Muslims  from being  nominal  believers  to  being Muslims  well-schooled  in  the  warprone Salafi and Wahhabi doctrines. The  Saudi-led  effort3  has  not  yet made the Balkans a bastion of those doctrines, but it is yielding increasing numbers  of  Balkan  Muslims  who have  become  Salafis  and  Wahhabis.

And how did it all begin? And what is the history of this \u201cmajlis\u201d with regards to Islam or kufr?\nAbul-Mugh\u012brah:  This  council  consists  of  two  major elements:  \u201cAb\u016b  Sal\u012bm  Martyrs  Brigade\u201d  and  the \u201cLibyan  Islamic  Fighting  Group.\u201d  As  for  the  \u201cLibyan Islamic  Fighting  Group,\u201d  then  its  kufr  is  clear  due  to its  participation  in  the Tar\u0101bulus  government  and  the democratic process under the leadership of Abdelhakim Belhadj. As for the \u201cAb\u016b Sal\u012bm Martyrs Brigade,\u201d then it was a brigade that was once Salaf\u012b. Most of the soldiers of the Islamic State in Darnah were from the brigade\u2019s founders. They abandoned the brigade after it fell into a number of nullifiers of Islam, most infamous of which was its operating as part of the interior ministry in what was known as the \u201csecurity committee.\u201d This is in addition to  their  security  for  the  t\u0101gh\u016bt  Mustafa  Abdul  Jalil, Chairman of the National Transitional Council, when he visited Darnah and called to democracy. Since then, the people of proper methodology abandoned the brigade. They even killed leaders of the brigade who led it to the depths of kufr. All this was before the official expansion of the Islamic State to Libya. After Allah blessed it with \nexpansion to Libya and most of the groups in Darnah pledged  bay\u2019ah  to  it,  the  Ab\u016b  Sal\u012bm  brigade  requested its opponents from the other groups refer to the court of the Islamic State for a resolution. After studying the condition of the brigade and what it fell into, the court of the Islamic State ruled that the brigade had committed apostasy  and  called  its  individuals  to  repentance.  A number of its followers and leaders repented whereas the remaining  gathered  together  with  the  \u201cLibyan  Islamic Fighting Group\u201d to form what they called \u201cMajlis Sh\u016br\u0101 Darnah.\u201d\nD\u0101biq: What is the situation with Ans\u0101r ash-Shar\u012b\u2019ah?\nAbul-Mugh\u012brah:  Many  of  the  leaders  and  soldiers  of Ans\u0101r ash-Shar\u012b\u2019ah were from the first to pledge bay\u2019ah in  Libya  to  the  Islamic  State.  This  group  continues  to have men who wish to implement the Shar\u012b\u2019ah despite the  groups\u2019  abandonment  of  the  lost  obligation  of  the era and its preference of division to unity, most clear in its lack of a bay\u2019ah to the Khal\u012bfah and in its unity with \u201crevolutionary\u201d movements linked to the apostate regime of Tar\u0101bulus in some regions as well as its acceptance in other regions of suspicious aid from filthy hands. It also has contradictory stances from region to region due to the different orientations of its leaders and the alignments of its soldiers. Some of the contradictory stances are also due to the closeness of some of their leaders towards those of \u201cal-Q\u0101\u2019idah in the Islamic Maghrib\u201d present in Libya.\nD\u0101biq: How is the situation in the Libyan wil\u0101y\u0101t with respect to governance?\nAbul-Mugh\u012brah: In Libya, the Islamic State continues to be a young mission as its presence has not completed a full year.

As for what follows:\nIndeed, when the Shar\u012b\u2019ah of our Lord was eliminated, the laws and rulings of the kuff\u0101r gained power in the lands of the Muslims, Islam was shamefully abandoned, and faces turned towards promiscuous Europe, the voice of falsehood rose and with it the voices of those hostile towards the people of the religion, and the cancer of those who legislate besides Allah c ate away at the Ummah\u2019s body. They prohibited what He permitted, and permitted what He prohibited, and one of the most manifest things that they ruined and defamed in defense of women and their rights \u2013 as they claimed  \u2013  was  polygyny.  They  utilized  their  podiums  to that end, including the podiums of the kufr\u012b parliaments and the secular TV channels, and placed on these podiums howling dogs, fools who do not perceive nor know their foolishness. Their poisoned words crept into the hearts of women from the lands of the Muslims, to the point that we almost couldn\u2019t find a single woman that is accepting of this issue, except for those whom Allah protected.\nAllah c said in His clear-cut revelation, {And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then mar-\nry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice]} [An-Nis\u0101\u2019: 3]. This is a verse as clear as the sun that does not require extensive explanation or interpretation. Therefore, O slaves of Allah, you may marry two, three, or four women, unless you fear that you will have shortcomings in your fairness towards them or will fail to fulfill their rights, in which case you suffice with one wife. Ibn Kath\u012br r said, \u201cHis statement {two or three or four} [An-Nis\u0101\u2019: 3] means marry any women  you  wish  apart  from  the  orphans.

And now, unless something changes very quickly and very radically, I await my turn.\nSuch an environment forces the mind to change. I\u2019ve  had  to  become  pretty  tough  inside,  sometimes  just  to  get  through  each  day.  The  Sheikh who originally captured James Foley and me back in November 2012 said, \u201cto go through this you will need a heart of stone.\u201d And he was right. I try to  stay  very  calm,  tolerant  and  accepting  of  my situation. Muslims call it \u2018Qadr Allah,\u2019 the will of God, who determines everything in advance. I am thankful for any comfort I receive and for every plate of food I get.\nIt hasn\u2019t been an easy road, and some of us had a bumpy ride. Once we were finally put into general population with dozens of European prisoners, we had to watch them all go home to their loved ones while we, the British and Americans, were left behind. That was a bitter pill to swallow, but  nothing  compared to what came next. Now I\u2019ve had to watch as James, Steven Sotloff, David Haines and Alan Henning walked out of the door, one every two weeks since August 18th, never to return, knowing they were going to be killed and going to their deaths. \nAnd  now  they\u2019re  gone,  their  faces  and  deaths plastered all over the world\u2019s headlines, four foolish policy victims.\nWhat does that do to a man? After enduring years of pain, darkness and regret, to see it all end in such a  ghastly  way  when  everyone  else  went  home, to  see  ordinary  guys,  family  men,  loving  fathers killed  because  their  governments  wouldn\u2019t  negotiate because of \u2018policy,\u2019 wouldn\u2019t even discuss options for saving them with their families \u2013 can you begin to imagine how that feels? This wasn\u2019t a fateful soul taken at random, it was individuals missing for years in one of the most high-profile hostage crisis seen in modern history, with dozens \nof  witnesses  who  had  gone  home  testifying they were alive and could be helped. I believe even the mujahidin were genuinely surprised at how easily our countries left us for dead. \nWe\u2019d  come  all  this  way,  putting  one  foot  in front  of  the  other,  supporting  one  another when  it  got  tough,  praying  together  every day. We used to call it the Dead Zone when things got bad, after the area Everest climbers face above 26,000 feet as they approach the summit, when every step is agony, when they hardly have enough strength to carry on. We never  gave  up  hope  that  our  nations  would negotiate for our release.\nBut all that time, we never knew that the decision regarding our fate had been made months beforehand in Washington and Whitehall. We never knew that our families, for whom it was like being locked up in prison with us, were being blanked by the governments or being told there  was  nothing  they  could  do.  We  never knew that the families were left to themselves to try anything and everything, while the men in charge folded their arms and offered their sympathies.\ndabiq\f", "schema:headline": "HARD TALK ", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "52"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq9-ISLAMIC-STATE-REPORTS", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "9", "schema:articleBody": "The Current Health Infrastructure\nThe  Islamic  State  provides  the  Muslims  with extensive healthcare by running a host of medical facilities including hospitals and clinics in all major cities through which it is offering a wide range of medical services, from various types of complicated surgery to simpler services such as hij\u0101mah.

Ab\u016b Mu\u2019\u0101wiyah\u2019s gunshot  wound  healed  quickly,  whereas  Ab\u016b Qud\u0101mah  sustained  a  complicated injury to  his  heel.  It  took  six  months  of  intensive physiotherapy  and  treatment  before  he  could use  the  leg  properly  again.  When  his  plaster cast was finally removed he fell to the ground in prayer, prostrating for a long period in thanks to Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101).\nOne  year  later  during  Ramad\u0101n  (2013),  his longtime  companion  and  best  friend,  Ab\u016b Mu\u2019\u0101wiyah,  was  killed  by  a  Nusayr\u012b  sniper  as he  was  trying  to  save  a  fellow  muj\u0101hid,  Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 Al-Jaz\u0101\u2019ir\u012b, who had been wounded in the fighting  while  taking  part  in  operations  in  the town of Salq\u012bn in Idlib. \nHis  shah\u0101dah  could  not  have  been  more enviable: He was fasting, it was during the last 10 days of Ramad\u0101n, on a Thursday \u2013 one of the \nAMONG THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN\nAB\u016a MU\u2019\u0100WIYAH AL-MISR\u012a (RAHIMAHULL\u0100H)\ndays in which a person\u2019s deeds are lifted up to Allah \u2013 and all this in the beloved and blessed land of Sh\u0101m. \nThis affected Ab\u016b Qud\u0101mah. He became quite sad  after  the  death  of  his  best  friend,  not because he missed him, but because he\u2019d lost his friend with whom he had always competed. He began showing an even stronger desire for shah\u0101dah.  \u201cO  Allah  grant  me  shah\u0101dah,\u201d  he would  say  in  du\u2019\u0101\u2019,  encouraging  the  brothers around him to do the same.\nHe was a different man following the death of his friend. He became even more focused, even more robust in his practice of the religion, and he  learned  many  lessons  through  the  battles with the Nusayr\u012b army. By now, almost all of his companions  had  been  killed  in  battle  for  the cause of Allah.\nAb\u016b Qud\u0101mah developed into a sharp fighter who could see where the fighting in Sh\u0101m was \ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "ISLAMIC STATE REPORTS", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "26"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq2-It\u2019s-EithEr-thi-Islamic-State-or-the-flood", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "2", "schema:articleBody": "artIcle\nthe Da\u2019Wah of nuh\npart 2:\nas we are attempting within this article to deal with the root of the issue \u2013 the issue of giving the people choice, we state:\nthe da\u2019wah of prophet n\u016bh (\u2018alayhis-sal\u0101m) followed  a  policy  from  the  very  beginning  that was completely opposed to the methodology of  choice.

In fact, he  entirely  abandoned  the  tone  of  debate  that they  were  accustomed  to,  especially  after  being informed  through  revelation  that  no  one  else from among his people would believe from that day forward apart from those who had already believed.\nFrom amongst the threats he made to his people is that mentioned in the following statement of allah ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101: {and he constructed the ship, and when-\n\fassault began in the morning and included a group of  inghim\u0101siyy\u012bn  plunging  into  the  enemy  ranks, with support from the mortar team, a tank, a BMP, a 23 millimeter gun, and some doshkas.

They then advanced to a position on high ground called  \u201cthe  home  of  Ahmad  Mun\u012br,\u201d  which  overlooks the town of Jar\u0101blus. \nNumerous weapons were captured as ghan\u012bmah, including  assault  rifles,  PKC  machine  guns,  RPG launchers and rounds, a sniper rifle and a night vision scope. During the course of the battle there was one shah\u012bd and a number of light injuries. This battle was just one of a number of successful advances made against the PKK on numerous fronts, including the capture of the village of Kind\u0101r and a  number  of  other  villages  adjacent  to  it  on  the western  front  of  Tal  Abyad  on  the  11th  of  Ramad\u0101n, with the advance continuing towards \u2018Ayn Al-\u2019Arab.

Raise  your  heads  high,  for  today  \u2013  by  Allah\u2019s grace \u2013 you have a state and khil\u0101fah, which will return your dignity, might, rights, and leadership. It  is  a  state  where  the  Arab  and  non-Arab,  the white  man  and  black  man,  the  easterner  and westerner  are  all  brothers.  It  is  a  khil\u0101fah  that gathered  the  Caucasian,  Indian,  Chinese,  Sh\u0101m\u012b, Iraqi, Yemeni, Egyptian, Maghrib\u012b (North African), American, French, German, and Australian. Allah brought  their  hearts  together,  and  thus,  they became brothers by His grace, loving each other for the sake of Allah, standing in a single trench, defending and guarding each other, and sacrificing themselves  for  one  another.  Their  blood  mixed and became one, under a single flag and goal, in one pavilion, enjoying this blessing, the blessing of faithful brotherhood. If kings were to taste this blessing, they would abandon their kingdoms and fight over this grace. All praise and thanks are due to Allah. Therefore, rush O Muslims to your state. Yes, it is your state. Rush, because Syria is not for the Syrians and Iraq is not for the Iraqis. The Earth is Allah\u2019s. {Indeed, the Earth belongs to Allah. He causes to inherit it whom He wills of His servants. And the [best] outcome is for the righteous} [AlA\u2019r\u0101f:  128].  The  State  is  a  state  for  all  Muslims. The  land  is  for  the  Muslims,  all  the  Muslims\u201d [A  Message  to  the  Muj\u0101hid\u012bn  and  the  Muslim Ummah in the Month of Ramad\u0101n].\nNationalism, patriotism, tribalism, and revolutionism were  never  the  driving  forces  inside  the  heart of  the  muwahhid  muj\u0101hid.  For  him  to  lose  his tongue would be more beloved to him than to voluntarily utter slogans of nationalist J\u0101hiliyyah. Rather, the banners of nationalism are beneath his  dusty  feet,  as  they  oppose  Tawh\u012bd  and  the Shar\u012b\u2019ah  and  represent  the  kufr\u012b  and  shirk\u012b ideologies brought to the Muslim world by the two crusaders: Sykes and Picot.\nAmongst  the  greatest  deeds  the  muwahhid performs  is  his  rejection  of  nationalism.  Rather, his  Islam  is  not  correct  until  he  disbelieves  in nationalism, as nationalism declares people equal \n4 FOREWORD\nregardless of their religion, it does not discriminate between them accordingly, it limits the religion to a nationalist border, and it prohibits its expansion beyond.  For  these  reasons,  nationalism  was innovated by the West, as through it, they elevated their  dhimm\u012b  brethren,  empowered  apostasy  in the  Muslims\u2019  lands,  divided  and  conquered  the Muslim  peoples,  and  defended  the  crusaders\u2019 lands from offensive jih\u0101d.\nThe  t\u0101gh\u016bt  Fir\u2019awn  ruled  his  people  through factionalism,  a  predecessor  to  nationalism. {Indeed, Fir\u2019awn exalted himself in the land and made its people into factions, oppressing a sector among them, slaughtering their [newborn] sons and keeping their females alive. Indeed, he was of the corrupters} [Al-Qasas: 4].\nAnd the Muslims were ordered to fight everyone that stands in the way of this religion becoming manifest  over  all  others,  not  to  terminate  its expansion upon reaching national borders. {It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion, even if the mushrik\u012bn despise such} [At-Tawbah: 33]. {And fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah. And if they cease \u2013 then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do} [Al-Anf\u0101l: 39].\nAnd  the  kuff\u0101r  can  never  be  the  equals  of  the Muslims  even  if  both  were  to  come  from  the same land. {Then will We treat the Muslims like the criminals? What is [the matter] with you? How do you judge?} [Al-Qalam: 35-36]. {Or should we treat those who believe and do righteous deeds like  corrupters  in  the  land?  Or  should  We  treat those who fear Allah like the wicked?} [S\u0101d: 28].\nTherefore, pure tawh\u012bd and nationalism can never coexist.\nFinally, nationalism must be disbelieved in so that victory can be achieved for Islam and the Ummah. {Allah  has  promised  those  who  have  believed among you and done righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession [to authority] upon \n\fTHE ALLIES OF AL-Q\u0100\u2019IDAH IN SH\u0100M\nmade you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you} [Al-Hujur\u0101t: 13]. Second, it contradicts the creed of wal\u0101\u2019 and bar\u0101\u2019 \u2013 a great fundamental of the religion \u2013 and uproots it. The Arab Iraqi Christian is their brother who has all rights whereas the Indian  or  Turkish  Muslim  has  no  rights.  The Shar\u012b\u2019ah of these people necessitates preferring \u2018Uqbah  Ibn  Ab\u012b  Mu\u2019ayt  and  Ab\u016b  Jahl  to  Bil\u0101l the  Ethiopian  and  Salm\u0101n  the  Persian.  Third, it  opposes  the  bond  between  the  believers. Ras\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alahyi  wa  sallam)  said, \u2018The  believer  to  the  believer  is  like  a  building, each  part  holding  up  the  other\u2019  [Reported  by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim on the authority of Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 al-Ash\u2019ar\u012b]. He (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) also  said,  \u2018The  example  of  the  believers  with regards to their love, mercy, and sympathy is like that of a single body, if a limb feels pain, the rest of  the  body  responds  to  it  with  sleeplessness and fever\u2019 [Reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim on  the  authority  of  an-Nu\u2019m\u0101n  Ibn  Bash\u012br].  \u2026 Fourth, it is based upon the da\u2019wah to j\u0101hiliyyah and  partisanship.  Allah  (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101)  said,  {When those who disbelieved had put into their hearts hamiyyah \u2013 the hamiyyah of J\u0101hiliyyah} [Al-Fath: 26].  Ras\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam) said, \u2018Whoever calls to \u2018asabiyyah (factionalism) is not one of us\u2019 [Reported by Ab\u016b D\u0101w\u016bd on the authority of Jubayr Ibn Mut\u2019im]\u201d [Adhillah \u2018AlalMu\u2019min\u012bn A\u2019izzah \u2018Alal-K\u0101fir\u012bn].\nAm\u012brul-Mu\u2019min\u012bn  Ab\u016b \u2018Umar  al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (rahimahull\u0101h)  also  said,  \u201cSadly,  some  of  the fledglings of secularism spread the occupation\u2019s lie, formulated a basis for it, argued in favor of it, and raised the banner of blindness in the name of  nationalism  and  patriotism,  both  of  which are exactly what the Magian state constitution entails.  They  made  the  resources  of  Iraq  \u2013 especially  the  water  and  oil  \u2013  the  property  of those who possess Iraqi citizenship! So what if Ras\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  were to migrate to our lands? Indeed, he (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  migrated  to  a  land  other than his and settled in a home other than his. \n8 ARTICLE\nSo  are  those  resources  hal\u0101l  for  him  and  his Companions  in  accordance  with  the  doctrine of  these  people?  No.  As  for  him  (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) and the muh\u0101jir\u012bn after him having authority and leadership, then for that to occur would necessitate facing the harshest of opposition from these people! How not, when these people are those who said, \u2018Iraq is for all the  Iraqis  and  its  resources  are  the  property of all the Iraqis.\u2019 Yes, for all of the Iraqis, even if they are from the Yaz\u012bd\u012b devil worshippers or Sabian  Mandaeans.  All  of  them  according  to them  have  equal  rights  whether  he  is  a  Sunn\u012b Muslim or R\u0101fid\u012b Magian! It does not concern him whether this Iraqi worships our Glorious Lord or a rebellious devil. His right will be protected! O muwahhid\u012bn, our creed is that a Muslim is our brother  even  if  he  is  a  Filipino  Asian  and  that the devil worshipper is our enemy even if he is definitely Iraqi\u201d [Fa\u2019ammaz-Zabadu Fayadhhabu Juf\u0101\u2019\u0101].\nOn \u201c25 December 2014,\u201d the Sh\u0101miyyah Front was  announced  in  Aleppo.

Most of these factions are members of the nationalist Syrian Revolutionary Command Council. All these factions receive supposedly \u201cunconditional\u201d aid from either the Gulf regimes, the CIA, the Syrian National Coalition, or the Free Syrian Army (FSA) Supreme Military Council while \u201cnot belonging\u201d to  any  of  them.

Frankly, all of us have a responsibility to try and confront this  radicalization,  and  make  sure  we  stop young people being drawn into this poisonous, fanatical death cult that a very small minority of people have created.\u201d\nWow.\nTHE CRUSADER ERIC PICKLES\n\u201cBritish values are Muslim values,\u201d he blurted, clearly having no idea what he was talking about, before hastily adding that Islam\u2019s \u201cmessage of peace and unity\u201d makes the country better and stronger.\nWhat we have here are two people, politicians with a tremendous amount of power, who do not  have  the  slightest  idea  what  they\u2019re  on about.

After my shift was over, I rushed to speak about it with another murabit, Abul-Muthanna as-Sumali2  \uf08a.  For  several  months  together,  we  had both been in the ranks of the Islamic State, then operating in the Levant under the name \u201cJabhat an-Nusrah.\u201d I told him about the experience with the cat and he smiled, appreciating Allah\u2019s signs in His creation. \n2  Abul-Muthanna  as-Sumali  (Ali  Dirie)  was  a  man  of  great character and worship. After being imprisoned by the Crusaders for seven years, he was able to flee Canada despite being banned from  travel.  He  planned,  strove,  and  relied upon Allah alone, until he arrived in the Levant. When I first met him, he would regularly read from the same mushaf that had accompanied him in his Canadian prison cell. Upon the official expansion of the Islamic State to the Levant, he rushed to revive the Muslim Jama\u2019ah through his bay\u2019ah. He was not affected by the doubts of the jihad claimants and remained firm upon his covenant. Several weeks later, he had a dream in which the Hur (the maidens of Paradise) gave him glad tidings of martyrdom on a specific date (one which I have forgotten). A week before his martyrdom, several of our friends decided to go shopping for new military attire. He told them he wouldn\u2019t be going with them, because he was expecting martyrdom soon, and narrated to them his dream. When that day arrived, it happened that all Islamic State soldiers were placed on alert due to sudden advances of the Nusayri army and their Rafidi allies on the frontlines near Kafar Hamrah (in the  northern  Aleppo  countryside).  Abul-Muthanna  rushed  to battle and advanced in the direction of the enemy, fighting, until he was severely wounded, bleeding until he surrendered his soul to his Lord. Due to the intensity of enemy fire, it was not possible to extract his body from the forward position he had reached. May Allah accept him and add the blessing of caliphate we enjoy today to the scroll of his good deeds and that of all other martyrs.\nThe conversation led us to reflect more upon others of Allah\u2019s signs, even expressing our good assumptions on the revival of the caliphate with the continuation of jihad in the Levant, by Allah\u2019s permission. Abul-Muthanna later went on his ribat shift, observing the same cat and looking out for any potential Nusayri soldiers.I  don\u2019t  remember  now  if  it  was  then  or  sometime shortly before, when I had sat at our base near Aleppo and penned a list of different signs in Allah\u2019s creation to contemplate while on ribat. I later asked Abul-Muthanna if he\u2019d like me to share the list with him. He was very encouraging. So I read to him different  items  on  it  and  he  would  comment  on  how they were undoubtedly from Allah\u2019s many signs manifesting His wisdom, knowledge, greatness, power, and mercy, as well as His constant support for Islam and the Muslims. It was an invigorating conversation of faith, one which was difficult to hold in the West, as the  Muslim  would  find  himself  a  stranger  amongst the herds who had been westernized by the Murtadd Brotherhood.\nHere, I\u2019ll mention briefly some of the signs we had discussed. But before doing so, let me present an example for the atheists and agnostics of the West who will probably read these words, those odd disbelievers who  arrogantly  deny  Allah  and  haughtily  resist  the testimony  of  their  very  own  fitrah  (natural  human disposition), which Allah instilled in them. Allah c said, \u201cAnd it is He who begins creation; then He repeats it, and that would be easier for Him. His is the sublime example in the heavens and earth. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise\u201d (Ar-Rum 27-28). In these verses, Allah c teaches us what the \u201csublime ex-\n\fone speaking on behalf of the Muslims, said, \u201cO king, we were an ignorant people who worshiped idols, ate animal  carcasses,  committed  fornication,  cut  family ties, and harmed our neighbors; and the strong among us would devour the weak.\u201d\n\u201cWe remained this way until Allah sent to us a messenger  from  among  us  whose  lineage,  truthfulness, trustworthiness, and chastity we knew. He called us to the oneness of Allah, ordering us to worship Him and abandon what we and our fathers were worshiping besides Him of stones and idols, and ordered us to be truthful in speech, to render trusts [to whom they are due], to mend family ties, to be good to our neighbors, and to withhold from forbidden matters and unlawful bloodshed, and he forbade upon us fornication, false speech, devouring an orphan\u2019s wealth, and accusing chaste women of fornication. He commanded us to worship Allah alone and not make any partners  for  Him  in  worship  and  ordered  us  with prayer,  zakah  (charity),  and  fasting.  So  we  affirmed his truthfulness and believed in him, and we followed him in what he had brought us of Allah\u2019s religion.\u201d\u201cWe worshiped Allah alone, not making any partners for Him, prohibited what he forbade upon us, and  allowed  what  he  permitted  for  us,  so  our  people became hostile towards us. They tortured us and sought  to  turn  us  away  from  our  religion  through enticement and oppression in order to take us back to worshiping idols instead of Allah the Exalted, and to permitting the wicked things we used to permit. Thus, when they subjugated us, oppressed us, made things difficult for us, and stood between us and our religion, we left for your land. We chose you over others besides you, and we desired your protection and hoped that we would not be wronged in your presence, O king.\u201d\nAshamah asked him, \u201cDo you have anything of that which he has come with from Allah?\u201d Ja\u2019far replied, \u201cYes.\u201d So Ashamah said, \u201cThen read it to me.\u201d So Ja\u2019far read to him from the first section of Surat Maryam. Ashamah wept until his beard became wet and his patriarchs also wept until their books became wet when they heard what Ja\u2019far recited to them. Ashamah then said,  \u201cIndeed,  this  and  what  Jesus  came  with  have come  from  the  same  lamp.\u201d  He  then  told  the  two representatives  from  Quraysh,  \u201cGo,  for  by  Allah  I will not surrender them to you and they will not be harmed.\u201d So they left, and \u2018Amr said to \u2018Abdullah, \u201cBy Allah, tomorrow I will bring to him something from them by which I will uproot their joy.\u201d\nThe next day, \u2018Amr said to Ashamah, \u201cO king, they utter a tremendous statement concerning Jesus Son of Mary.\u201d1 So Ashamah summoned Ja\u2019far and the Muslims with him and asked them what they say about Jesus. Ja\u2019far said, \u201cWe say about him like our prophet g taught us \u2013 that he is the slave of Allah, His messenger, His [chosen] spirit, and His word which He cast into the pure virgin Mary.\u201d Ashamah then picked up a cane and said, \u201cBy Allah, Jesus Son of Mary does not exceed what you have mentioned so much as the length of this cane.\u201d His patriarchs then snorted, so he said to them, \u201cBy Allah, even if you snort!\u201d (Sirat Ibn Hisham).\nYears later, when the letter of the Prophet g reached him,  he  readily  declared  his  testimony  of  faith,  responding to the Prophet g with the following words:\u201cIn the Name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful. To Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, from Negus Ashamah: May Allah\u2019s peace be upon you, O Prophet of Allah, as well as His mercy and blessings; there is no god but Allah.\u201d\n\u201cAs for what follows: Your letter has reached me, O Messenger of Allah, including what you mentioned of the matter of Jesus. By the Lord of the heavens and the  earth,  Jesus  is  not  more  than  what  you  say.  Indeed, he is as you have stated. We have learned that with  which  you  have  been  sent  to  us,  and  we  have hosted your cousin and his companions. Thus, I bear witness, with truth and affirmation, that you are the Messenger of Allah, and I pledge allegiance to you. I have pledged allegiance to your cousin and, at his hands, have submitted to Allah, the Lord of creation\u201d (Zad  al-Ma\u2019ad).\nThus, after having been entrusted with the care and protection of the noble family and companions of the Prophet g, Ashamah\u2019s relationship with Allah\u2019s Messenger g took on a new turn. By embracing Islam, he had effectively nullified his loyalty to the disbelievers and grasped the firm handhold of Islam, making it the only scale that would define his relationship with others. This became manifest when he cut off his ties to the Byzantine emperor, Heraclius, by cancelling the tribute he used to pay to him. Ibnul-Qayyim mentions that when the Prophet g sent \u2018Amr Ibn al-\u2018As to the two kings of Oman with his letter calling them \n1  Here, \u2018Amr was referring to the fact that the Prophet g and his companions declared that Jesus was not the son of Allah as was falsely claimed by Christians after the distortion of their religion.\n\f", "schema:headline": "Contemplate the Creation", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "8"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq12-PARADIGM-SHIFT-PART-II---BY-JOHN-CANTLIE", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "12", "schema:articleBody": "\u201c15 months after the declaration of the Caliphate, the US-led campaign against it is more diffused than ever, and there are many now in the West who are conceding that the Islamic State is a country that is here to stay.\u201d\nOn 31st March, issue 8 of D\u0101biq magazine published an article I wrote called \u201cParadigm Shift,\u201d in which I examined the depiction of the Islamic State in Western media and  politics  progressing  from  a  mere  \u201corganization\u201d  to a real, functioning entity. A country, I called it. I know nothing about nation building. I\u2019m so foolish I never even made it to university. But after dismissing some of the things I\u2019ve written in the past as \u201cISIS propaganda,\u201d many journalists and scholars in the West are now agreeing with this sentiment. The Islamic State, they say, is a genuine state.\nThis reality of the Caliphate is confirmed by many things, the people living under its governance, for one. For the first time in years, Muslims are living in security and their businesses  are  doing  a  roaring  trade.  The  zak\u0101h  system has been up and running, taking a percentage of peoples\u2019 wealth and dispersing it to the poor. The gold dinar coins \nfirst mentioned a year ago are now being minted, in preparation for their circulation. Shar\u012b\u2019ah courts are established in every city and are judging by the laws of Islam. Corruption, before an unavoidable fact of life in both Iraq and Syria, has been cut to virtually nil while crime rates have considerably tumbled.\nMeanwhile the Gulf states all around are in turmoil. They are  broken  by  religious  differences  and  fractured  by  ancient tribal feuds. The \u201cMiddle East \u2026 is broken, angry and so dysfunctional that it\u2019s in a class all by itself, giving new meaning to the word \u2018hopeless,\u2019\u201d wrote scholar Aaron David Miller in Foreign Policy on 11th September. \u201cIt is so torn apart and riven with sectarian, political, and religious hatreds and confrontations that it seems beyond the capacity of any external party to remedy.\u201d It\u2019s precisely for reasons like this that the Islamic State has arisen so fast and in such a short space of time. There is only one sect here, Sunni Islam, and the Caliph can only be from one tribe, Quraysh. Here in the Caliphate, there is no room for pluralism.\nIn an article published in The Telegraph on 8th June, Ruth Sherlock wrote, \u201cThe jihadists have become fastidious bu-\n4747\nPARADIGM SHIFT: PART II\n\fOn 25 Dhul-Qa\u2019dah 1436, Ab\u016b Fir\u0101s as-S\u016br\u012b \u2013 formerly official spokesman of the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front, currently a Jawl\u0101n\u012b front leader and head of its \u201cshar\u2019\u012b academies\u201d \u2013 published an article exposing the deviance of the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front\u2019s allies and consequently his own deviance and that of his party.

They call them the other face of the Khaw\u0101rij state and a party of deviance and terror, whereas they are more worthy of the description of deviance and farther from the truth and truthfulness. 15) They declare their bar\u0101\u2019ah from Salaf\u012b Jihadism. 16)  They  describe  the  muj\u0101hid\u012bn  as  Khaw\u0101rij,  extremists, and  corrupters.

This  week,  its  forces  were finally  driven  out  of  the  Syrian  Kurdish  town of  Kobani  after  a  siege  lasting  134  days,  in which it suffered heavy losses from 606 US air strikes.  But  elsewhere  in  Syria,  Isis  has  been advancing towards the city of Homs as well as gaining strength south of Damascus and at alQalamoun,  close  to  eastern  Lebanon.  By  one account, Isis has won control of territory since last September where one million Syrians live, in addition to the area it already held.\u201d\n\u201cIn Iraq, government forces have made advances in  the  provinces  around  Baghdad,  but  earlier this  week  bullets  hit  a  plane  and  wounded passengers over Baghdad International Airport, forcing major airlines to stop flying there.

Isis has also conscripted fighters in the territories it controls.\u201d\n\u201cIsis is being squeezed militarily and economically, but there is no sign of it imploding.

President Obama says America\u2019s main effort is in Iraq but unless it can rebuild the Iraqi army then  it  will  be  near  impossible  to  defeat  Isis there. And so long as Isis continues, so too will high profile hostage-taking and executions.\u201d\nThe  Washington  Post  Editorial  Board  also commented on the \u201cvictories\u201d of the coalition, saying:\n\u201cA small victory in Syria is no reason to celebrate as the Islamic State gets stronger. US officials are celebrating a modest victory in the war against the  Islamic  State  in  Syria  \u2013  the  apparently successful  defense  of  the  Kurdish  town  of Kobane, on the border with Turkey. Under siege since early October, Kobane has little strategic value but came to be seen as a test of whether the United States and its allies could stop the expansion of the Islamic State \u2026 With the help of  Kurdish  ground  forces,  the  extremists  were turned  back.  But  perhaps  the  most  significant fact about Kobane is that it consumed 75 percent of  the  nearly  1,000  airstrikes  carried  out  by allied planes throughout Syria since September \u2026 In the rest of the Syrian territory it controls, including its capital of Raqqa, the Islamic State \u2026 is growing stronger rather than weaker.\u201d\nOr in the words of the crusader Eric Shawn of Fox News:\n\u201cThe president promises ISIS will be destroyed. Instead, it is only spreading \u2026 Coalition forces did  finally  beat  back  ISIS  in  the  key  border town of Kobani \u2026 It reportedly took 75 percent of  all  the  air  strikes  launched  there  so  far  to accomplish it. And despite that one glimmer of hope,  the  Islamic  state  vows  to  recapture  the town  as  it  scores  successes  elsewhere  \u2026  The Islamic state\u2019s territory has grown in the last five months \u2026 despite all of the coalition air strikes.\u201d\ndabiq\n\fBut the fiery zeal of the broken Muslim Ummah began  to  cool  by  the  hazy  events  known  as \u201cthe  Arab  Spring\u201d  as  well  as  the  lack  of  a body  representing  Islam  (the  Khil\u0101fah)  then. The  Muslims  saw  the  same  aforementioned movements,  \u201cscholars,\u201d  callers,  sects,  and even  the  apostate  taw\u0101gh\u012bt3    get  involved in  \u201csupporting\u201d  the  cause  of  the  oppressed Muslims  in  Sh\u0101m.  And  so  confusion  spread, and the withering of the grayzone was slowed or  almost  halted.  Once  again,  the  heretical call  to  the  gates  of  Hellfire  \u2013  the  religions  of the  taw\u0101gh\u012bt  \u2013  was  answered  by  many  of  the ignorant.\nThen  came  the  announcement  of  the  Islamic State\u2019s  expansion  to  Sh\u0101m  followed  by  the subsequent  announcement  of  the  Khil\u0101fah\u2026 bringing the grayzone to the brink of permanent extinction\u2026  by  reviving  the  great  body  of Islam and so no Muslim had any excuse to be independent of this entity embodying them and waging war on their behalf in the face of kufr. Now, a stance of \u201cneutrality\u201d or \u201cindependence\u201d would doom him4 , as it entailed major sin, which would  cause  him  to  commit  greater  sins  until he could commit kufr for the sake of his sinful interests,  as  the  scholars  stated,  \u201cThe  reward for sin is another sin,\u201d and \u201cSins are the gateway to kufr\u201d [Al-Jaw\u0101b al-K\u0101f\u012b \u2013 Ibnul-Qayyim].5\nThe destruction of the grayzone is comparable to  the  division  resulting  from  the  Islamic message  when  it  was  first  conveyed  by  the Messenger  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam).  As the angels said when they appeared before the Prophet (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) while he was  sleeping,  \u201cMuhammad  is  a  divider\u201d  and \u201cMuhammad  divided  the  people\u201d  [Sah\u012bh  alBukh\u0101r\u012b]. For this reason, the mushrik\u012bn would warn the Arabs against the Prophet (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) by saying, \u201cYou have come to our lands. The matter of this man amongst us has grown severe. He has divided our jam\u0101\u2019ah (community)  and  scattered  our  strength.  His words  are  like  that  of  a  sorcerer.  He  divides between a man and his father, a man and his \nTHE EXTINCTION OF THE GRAYZONE\nbrother, a man and his wife. We fear for you and your people what he has brought upon us. So do not speak to him nor listen to a word from him\u201d  [Ibn  Hish\u0101m].  They  would  also  say,  \u201cHe divides between a man and his religion \u2026 a man and his clan\u201d [Ibn Hish\u0101m] and \u201cHe severed the bonds between us\u201d [Ibn Hish\u0101m].\nRas\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  came with al-Furq\u0101n (the Qur\u2019\u0101n, the divider between truth  and  falsehood)  by  which  he  divided  his people into two opposing parties \u2013 the Muslims versus  the  mushrik\u012bn  \u2013  who  then  fought  each other  on  the  Day  of  al-Furq\u0101n  (the  Battle  of Badr),  where  Ras\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa sallam) slaughtered his mushrik adversaries by his sword.\nAnd  when  a  grayzone  formed  and  a  \u201cmasjid\u201d was  established  for  it,  Allah  (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101)  revealed to His Messenger (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) al-F\u0101dihah  (the  Exposer,  S\u016brat  at-Tawbah)  by which the grayish were exposed as well as their harmful  \u201cmasjid.\u201d  Ras\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi wa sallam) went on to demolish this \u201cmasjid\u201d\u2026 again ridding the Ummah of the destructive gray movement, as the grayzone was the hideout of the  hypocrites,  {Indeed,  the  hypocrites  [think to]  deceive  Allah,  but  He  is  deceiving  them. And  when  they  stand  for  prayer,  they  stand lazily, showing [themselves to] the people and not remembering Allah except a little, wavering between  them,  [belonging]  neither  to  the _____________3   See previous footnote.\n4   Note: After September 11th, the two opposing camps were the divided Ummah versus the crusaders. Now \u2013 according to the crusaders themselves \u2013 it is the Islamic State versus the crusaders. Accordingly, the grayzone has different implications for both times. In the past, it consisted of the hypocrites, deviant innovators, and abandoners of jih\u0101d. After the Khil\u0101fah and the subsequent crusade, the grayzone also encompasses \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201cneutral\u201d Islamic parties that refuse to join the Khil\u0101fah, as these parties claim to be independent of both opposing camps.\n5   What the scholars mean is that sins \u2013 including bid\u2019ah \u2013 will get a person into committing further sins. Each time he commits a sin, Allah will punish him with greater sins. Eventually, Allah could punish him with kufr, like the case of someone who knows that the implementation of the Shar\u012b\u2019ah will prevent him from pursuing his addiction to sin and thus joins the ranks of those who wage war against it, so he can preserve a social and political condition suitable for his sins. Or the case of those whose attachment to innovation and hizbiyyah is so deep that he feels he must wage war against the Khil\u0101fah and so he cooperates with the murtadd\u012bn against it.\ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "IN THE WORDS OF THE ENEMY", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "52"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq12-MILITARY-OPERATIONS-BY-THE-ISLAMIC-STATE", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "12", "schema:articleBody": "A SELECTION OF MILITARY OPERATIONS\n BY THE ISLAMIC STATE\nAs the soldiers of the Khil\u0101fah continue waging war on the forces of kufr, we take a glimpse at a number of recent operations conducted by the muj\u0101hid\u012bn of the Islamic State that have succeeded in expanding the territory of the Khil\u0101fah or terrorizing, massacring, and humiliating the enemies of Allah. These operations are merely a selection of the numerous operations that the Islamic State has conducted on various fronts across many regions over the course of the last two months.\nWil\u0101yat  al-Khayr  -  On  Wednesday  the  25th  of  DhulQa\u2019dah, the soldiers of the Khil\u0101fah carried out an assault on  the  forward  defense  position  for  the  missile  battalion base  at  the  Dayr  az-Zawr  military  airbase  and  succeeded in taking control of the position.

They targeted two groups of Nusayr\u012b soldiers inside the battalion base, and their attacks were followed by an assault in which the muj\u0101hid\u012bn succeeded in taking complete control of the base and capturing a large quantity  of  ghan\u012bmah.  One  month  later,  the  muj\u0101hid\u012bn would score another major victory in their ongoing efforts to capture the Dayr az-Zawr airbase.

He detonated his explosive vehicle, destroying the headquarters,  killing  nearly  30  murtadd\u012bn,  and  wounding  several others.

Just five days later, they struck again, targeting Kunio Hoshi, a citizen of Japan, one of the member nations  of  the  crusader  coalition.  He  was  closely  tracked and eliminated in the city of Rangpur using a firearm. Just three weeks later, on the 10th of Muharram, the muj\u0101hid\u012bn detonated a number of IEDs on the D\u0101l\u0101n temple in the city of Dhaka as the R\u0101fidah were conducting their shirk\u012b rituals, killing and wounding nearly 100 of them. Eleven days later, the muj\u0101hid\u012bn assaulted a checkpoint in Dhaka, killing one policeman and wounding another.\nWil\u0101yat  \u2018Adan  Abyan  -  On  Tuesday  the  22nd  of  DhulHijjah,  four  istishh\u0101d\u012b  operations  targeted  a  gathering  of Saudi, Emirati, and Yemeni officers and pounded the Yemeni government\u2019s headquarters. The first was carried out by our brother Ab\u016b Sa\u2019d al-\u2018Adan\u012b, who detonated his explosive truck at the Palace Hotel, which served as the government\u2019s headquarters.  He  was  followed  by  the  second  istishh\u0101d\u012b, Ab\u016b  Muhammad  as-Sahl\u012b,  who  detonated  his  explosive Hummer at the same location, killing the murtadd soldiers present there.

In such a scenario, the blessed ones are often those who are able to survive with their \u012bm\u0101n intact and a mountain of sins to answer for on the Day of Judgment. But even in the case of those who eventually make the decision to leave such lands and perform hijrah to d\u0101rul-Isl\u0101m after Allah guides them and opens their eyes to the dangerous situation they are in, it\u2019s often too late for their family. For many, the decision to save themselves comes after they\u2019ve already lost their children, some to drugs and promiscuity, and others to kufr, shirk, and even atheism. And it all begins in the schools.\nMany of those who send their children to the schools of the kuff\u0101r are \u201cuneducated\u201d1 and thereby unable to teach their children themselves, so they rely on others to teach them. Many others are in financial need, so they don\u2019t have the money to hire a Muslim tutor that can teach  their  children  without  incorporating  un-Islamic \n1 This is a term used to refer exclusively to secular \u201ceducation.\u201d Many people have been duped into believing that a secular \u201ceducation\u201d is a \u201cnecessity,\u201d so much so that they consider it a child\u2019s essential \u201cright\u201d to waste dozens of years in school to obtain a piece of paper that may ultimately have nothing to do with the profession he later works in!

She told me that she claimed we were all doing well \u2013 and in the Duny\u0101 sense we were in fact doing fairly well \u2013 when in reality, as my mother said, \u201cEvery family that comes here suffers one calamity or another with respect to their children.\u201d What she was referring to, as she went on to clarify, were the countless Muslim youth in the West who get themselves tangled into drugs, alcohol, gangs, promiscuity, and other vices and social illnesses over which any decent Muslim family would weep for its children.\nAnd  yet  as  terrible  as  these  vices  may  be,  the  fact  remains that many still downplay the severity of kufr in comparison with other sins.

And I think that on the day he came forward to marry you, if he was not a muj\u0101hid then, he was a muj\u0101hid in the making. At the very least, you were aware of his methodology and creed, and you knew what type of life he sought to live. And if he was a deviant sitting back from jih\u0101d at the time, he has repented to Allah, and Allah is more joyed by the repentance of His slave than  a  man  who  wakes  up  and  finds  his  camel  next to him after losing it in the desert! So why do we find some of the muj\u0101hid\u012bn\u2019s wives complaining about their lives? If she hears of an imminent battle that he will be in, she gets angry. If she sees him putting on war armor, she gets upset. If he goes out for rib\u0101t, she gets in a bad mood.  If  he  returns  late,  she  complains.  O  my  sister, who deluded you and told you that the life of jih\u0101d is one of comfort and ease? Do you not love jih\u0101d and its people? Please listen.

You are in jih\u0101d when you uphold your loyalty to him in his absence. You are in jih\u0101d when you teach his children the difference between  the  truth  and  falsehood,  between  right  and wrong. Indeed, you, my precious sister, are today the wife of a muj\u0101hid, and tomorrow you might be the wife of a shah\u012bd, or an injured fighter, or a prisoner \u2013 so how ready is your supply of patience and steadfastness?

Yet, out of Allah\u2019s mercy, He did  not  impose  upon  our  Ummah such a difficult act of atonement for shirk  as  He  did  for  Ban\u012b  Isr\u0101\u2019\u012bl,  but instead only requires that those who fall into shirk abandon the act of shirk they committed and repent sincerely.Furthermore, by stating that only a  few  of  the  hypocrites  would  obey Him if He were to command them to kill themselves or to perform hijrah, Allah  is  exposing  the  nature  of  the hypocrites who merely pay lip service to the religion without actually having obedience to their Lord. As such, if  they  were  to  be  faced  with  commands that entail a tremendous level of difficulty and sacrifice, they would make  excuses  for  themselves  rather than follow the clear revelation. This reinforces the point that the true slave of Allah is one who neither questions the  wisdom  in  His  commands  nor hesitates to carry them out, regardless of how difficult they may appear. It\u2019s important to note that many of those who  claim  to  follow  Allah  and  His Messenger find it difficult to perform deeds \u2013 whether hijrah or otherwise \u2013  purely  out  of  obedience  to  Allah and His Messenger. They claim that they must know the wisdom related to the deed \u2013 and undoubtedly there is wisdom in all Allah\u2019s decrees \u2013 but if they can\u2019t see it, or if they believe that  this  wisdom  no  longer  applies to the modern era or to their society, they neglect the deed, discourage and mock those who perform it, and even wage  war  against  the  Book  of  Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, all the while still claiming to be Muslims!Those who do this are of varying levels. There are those who are more blatant  in  this  regard  and  have  no shame in declaring that the Shar\u012b\u2019ah is  \u201cbarbaric,\u201d  or  is  inapplicable  in our  times,  and  there  are  those  who are  more  discreet,  including  many \nwho reside in the lands of kufr, refuse to perform hijrah, and make all manner of excuses in order to avoid such a lofty obligation. This, however,  is  not  surprising  when one considers that the sacrifice and difficulty entailed in making hijrah is so great that Allah c mentioned it  in  the  above  \u0101yah  alongside the order to kill oneself! Even the Prophets p were not exempt from the  difficulty  involved  in  making hijrah, including the best of mankind g, who made hijrah to a city whose  population  included  some treacherous  Jews  and  hypocrites and  was  surrounded  by  hostile Bedouin  tribes  after  first  leaving the protection of his own tribe and relatives, facing an assassination attempt, and seeking shelter in a cave for a number of days. Performing hijrah is often a serious test of one\u2019s \u012bm\u0101n and tawakkul, and as such, it requires a believer to prepare himself by ensuring that he is ready to carry out the commands of Allah with nothing more than a simple order,  even  if  he  doesn\u2019t  understand  the  whole  wisdom  behind it. Allah c says, {But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not} [Al-Baqarah: 216].\nnarration \nAlso,  one  can  take  from  the aforementioned of Th\u0101bit  Ibn  Qays  that  a  believer must  demonstrate  confidence  in his  willingness  to  obey  Allah  and His  Messenger  in  the  most  difficult  of  circumstances  and  not second-guess  himself,  even  when facing  a  hypothetical  scenario. Doing so does not constitute tazkiyat (self-promotion) when accompanied with a correct intention, such as for the purpose of  displaying  honor  and  strength in front of the kuff\u0101r, as was done by Th\u0101bit h in front of the Jew, or for the purpose of inciting oneself towards the obedience of Allah \nan-nafs \nand His Messenger, and this is of even greater significance, for in the aforementioned \u0101y\u0101t, Allah c says, {And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger \u2013 those will be with the ones  upon  whom  Allah  has  bestowed favor} [An-Nis\u0101\u2019: 69], and in  the  \u0101y\u0101t  preceding  this,  Allah c says, {And We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by permission  of  Allah}  [An-Nis\u0101\u2019: 64]. So the believer must be conscious of his level of obedience to Allah and His Messenger, and incite  himself  in  that  regard.\nConcerning  the  words  of  Allah,  {But  if  they  had  done  what they were instructed, it would have been better for them and a firmer position [for them in faith]} [AnNis\u0101\u2019: 66], at-Tabar\u012b mentions that as-Sudd\u012b  explained  \u201ca  firmer  position\u201d to mean \u201ca stronger tasd\u012bq (affirmation  of  the  truth).\u201d  This is appropriate, for indeed one can affirm the truth of Islam with his words, but if this is not backed by lofty deeds such as hijrah then it is often  merely  lip  service,  as  mentioned earlier concerning the hypocrites. As such, Allah is teaching us  that  by  performing  the  deeds we\u2019ve been instructed to do \u2013 particularly the difficult ones that require  a  greater  level  of  obedience and  sacrifice  \u2013  the  Muslim  lends more strength to his claim that he is a believer. As a result, Allah c grants him two tremendous favors, as  mentioned  in  the  two  subsequent \u0101y\u0101t: {And then We would have given them from Us a great reward. And We would have guided  them  to  a  straight  path}  [AnNis\u0101\u2019:  67-68].\nMay  Allah  make  us \nfrom among those who do not shy away from  performing  difficult  deeds that  bring  us  guidance  and  adherence to the straight path in the Duny\u0101  followed  by  tremendous rewards  in  the  Hereafter.\n19\flonel  Mashk\u016br  al-Jughayf\u012b, in addition to one of the leaders of the  sahwah  groups.

These  clans  were left armed after they agreed to submit to the rule of the Shar\u012b\u2019ah with the condition they hand over all heavy weaponry. They then betrayed their covenant by rebelling against the Islamic State. They ambushed Islamic  State  soldiers,  and  then  tortured, amputated, and executed prisoners taken from the ambushes. All these crimes were carried  out  in  opposition  to  the  enforcement of the Shar\u012b\u2019ah.\nThereafter  the  Islamic  State  surrounded  their  villages  and  ordered  them  to hand over the perpetuators of the crimes against  Islam  and  the  Muslims.

Otherwise, his claims will become a greater proof against him on Judgment \nDay. \nAs  for  the  Muslim students  who  use this  same  pretense now to  continue abandoning the obligation  of  the  era, then  they  should know  that  their  hijrah  from  d\u0101rul-kufr to  d\u0101rul-Isl\u0101m and  jih\u0101d  are  more obligatory  and  urgent then spending an  unknown  number  of  years  studying  while  exposed to  doubts  and  desires  that  will  destroy  their  religion  and  thus end for themselves any possible future of jih\u0101d.\nTHe Fear oF Hypocrisy\nparT 2:\nAb\u016b Hurayrah (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anh) said that Allah\u2019s Messenger  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  said, \u201cWhoever  dies  without  taking  part  in  a  battle and  without  intending  to  take  part  in  a  battle, has died with a trait of hypocrisy\u201d [Sah\u012bh Muslim]. Therefore, abandoning jih\u0101d is a trait of hypocrisy. So be wary of it or else it may seize you by your heart.\nAl-Hasan  al-Basr\u012b  (rahimahull\u0101h)  said,  \u201cNo  one fears  hypocrisy  except  a  believer,  and  no  one feels safe from it except a hypocrite\u201d [J\u0101mi\u2019 al-\u2018Ul\u016bm wal-Hikam].\nIbn  Rajab  (rahimahull\u0101h)  said,  \u201cSahl  at-Tustar\u012b said, \u2018The mur\u012bd (devout worshipper) fears being afflicted with sins, but the \u2018\u0101rif (knowledgeable  slave)  fears  being  afflicted  with  kufr.\u2019  For this reason the Sah\u0101bah and the righteous Salaf after them were afraid of nif\u0101q (hypocrisy) for themselves,  and  their  worry  of  nif\u0101q  was  severe. Therefore, the believer is afraid of minor nif\u0101q for himself, and he is afraid that such could overcome him prior to death and thus drive him into major nif\u0101q, as we mentioned before that deeply  hidden  evils  bring  about  sinful  death\u201d [J\u0101mi\u2019 al-\u2018Ul\u016bm wal-Hikam].\ndabiq\f", "schema:headline": "Islamic state reports ", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "12"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq7-THE-EXTINCTION-OF-THE-GRAYZONE", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "But the fiery zeal of the broken Muslim Ummah began  to  cool  by  the  hazy  events  known  as \u201cthe  Arab  Spring\u201d  as  well  as  the  lack  of  a body  representing  Islam  (the  Khil\u0101fah)  then.

Once  again,  the  heretical call  to  the  gates  of  Hellfire  \u2013  the  religions  of the  taw\u0101gh\u012bt  \u2013  was  answered  by  many  of  the ignorant.\nThen  came  the  announcement  of  the  Islamic State\u2019s  expansion  to  Sh\u0101m  followed  by  the subsequent  announcement  of  the  Khil\u0101fah\u2026 bringing the grayzone to the brink of permanent extinction\u2026  by  reviving  the  great  body  of Islam and so no Muslim had any excuse to be independent of this entity embodying them and waging war on their behalf in the face of kufr. Now, a stance of \u201cneutrality\u201d or \u201cindependence\u201d would doom him4 , as it entailed major sin, which would  cause  him  to  commit  greater  sins  until he could commit kufr for the sake of his sinful interests,  as  the  scholars  stated,  \u201cThe  reward for sin is another sin,\u201d and \u201cSins are the gateway to kufr\u201d [Al-Jaw\u0101b al-K\u0101f\u012b \u2013 Ibnul-Qayyim].5\nThe destruction of the grayzone is comparable to  the  division  resulting  from  the  Islamic message  when  it  was  first  conveyed  by  the Messenger  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam).  As the angels said when they appeared before the Prophet (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) while he was  sleeping,  \u201cMuhammad  is  a  divider\u201d  and \u201cMuhammad  divided  the  people\u201d  [Sah\u012bh  alBukh\u0101r\u012b]. For this reason, the mushrik\u012bn would warn the Arabs against the Prophet (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) by saying, \u201cYou have come to our lands. The matter of this man amongst us has grown severe. He has divided our jam\u0101\u2019ah (community)  and  scattered  our  strength.  His words  are  like  that  of  a  sorcerer.  He  divides between a man and his father, a man and his \nTHE EXTINCTION OF THE GRAYZONE\nbrother, a man and his wife. We fear for you and your people what he has brought upon us. So do not speak to him nor listen to a word from him\u201d  [Ibn  Hish\u0101m].  They  would  also  say,  \u201cHe divides between a man and his religion \u2026 a man and his clan\u201d [Ibn Hish\u0101m] and \u201cHe severed the bonds between us\u201d [Ibn Hish\u0101m].\nRas\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  came with al-Furq\u0101n (the Qur\u2019\u0101n, the divider between truth  and  falsehood)  by  which  he  divided  his people into two opposing parties \u2013 the Muslims versus  the  mushrik\u012bn  \u2013  who  then  fought  each other  on  the  Day  of  al-Furq\u0101n  (the  Battle  of Badr),  where  Ras\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa sallam) slaughtered his mushrik adversaries by his sword.\nAnd  when  a  grayzone  formed  and  a  \u201cmasjid\u201d was  established  for  it,  Allah  (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101)  revealed to His Messenger (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) al-F\u0101dihah  (the  Exposer,  S\u016brat  at-Tawbah)  by which the grayish were exposed as well as their harmful  \u201cmasjid.\u201d  Ras\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi wa sallam) went on to demolish this \u201cmasjid\u201d\u2026 again ridding the Ummah of the destructive gray movement, as the grayzone was the hideout of the  hypocrites,  {Indeed,  the  hypocrites  [think to]  deceive  Allah,  but  He  is  deceiving  them.

Now \u2013 according to the crusaders themselves \u2013 it is the Islamic State versus the crusaders. Accordingly, the grayzone has different implications for both times. In the past, it consisted of the hypocrites, deviant innovators, and abandoners of jih\u0101d. After the Khil\u0101fah and the subsequent crusade, the grayzone also encompasses \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201cneutral\u201d Islamic parties that refuse to join the Khil\u0101fah, as these parties claim to be independent of both opposing camps.\n5   What the scholars mean is that sins \u2013 including bid\u2019ah \u2013 will get a person into committing further sins. Each time he commits a sin, Allah will punish him with greater sins. Eventually, Allah could punish him with kufr, like the case of someone who knows that the implementation of the Shar\u012b\u2019ah will prevent him from pursuing his addiction to sin and thus joins the ranks of those who wage war against it, so he can preserve a social and political condition suitable for his sins. Or the case of those whose attachment to innovation and hizbiyyah is so deep that he feels he must wage war against the Khil\u0101fah and so he cooperates with the murtadd\u012bn against it.\ndabiq\n\fHIS ENJOINING OF GOOD AND FORBIDDING OF EVIL\n{And  let  there  be  [arising]  from  you  a  nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and those will be the successful} [\u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 104].\nIn  his  home,  amongst  his  family,  with  the Muslims,  on  the  street,  if  he  saw  an  evil,  he would not leave it be, rather \u2013 with wisdom and humility \u2013 he would enjoin good and forbid evil.\nHIS DA\u2019WAH\n{And  who  is  better  in  speech  than  one  who invites  to  Allah  and  does  righteousness  and says, \u201cIndeed, I am of the Muslims\u201d} [41:33].\nHe called many people to Allah, especially when he was in prison. He met a man in prison who was  originally  Muslim  but  hated  the  religion and everything related to the religion, to the point  that  this  man  prevented  his  wife  from wearing  hij\u0101b  and  would  prevent  his  brother back  home  from  learning  Arabic.  In  prison, this man met the brother Ab\u016b Bas\u012br and stayed with him for 2-3 months. After this period, he would pray all the prayers during their proper time, pray qiy\u0101mul-layl every night, and recite the Qu\u2019r\u0101n daily. He ordered his wife to wear hij\u0101b and ordered her to sell the house that he had  purchased  with  a  usurious  loan  so  as  to get out of har\u0101m. This story is a story from the dozens  of  unexaggerated  stories.  Those  who met the brother Ab\u016b Bas\u012br will weep over his shah\u0101dah. He would also call the people whom he  trusted  to  carry  out  the  order  of  Allah  by pledging  allegiance  to  Am\u012brul-Mu\u2019min\u012bn  Ab\u016b Bakr al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b.\nHIS DHIKR\nYahy\u0101  (\u2018alayhis-sal\u0101m)  said,  \u201cI  order  you  with much dhikr of Allah.

He would recite Qur\u2019\u0101n much. The  best  dhikr  is  the  recitation  of  His  words (subh\u0101nah)  \u2013  the  words  He  revealed  to  His Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam),  as  in the  had\u012bth,  \u201cYou  do  not  return  to  Allah  with something  better  than  what  left  from  Him\u201d [Sah\u012bh: Reported by al-H\u0101kim].\nHIS FOLLOWING OF THE EVIDENCE\n{Follow, [O mankind], what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other than Him any allies.

Its most effective way of establishing itself is not by attacking across the border, but by coopting Jordanian  extremist  factions  and  exploiting  the simmering  social  discontent  among  Jordanian youth. To  counter  these  trends,  the  government has sought to exploit divisions between al-Qaeda and  the  Islamic  State,  releasing  some  clerics  [alMaqdis\u012b and al-Filist\u012bn\u012b] aligned with the former group  and  allowing  them  a  degree  of  media visibility.\u201d\nThis  policy  was  even  suggested  for  Afghanistan and  Pakistan,  as  the  Islamic  State\u2019s  presence there threatened regional stability.

The  US listed the Nusra Front a terrorist organisation in December  2012,  long  before  the  emergence  of IS, but since last year the US-led intervention in Syria and Iraq has largely focused on the aim of degrading and \u2018ultimately destroying\u2019 IS. While coalition  airstrikes  have  also  targeted  Nusra positions, the group is less of a priority for the US-led campaign.\u201d\n\fThe apostate leader of Hamas, Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl Haniyyah, with his ally Khamenei, leader of the R\u0101fidah\nD\u0101biq: When did the siege begin on the Yarm\u016bk Camp and how did it affect the people of the camp?\nYarm\u016bk: All praise belongs to Allah, the Strong, the  Exalted.

As to what follows: O Allah, there is nothing easy except what You made easy and You make  sadness  easy  if  You  will.  O  Allah  bestow us with shah\u0101dah for Your cause purely for Your noble face.\nIn reality, the total siege of South Dimashq began four years ago. An exception to that siege was the Yarm\u016bk  Camp.  The  regime  conspired  with  Free Syrian  Army  leaders  in  the  region  to  keep  the camp open in order to empty the huge storehouses found in the district of \u2018Aqrab\u0101 and Bayt Sahm. These areas were stores for the regime in which it would store staple food supplies like sugar, rice, bulgur, and so on, and it would use the Yarm\u016bk Camp  as  a  passage  to  move  these  food  supplies out of the storehouses.\nThe  regime  worked  according  to  this  evil  plan for about a year, until it was sure the storehouses \nand huge factories were completely emptied and nothing  remained  in  the  area  except  for  scarce quantities sufficing the Muslims for a month or two. The work was completed under the gaze of Akn\u0101f  Bayt  al-Maqdis  and  they  were  the  ones supervising the only passage into the camp. The passage was closed on 15 Ramad\u0101n 1433, and it was at that time that hunger started assaulting the Muslims\u2019 bodies and death started reaping their souls until more than 170 people died due to lack of supplies and hunger.\nD\u0101biq: What is the relationship between Akn\u0101f Bayt  al-Maqdis  and  Hamas?

At the time, the mujahidin were preparing for a major operation in Hamah, so the two brothers headed out along with the rest of their battalion, leaving their base in \u2018Anadan in the Aleppo countryside and remaining stationed in Hamah in preparation for the operation. They had to exercise patience during this period as they awaited their opportunity to  fight  and  attain  martyrdom.  For  Abu  \u2018Abdillah, however, that opportunity would be delayed as he and a number of other mujahidin in their battalion were sent back to \u2018Anadan to guard their base, look after the families of the mujahidin who were in Hamah, and receive any new muhajirin joining the battalion. He  gracefully  accepted  this  decision  and  reminded the brothers with him that Allah was testing their patience and that soon their opportunity to fight would come. What helped keep him firm then as well as in the  face  of  many  other  difficult  circumstances  was that  Abu  \u2018Abdillah  would  regularly  recall  there  was wisdom behind Allah\u2019s decrees.\nAs such, he remained patient even though his op-\nportunity  to  perform  ribat  (frontier  guarding)  and take part in battles against the enemies of Allah would come  much  later  due  to  his  medical  condition.  He had a blood disorder, which made it difficult for him to take part in any activities that could lead to strenuous or stressful circumstances. However, just as his brother had refused to let his asthma get in the way of fighting for the cause of Allah, so too did Abu \u2018Abdillah refuse to let his condition prevent him from doing the same. They had both struggled to perform hijrah despite their conditions, and were not about to give up after reaching the point they had come to. Thus, Abu Ibrahim performed ribat and also took part in a number of battles, both in Aleppo and Hamah, and Abu \u2018Abdillah waited patiently until his opportunity to perform ribat and fight finally came a few months after the start of the Sahwah in the Levant. During this period of waiting and preparation, Abu \u2018Abdillah would contribute to the efforts of the mujahidin by taking on other roles.\nHis brother, having taken part in the operation in Hamah, later headed out with a group of mujahidin to join the effort to capture the city of Safirah in the Aleppo countryside from the Nusayri regime shortly before the start of the Sahwah in the Levant. He took part in a battle in the village of Tall Hasil located near Safirah and was quick to volunteer when the commander asked for a group of brothers to infiltrate \n\fChristians and to destroy that vile race from the lands of  our  friends.\u201d  This  launched  the  Crusades,  which continue today. Popes thereafter, for centuries, overtly and loudly professed their goal of eradicating Islam through war and conversion, as the 15th century Pope Callixtus III made a vow \u201cto extirpate the diabolical sect of the reprobate and faithless Mahomet [Islam] in the East;\u201d and as his predecessor Eugene IV expressed his hope that \u201cvery many from the abominable sect of Mahomet will be converted to the Catholic faith\u201d (Council of Basel in 1434).\nAs the war between Islam and the pagan Church raged, and for fear of losing their own followers to Islam, some on the Christian side began speaking more directly about their enemy and the real Islamic goal to destroy their manmade systems and perverted \u201cfreedoms.\u201d Benedict XVI \u2013 the predecessor of Francis \u2013 explained, for example, that democracy \u201ccontradicts the essence of Islam, which simply does not have the separation of the political and the religious sphere that Christianity has had from the beginning\u201d (Truth and Tolerance). Despite being a liar, he certainly spoke the truth on this issue \u2013 democracy undoubtedly contradicts the essence of Islam \u2013 showing thereby that the apostates from Islam, like many of the \u201cimams\u201d in the West and teachers at so-called \u201cIslamic\u201d universities, have less of an understanding of Islam than Benedict the Disbeliever has.\nSome time later, Benedict would again attempt to disparage Islam by mocking the Prophet Muhammad g, but for something the Prophet shared with most of  the  prophets  of  the  Torah,  the  Psalms,  and  the Gospel, which was the order to spread the religion by the  sword.1  Benedict  thus  belittled  the  order  found in the Old and New Testaments for war against the pagans upon quoting the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, who had said, \u201cShow me just what Mohammed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.\u201d The religion of Islam will continue to be spread by the sword, even if Benedict despises such. May Allah expose  Benedict\u2019s  evil  and  inhumanity  and  uncover for the world the true reason behind his scandalous resignation from the pagan Papacy.\nDespite the clarity of past and perished popes re-\n1  To read biblical texts on the obligation of spreading the religion via the sword, see \u201cBy the Sword\u201d on pages 78-80 of this issue.\nBenedict XVI, Pope Francis\u2019 predecessor\ngarding their enmity for Islam and its teachings, the current pope, Francis, has struggled against reality to advertise the apostate\u2019s perversion of Islamic teachings as the actual religion of Muslims. So while Benedict and many before him emphasized the enmity between the  pagan  Christians  and  monotheistic  Muslims, Francis\u2019 work is notably more subtle, steering clear of confrontational words that would offend those who falsely claim Islam, those apostates whom the Crusaders found played the perfect role for their infiltration into Muslim lands. While Benedict XVI met public disapproval for quoting a centuries-old Byzantine emperor,  Francis  continues  to  hide  behind  a  deceptive veil of \u201cgood will,\u201d covering his actual intentions of pacifying the Muslim nation. This is exemplified in Francis\u2019 statement that \u201cour respect for true followers of Islam should lead us to avoid hateful generalizations, for authentic Islam and the proper reading of the Quran are opposed to every form of violence\u201d (The Joy of the Gospel).\nPart of this approach to subdue Muslims through appeasement  involves  coordinating  with  the  infamous Ash\u2019ari Sufi institute, al-Azhar University, falsely attributed to being representative of Sunni Muslims worldwide. This method is an attempt to justify deviating claims that the Muslim nation has no central authority \u2013 as in a caliphate \u2013 but is rather \u201cmanaged\u201d in some way by scholars at universities. Adnane Mokrani, a Tunisian slave to the Catholic Church, commented on Francis\u2019 embracing of Ahmed el-Tayeb \u2013 the leader of Cairo\u2019s al-Azhar University \u2013 saying, \u201cIslam is not like the Catholic Church.

So everyone  who  lives  amongst  the  mushrik\u012bn while being able to perform hijrah and not being able to establish his religion, then he is wronging himself and committing sin. This is in accordance with  ijm\u0101\u2019.  Ab\u016b  D\u0101w\u016bd  reported  through  his isn\u0101d on the authority of Samurah Ibn Jundub (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anhum\u0101) that Ras\u016blull\u0101h (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  said,  \u2018Whoever  gathers  and lives with the mushrik, then he is like him.\u2019\u201d\nAlso, if there were no evidences for the obligation of  hijrah  except  the  following  ah\u0101d\u012bth  of  the Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam),  \u201cHijrah will  not  cease  as  long  as  there  is  repentance, and  repentance  will  not  cease  until  the  sun rises from the West\u201d [Reported by Ab\u016b D\u0101w\u016bd], \u201cHijrah will not cease as long as there is jih\u0101d\u201d [Reported by Im\u0101m Ahmad], \u201cI have nothing to do  with  any  Muslim  who  resides  amongst  the mushrik\u012bn\u201d  [Reported  by  Ab\u016b  D\u0101w\u016bd  and  atTirmidh\u012b], and, \u201cHijrah will not cease as long as the enemy is fought\u201d [Reported by Im\u0101m Ahmad and an-Nas\u0101\u2019\u012b], it would suffice us to refute the doubts of the doubters and the rumors of the fearmongers.\nTHE TWIN HALVES OF THE MUH\u0100JIR\u012aN\nThis ruling is an obligation upon women just as  it  is  upon  men,  for  Allah  (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101),  when excluding those incapable of performing hijrah, He excluded the incapable women just as He excluded  the  incapable  men.  Allah  (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) said,  {Except  for  the  oppressed  among  men, women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to a way \u2013 for those it is expected that Allah will pardon them, and Allah  is  ever  Pardoning  and  Forgiving}  [AnNis\u0101\u2019:  98-99].  The  Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi wa sallam) has also said, \u201cWomen are the twin halves of men\u201d [Reported by Ab\u016b D\u0101w\u016bd, atTirmidh\u012b, and Ibn M\u0101jah].\nAnd  today,  after  the  Muslims  established  a state that rules by the Qur\u2019\u0101n and the Sunnah of  the  Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam), which expanded to wide territories larger than the areas of some of the states of Sykes and Picot,  and  whose  blessed  soldiers  restored the  promised  khil\u0101fah  by  the  edge  of  the sword not through pacifism, the rate of hijrah magnified  and  now  every  day  there  are  not only  muh\u0101jir\u012bn  to  the  land  of  Islam  but  also muh\u0101jir\u0101t  who  were  sick  of  living  amongst kufr and its people. As soon as the sun of their awaited  state  rose,  they  rushed  to  it  alone and  in  groups  from  the  eastern and  western extents of the Earth. Their colors and tongues are different, but their hearts are united upon \u201cthere is no god but Allah.\u201d I remember the day I performed hijrah, I was the only Arab woman amongst the muh\u0101jirah sisters during that trip.\nIf  speaking  about  the  muh\u0101jir\u012bn  is  amazing, then  speaking  about  their  twin  halves  the muh\u0101jir\u0101t  is  even  more  amazing!  How  many stories  have  I  heard  which  I  would  not  have believed if not for hearing them directly from the mouths of those sisters involved or seeing these  sisters  with  my  own  eyes;  otherwise, I  would  have  thought  them  the  product  of imagination or something impossible!\nThe  opponents  often  repeat  that  those  who perform hijrah to the Islamic State belong to \ndabiq\n\fBecause much of what has befallen the Ummah is due to this deviant innovation, it is important for the muwahhid muj\u0101hid to have insight about the phenomenon especially in how it pertains to jih\u0101d.\nThe Salaf and Their Severe \nWarning against Irj\u0101\u2019\nThe Salaf who witnessed the emergence of Irj\u0101\u2019 warned  against  it  early  on.  They  knew  that  it would  lead  to  abandonment  of  both  learning and practicing the religion.\nSa\u2019\u012bd Ibn Jubayr (rahimahull\u0101h \u2013 d. 95AH) said, \u201cThe Murji\u2019ah are the Jews of the Qiblah\u201d1 [AsSunnah \u2013 \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn al-Im\u0101m Ahmad].\nIbr\u0101h\u012bm  an-Nakha\u2019\u012b  (rahimahull\u0101h  \u2013  d.  96AH) said,  \u201cI  fear  the  fitnah  of  the  Murji\u2019ah  for  this Ummah more than the fitnah of the Az\u0101riqah [a sect of the Khaw\u0101rij]\u201d [As-Sunnah \u2013 \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn al-Im\u0101m Ahmad].\nHe also said, \u201cI fear the Murji\u2019ah for the people of Islam more than their number of the Az\u0101riqah\u201d [As-Sunnah \u2013 \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn al-Im\u0101m Ahmad].\nHe  also  said,  \u201cIn  my  opinion,  the  Khaw\u0101rij  are more excused than the Murji\u2019ah\u201d [As-Sunnah \u2013 \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn al-Im\u0101m Ahmad].\nHe  also  said,  \u201cThe  Murji\u2019ah  left  the  religion flimsier than a very thin garment\u201d [As-Sunnah \u2013 \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn al-Im\u0101m Ahmad].\nHe also said, \u201cThe Murji\u2019ah invented an opinion, so I fear them for the Ummah. The evil from them is great, so be very wary of them\u201d [Ash-Shar\u012b\u2019ah \u2013 Al-\u0100jurr\u012b].\nHe  also  said,  \u201cI  don\u2019t  know  of  a  more  foolish people  by  way  of  their  opinion  than  these Murji\u2019ah\u201d  [As-Sunnah  \u2013  \u2018Abdull\u0101h  Ibn  al-Im\u0101m Ahmad].\nMuj\u0101hid (rahimahull\u0101h \u2013 d. 104AH) said, \u201cThey \n40 FEATURE\nstart  off  as  Murji\u2019ah,  then  become  Qadariyyah [those  who  deny  the  Qadar],  then  turn  into Maj\u016bs [fire-worshippers]\u201d [Al-L\u0101lik\u0101\u2019\u012b].\nQat\u0101dah  (rahimahull\u0101h  \u2013  d.  118AH)  and  Yahy\u0101 Ibn  Ab\u012b  Kath\u012br  (rahimahull\u0101h  \u2013  d.  129AH)  both said, \u201cThere is no deviance more feared by us for the  Ummah  than  Irj\u0101\u2019\u201d  [As-Sunnah  \u2013  \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn al-Im\u0101m Ahmad].\nMuhammad Ibn \u2018Al\u012b Ibn al-Husayn (rahimahull\u0101h \u2013 d. 118AH) said, \u201cThere is nothing in day or night more similar to the Jews than the Murji\u2019ah\u201d [AlL\u0101lik\u0101\u2019\u012b].______________1  The  Murji\u2019ah  invented  a  religion  whose  followers  expect  to  enter  Jannah  while completely abandoning the essential deeds of \u012am\u0101n (the four pillars of Islam after the testimony of faith) and claiming to affirm its words! Accordingly, they are similar to the deluded Jews who {believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part} [Al-Baqarah: 85] and say, {\u201cWe hear and disobey\u201d} [Al-Baqarah: 93], yet they declare, {\u201cNever will the Fire touch us except for a few days\u201d} [Al-Baqarah: 80] and {\u201cWe will be forgiven\u201d} [Al-A\u2019r\u0101f:  169].  The  Salaf  also  compared  Irj\u0101\u2019  to  Christianity,  as  some  of  them  were reported to have said, \u201cBe wary of Irj\u0101\u2019 for it is an aspect of Christianity\u201d [Al-L\u0101lik\u0101\u2019\u012b]. This is because the Christians, like the Jews, claim salvation is attainable by mere words with absolutely no deeds to back those words; Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) responded to the Jews by saying, {Say, \u201cHave you taken a covenant with Allah? For Allah will never break His covenant. Or do you say about Allah that which you do not know?\u201d Yes, whoever earns evil and his sin has encompassed him \u2013 those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally. But they who believe and do righteous deeds \u2013 those are the companions of Paradise;  they will  abide  therein  eternally}  [Al-Baqarah:  80-82]. He (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101)  responded to the Christians as well as the Jews by saying, {And they say, \u201cNone will enter Paradise except  one  who  is  a  Jew  or  a  Christian.\u201d  That  is  [merely]  their  wishful  thinking,  Say, \u201cProduce your proof, if you should be truthful.\u201d Yes on the contrary, whoever submits his face in Islam to Allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve} [Al-Baqarah: 111-112]. See also S\u016brat an-Nis\u0101\u2019, verses 123-124. The Jews and Christians both declared that the mere claim of faith in their messengers was sufficient to save them from Hellfire while they abandoned the essential implications of this faith, which was for them to follow the final Prophet Muhammad (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) in both words and deeds, as he was prophesized in their scriptures. Finally, Allah\u2019s mercy and forgiveness is not an excuse to commit sins and injustices never mind shirk and kufr!\n\f", "schema:headline": "TO OUR SISTERS", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "32"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq12-AMONGST-THE-BELIEVERS-ARE-MEN", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "12", "schema:articleBody": "Ab\u016b  Junaydah,  whose  parents  are  from  Morocco,  grew up in the crusader country of Germany. Like most youth from migrant families, he was somewhat distant from his religion despite his father and mother both then being religious Muslims. And although life in d\u0101rul-kufr led many Muslim youth to abandon the daily prayers, Ab\u016b Junaydah was an exception. No matter what he faced in life, he would never forget sal\u0101h.\nWhen  he  was  a  child,  his  father  made  him  memorize some of the Qur\u2019\u0101n and go with him to the masjid. When he grew older, he appreciated this discipline as due to it, he had learned much of the book of Allah.\nAnd so Allah guides whomever He wills and He showed His mercy towards Ab\u016b Junaydah, guiding him to serious practice at the age of eighteen. He began to learn his religion on his own effort and distance himself from all bad influences. He also married early to protect himself from the traps of zin\u0101. Shortly after, Allah bestowed him with a daughter, whom he named Junaydah.\nSaddened by the events in Sh\u0101m and the crimes committed against Ahlus-Sunnah, he resolved to perform hijrah there to partake in the jih\u0101d.\nIn \u201c2013,\u201d he travelled to Sh\u0101m and joined the faction called \u201cJun\u016bd ash-Sh\u0101m,\u201d led by the deviant liar Muslim ash-Sh\u012bsh\u0101n\u012b. Upon arrival, Ab\u016b Junaydah was very happy to have arrived to the lands of jih\u0101d, but he quickly found out that not every \u201cmuj\u0101hid\u201d and not every \u201cjih\u0101d\u012b\u201d faction is on the sound manhaj. He and the other muj\u0101hid\u012bn were forbidden from pronouncing takf\u012br upon the t\u0101gh\u016bt Erdogan and the other taw\u0101gh\u012bt of Turkey for reasons of \u201cmaslahah.\u201d Similarly, they were forbidden from pronouncing takf\u012br upon the \u201cFree Syrian Army\u201d (FSA). He witnessed how he himself as well as the Islamic State were strongly criticized for this. There were also many situations in which the law of Allah was violated by the local factions; the people weren\u2019t being judged by the Shar\u012b\u2019ah. In one of these cases, for example, a local person insulted Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) and did not receive punishment for his crime.\nWhile he was with Jun\u016bd ash-Sh\u0101m, he was joined by his best friend Ab\u016b Luqm\u0101n al-Alm\u0101n\u012b and Ab\u016b Junaydah\u2019s \n5555\nAMONGST THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN\ncousin Ab\u016b Hafs al-Alm\u0101n\u012b in order to wage jih\u0101d against the taw\u0101gh\u012bt everywhere and their allies. But Ab\u016b Luqm\u0101n and Ab\u016b Hafs did not stay long with Jun\u016bd ash-Sh\u0101m, as they  quickly  recognized  the  corrupt  and  deviant  manhaj of  the  faction  and  understood  that  they  should  join  the Jam\u0101\u2019ah. Thus they both gave bay\u2019ah to Am\u012brul-Mu\u2019min\u012bn Ab\u016b Bakr al-Husayn\u012b al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (hafidhahull\u0101h), joining the Islamic State.\nOn the day of the Sahwah treachery, Ab\u016b Luqm\u0101n and Ab\u016b Hafs were captured by the FSA and imprisoned with hundreds of other muh\u0101jir\u012bn. But they deceived their captors into releasing them. This led them to meet Ab\u016b Junaydah again, who had abandoned Jun\u016bd ash-Sh\u0101m for the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front shortly before the Sahwah. He began to work in the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front\u2019s media department.\nBecause of Ab\u016b Sulaym\u0101n the Australian\u2019s lies, Ab\u016b Junaydah had some misconceptions about the Islamic State, but his heart was longing to join the Jam\u0101\u2019ah, to be on its side while the whole world had assembled against it militarily, politically, economically, and even in the media realm. He also began catching many contradictions in the claims of Ab\u016b  Sulaym\u0101n  the  Australian  and  his  Sahwah  comrades against the Islamic State. In addition to this, Ab\u016b Hafs \u2013 who was stuck in Halab after his release from the early Sahwah prisons \u2013 would regularly advise Ab\u016b Junaydah to join the Islamic State.\nAnd Allah guides whomever He wills. Ab\u016b Junaydah listened to the speeches of the senile and deviant Dhaw\u0101hir\u012b and those of the former war minister of the Islamic State, Shaykh Ab\u016b Hamzah al-Muh\u0101jir r.

It is just as the Lord said, explaining this phenomenon of the majority\u2019s rejection of the truth, \u201cAnd most of mankind refuse [to follow anything] but disbelief\u201d (Al-Isra 89).\nAs  is  well  known,  these  messengers did  not  come  empty-handed.  Each of  them  brought  with  him  a  message, often in the form of a scripture, something for the educated to read and comprehend, yet with the simple command of monotheistic worship of the Creator that even the illiterate could follow. So Moses  was  given  the Torah,  by  which the  Tribes  of  Israel  were  governed  for many  generations.  But  they  strayed from  its  original  message,  even  with their very own scribes changing its text, as the Tanakh1 testifies, \u201cHow can you say, \u2018We are wise, and the law (Torah) of the Lord is with us\u2019? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes has made it into a lie\u201d (Jeremiah 8:8).2 So then Jesus brought the Gospel, confirming what came before him of the Torah and permitting \u2013 by the permission  of  his  Lord  \u2013  some  of  what  was  forbidden therein. It was reported that he said, \u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them\u201d (Matthew 5:17). However, just as the Torah was not fully preserved, even altered, the Gospel was also corrupted. Its original would be lost, with the oldest related manuscripts written only as commentary to the original. So instead of having an altered \u201cGospel of Jesus,\u201d one finds the Gospel according to Matthew, then Mark, then Luke, then John, each with a unique take on various aspects of Jesus\u2019 teachings, sometimes outright contradicting one another. To say the least, the authentic scripture was lost and the people strayed.As per the divine way of the Lord, another messenger was sent to bring the lost flocks back to the path of righteousness. He would be the awaited Prophet foretold by Moses and the coming Advocate prophesied by Jesus. Moreover, he would bring a message hold-\n1  The Tanakh are the Jewish scriptures consisting of three parts: the Law (Torah), the Prophets, and the Writings.2  Due to ease of reading, the English Standard Version of the Bible is used herein unless otherwise noted.\ning the promise of divine protection and heralding its bearer as the Seal of the Prophets, the final messenger, sent not to the Tribes of Israel alone \u2013 but to all of mankind. For the same Lord who sent Moses and Jesus  also  sent  Muhammad,  about  whom  He  said, \u201cMuhammad is not the father of any of your men, but [he is] the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets\u201d (Al-Ahzab 40), and about whose message He said, \u201cVerily We revealed the Reminder and verily We shall preserve it\u201d (Al-Hijr 9).\nSeeking the Truth\nFalsehood should be rejected because it is false, just as the truth should be accepted and followed because it is true. It is not a matter of tradition, for the Lord has ordered that all nations be called to His worship.The pagan who feigns the excuse that religion is no more than family tradition should not be left to his deviance  without  receiving  proper  admonition.  No one should.\nLikewise, no nation \u2013 no matter how originally pure \u2013 is free of corruptive infiltrations. Even the nation of Muhammad g, as the years passed following his death, fell victim to various deviations in creed \u2013 some even reaching apostasy \u2013 at the hands of those who rejected  a  correct  understanding  of  faith,  of  Allah\u2019s oneness, and of the divine law in general. This was \n\fChristian paganism is widespread in Trinidad and Tobago\nknowledge of only the first two commandments gave me the understanding that what they were practicing was not in line with the truth. At this point, I didn\u2019t consider myself part of any of the Christian denominations, but that was as far as I got.\nIn school, I was exposed to all the various religions but I remained upon what I knew. When I was around twenty years old, I would come to accept the religion of truth, Islam. I was working at a call center and got to  know  a  Muslim  co-worker  there.  We  happened to share many of the same worldly interests, and for this  reason,  I  would  spend  much  time  with  him.  I used to ask him many questions about the religion. In our conversations I would ask him about the beliefs of Muslims, and would also ask him about Jesus and Muhammad, and everything he told me made sense to  me  and  was  in  line  with  what  I  remembered  of the first two commandments, so I quickly gravitated towards Islam and soon found myself debating Christians because I knew their beliefs were corrupt.\nSometimes, because I was drawn to Islam, when I saw him praying, I would pray like him, and when I did, I would feel very calm afterwards. I accompanied him to the Friday sermon a couple of times to see what it was about, and then became certain that this was the true religion \u2013 the religion of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. In the last conversation we had before  I  embraced  Islam,  I  told  him  that  I  was  planning on selling drugs to support my family. He said that this was wrong and that the ends don\u2019t justify the means. So I replied, \u201cYou tell me that in Islam I can kill people but I can\u2019t sell drugs to feed my family?\u201d He then began explaining to me the ultimate purpose \nof jihad as well as enlightening me concerning some of the Muslims\u2019 plights, and after the conversation, I was settled. So I declared the testimony of faith and became a Muslim.\nDabiq: How did you find the da\u2019wah to jihad?\nAbu Sa\u2019d at-Trinidadi: There was a faction of Muslims in Trinidad that was known for \u201cmilitancy.\u201d Its members  attempted  to  overthrow  the  disbelieving government but quickly surrendered, apostatized, and participated in the religion of democracy, demonstrating that they weren\u2019t upon the correct methodology of jihad. In my case, like so many other Muslims in the West, the da\u2019wah to jihad took hold of me through the lectures of Shaykh Anwar al-\u2018Awlaqi \uf08a.

The meeting factions have reached a consensus on the following:\u201d\n\u201c1. We welcome the call to start a political process that leads to a political transition according to the Geneva Communiqu\u00e9 that stipulates establishing a transitional governing body that starts functioning as soon as an agreement on a solution is reached, and thus, performing all executive authorities, including those of the President of the Republic.\u201d\n\u201c2.

It was a state based upon tawh\u012bd and jih\u0101d with a Qurash\u012b im\u0101m. It was a foundation for the future khil\u0101fah. Its leadership disbelieved in defeatist compromise and relied upon Allah alone, even if such entailed being fought by the entire camp of kufr and deviance.\nA few months later, the Iraqi Sahwah was launched. The Americans  provided  corrupt  tribes  and  partisan  factions with the incentive and aid for the newly formed Sahwah to wage a treacherous war against the Islamic State. The Islamic State then, in 1427-1428AH, began losing territory to these crusader-backed apostates. It was experiencing just some of the tests and tribulations that all truthful believers face, as in the had\u012bth, \u201cThe people who face the severest tribulations are the Prophets, then those most like them, then  those  most  like  them.  A  person  is  tested  with  tribulation to the extent of his religious practice. If his practice is strong, the tribulation he faces is stronger. And if his practice is weak, the tribulation he faces is in accordance with his religious practice\u201d [Sah\u012bh: Reported by at-Tirmidh\u012b from Sa\u2019d Ibn Ab\u012b Waqq\u0101s].\nDuring the tumult of this Sahwah conspiracy, a point came in which it appeared to the weak-hearted that the Islamic State would be a legend of the past, reminding us of the Battle of al-Ahz\u0101b {when they came at you from above you and from below you, and when eyes turned upwards [in fear], and hearts reached the throats and you assumed about Allah various assumptions. There the believers were tested and shaken severely. And remember when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease said, \u201cAllah and His \nMessenger did not promise us except delusion\u201d} [Al-Ahz\u0101b: 10-12]. This was what occurred throughout the events of the Sahwah in Iraq. The believers were shaken severely but remained firm, whereas the hypocrites came out and began to criticize the creed and methodology of the Islamic State.\nAnd despite these great tribulations; a man spoke out with a truthful tongue and sincere heart; we consider him such and Allah is his judge. He was the recently appointed Am\u012br of the Believers, Shaykh Ab\u016b \u2018Umar al-Husayn\u012b al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (may Allah accept him). He spoke his words holding good assumptions about Allah, being certain of Allah\u2019s promise, and having no doubts that Allah would ever forsake them. He said in his famous speech \u201cThe Harvest of the Years by the State of the Muwahhid\u012bn,\u201d released six months after the declaration of the Islamic State in Iraq and during the dark waves of the Sahwah:\n\u201cThe Islamic State is b\u0101qiyah (remaining). It is b\u0101qiyah because it was built from the corpses of the shuhad\u0101\u2019 and it was watered with their blood, and by this the market of Jannah was convened. It is b\u0101qiyah because the success granted by Allah in this jih\u0101d is clearer than the sun in the middle of the sky. It is b\u0101qiyah because it was not soiled by har\u0101m income nor a distorted methodology. It is b\u0101qiyah by the truthfulness of the leaders who sacrificed their blood and the truthfulness of the soldiers who raised it with their forearms; we consider them such, and Allah is their judge. It is b\u0101qiyah because it united the muj\u0101hid\u012bn and is the refuge of the oppressed. It is b\u0101qiyah because Islam has begun to rise  and  climb,  the  dark  cloud  has  begun  to  scatter,  and kufr has begun to be defeated and exposed. It is b\u0101qiyah because it is the supplication of the oppressed, the tear of the bereaved, the cry of the prisoner, and the hope of the \n1717\nFROM THE PAGES OF HISTORY: B\u0100QIYAH\n\f", "schema:headline": "THE ALLIES OF AL-Q\u0100\u2019IDAH IN SH\u0100M: THE END", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "11"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq5-HIKMAH-", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "5", "schema:articleBody": "Tam\u012bm  ad-D\u0101r\u012b  (radiyall\u0101hu  \u2018anh)  narrated that Ras\u016blull\u0101h (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) said, \u201cThis religion will reach all places night and day reach.

But  destroying  ISIS,  even  in a  couple  of  years,  is  just  not  possible.  If  we  succeed  in dismantling ISIS, we\u2019re still left with a really problematic region.\nRobinson:  This  kind  of  partnered  counterterrorism  approach that the president has been talking about requires really refining how America deals with its partners. In this case,  every  partner  is  problematic.  Iraqi  security  forces have  crumbled  in  recent  months.  The  Shia  militias  are problematic.  The  Sunnis  could  potentially  turn  against ISIS, but they are very wary of this new government. The Peshmurgas, the Kurdish militia, are least problematic. Finally, the Syrian opposition is terribly weak.\nConnable: I\u2019m not sure anybody has a clear understanding of who\u2019s who in Syria. Identities and loyalties shift. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to cripple the strategy, but it is a serious  hurdle. The absence of a clearly envisioned end state condition is important. What is it that we want this group that we\u2019re going to support to do after ISIS is defeated? The Free Syrian Army is the group we go to now. They\u2019ve suffered battlefield defeats. They\u2019re politically disorganized. I\u2019m not sure what they would do with the Syrian state if they were able to assume control. \nLiepman: We need to remind ourselves that the president said, as did his military commanders, that this new phase of fighting against a determined and impressive enemy, will  take  some  time.  We  need  to  be  careful  about  how we define victory. We won\u2019t vanquish this enemy. We\u2019ll be lucky to degrade ISIS. We need patience. \nRabasa: I\u2019m afraid we may have fallen into ISIS\u2019s trap. We probably had no choice but to extend the airstrikes into Syria, since that is ISIS\u2019s base of operations. But by doing so we have escalated the campaign against ISIS without deploying sufficient force to seriously degrade or destroy them. \nRabasa:  Airstrikes  will  have  diminishing  returns  as  ISIS adjusts. And standing up to the United States is likely to enhance its image among both jihadi and non-jihadi constituencies.

We\u2019ve never seen an organization like ISIL that is so well-organized, so  well-trained,  so  well-funded,  so  strategic, so brutal, so completely ruthless. We\u2019ve never seen anything quite like that in one institution. Then they blend in ideology which will eventually lose*, we get that, and social media.

And  [then]  you  did  your deed which you did, and you were of the ungrateful.\u201d  [M\u016bs\u0101]  said,  \u201cI  did  it,  then,  while  I was of those astray\u201d} [Ash-Shu\u2019ar\u0101\u2019: 18-20].\nThe new Man Haron Monis was a muj\u0101hid in the  path  of  Allah.  He  declared  himself  to  be upon  pure  tawh\u012bd  and  from  Ahlus-Sunnah, announced  his  bay\u2019ah  to  Khal\u012bfah  Ibr\u0101him  alQurash\u012b,  and  then  marched  forward  to  terrorize  the  kuff\u0101r  and  bring  victory  to  Allah\u2019s religion. His shah\u0101dah is \u2013 insh\u0101\u2019all\u0101h \u2013 a testament to his sincerity.\nFOREWORD\nAfter a lengthy standoff, brother Man Haron Monis was killed. His daring raid ended with two k\u0101fir hostages dead, and four others wounded, including a police officer. Thus, he added his name to the list of Muslims who answered the Khil\u0101fah\u2019s call to strike those waging war against the Islamic State wherever they may be, as conveyed by its spokesman, Shaykh Ab\u016b Muhammad al-\u2018Adn\u0101n\u012b. \u201cIf you can kill a disbelieving American or European \u2013 especially the spiteful and filthy French \u2013 or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be. Do not ask for anyone\u2019s advice and do not seek anyone\u2019s verdict\u201d [Indeed Your Lord Is Ever Watchful].\nThere will be others who follow the examples set by Man Haron Monis and Numan Haider in Australia, Martin Couture-Rouleau and Michael Zehaf-Bibeau in Canada, Zale Thompson in America, and Bertrand Nzohabonayo in France, and all that the West will be able to do is to anxiously await the next round of slaughter and then issue the same  tired,  clich\u00e9  statements  in  condemnation of it when it occurs. The Muslims will continue to defy the k\u0101fir war machine, flanking the crusaders on their own streets and bringing the war back to their own soil.\nBERTRAND NZOHABONAYO (RAHIMAHULL\u0100H)\n\fpath of Allah? So Allah\u2019s Messenger (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) said, \u2018Whoever fights so that the word of Allah is the highest is fighting in the path of Allah.\u2019\u201d\n[2] Ask the people of knowledge what is required of you when anything befalls you concerning the obligation of jih\u0101d in the path of Allah, for there is  a  scholarly  consensus  that  knowledge  must precede  action.  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa salllam) said, \u201cSeeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.\u201d  So don\u2019t kill or  take  ghan\u012bmah  without  first  knowing  why you\u2019re doing so. And the least that can be done in that regard is to seek the fatw\u0101 of a scholar whose  knowledge  and  religious  practice  you trust.\n[3]  Beware  of  letting  the  affection  you  have towards a relative or loved one turn you away from  aiding  Allah\u2019s  religion.  Indeed,  we  know that this can tear you apart, but remember the statement of Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101), {O you who have believed, do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies, extending to them affection while they  have  disbelieved  in  what  came  to  you  of the truth} [Al-Mumtahanah: 1]. For Allah\u2019s right is more obligatory, and supporting His religion is more essential.\n[4] By Allah, I love you, and I love that which will save you. So listen to my advice concerning an important issue, the issue of takf\u012br. The Messenger (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) said, \u201cWhoever says concerning a believer that which is not true, Allah will cause him to reside in the mud of  corruption  [composed  of  the  pus  from  the people of Hellfire] until he takes back what he said.\u201d  Therefore, know my dear brother that the label and ruling of kufr is a right that belongs to Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) and which you are not allowed to apply to anyone except those who deserve it according to the Shar\u012b\u2019ah. And know that takf\u012br has both conditions and preventative factors, so we don\u2019t declare takf\u012br of someone unless the conditions are fulfilled and the preventative factors are  eliminated.  A  person  might  make  a  state-\nADVICE FOR THE SOLDIERS OF THE ISLAMIC STATE\nment  or  action  of  kufr  and  yet  would  not  be guilty of kufr due to the presence of one of the preventative factors. Therefore, one whose Islam is established with certainty is not expelled from  Islam  except  with  certainty.  So  beware of  suspicion,  and  ensure  that  you\u2019re  well-informed regarding the issues that the practicing scholars have differed over.\n[5] Fulfill any agreements and covenants of security that are valid according to the Shar\u012b\u2019ah, and be extremely cautious of Shayt\u0101n\u2019s incitements. Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) said, {So he who breaks his word  only  breaks  it  to  the  detriment  of  himself} [Al-Fath: 10]. Allah\u2019s Messenger (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  said,  \u201cThe  blood  of  every Muslim is equal. The lowest amongst them will have  his  guarantee  of  protection  fulfilled  by them. The most distant of them will also have his guarantee of protection honored. They are one hand against all others. The weak fighter amongst them is equal in his share of ghan\u012bmah with the strong fighter amongst them, and the dispatched fighter who guards the rear of the army is equal in his share of ghan\u012bmah with the fighter who is sent out on an expedition to attack.\u201d\nLikewise, know that we do not allow any soldier to make pacts or grant security. This is only to be done by Am\u012brul-Mu\u2019min\u012bn and his deputies, for he is typically more aware of, and better capable of determining the interests of the State.\n[6] Strive hard to obey Allah and beware the ominous consequences of sin as well as the evil of your inner self and the Shayt\u0101n. For indeed alF\u0101r\u016bq, \u2018Umar Ibn al-Khatt\u0101b, advised Sa\u2019d Ibn Ab\u012b Waqq\u0101s (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anhum\u0101) saying, \u201cSo I order both you and the soldiers who are with you to have taqw\u0101 of Allah, and I order both you and the soldiers who are with you to be more vigilant against committing sins than you are against your enemy, for the sins of your soldiers should be more feared than their enemy.

It was a rash decision of arrogance from Russia, as if it held that its wars against the Muslims of al-Qawq\u0101z were not enough offence. And so after having discovered a way to compromise the security at the Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport and resolving to bring down a plane belonging to a nation in the American-led Western coalition against the Islamic State, the target was changed to a Russian plane. A bomb was smuggled onto the airplane, \nleading to the deaths of 219 Russians and 5 other crusaders only a month after Russia\u2019s thoughtless decision.\nA year earlier, on \u201c19 September 2014,\u201d France haughtily began executing airstrikes against the Khil\u0101fah. Like Russia, it was blinded by hubris, thinking that its geographical distance from the lands of the Khil\u0101fah would protect it from the justice of the muj\u0101hid\u012bn. It also did not grasp that its mockery of the Messenger g would not be left unavenged. Thus, the Islamic State dispatched its brave knights to wage war in the homelands of the wicked crusaders, leaving Paris and its residents \u201cshocked and awed.\u201d The eight knights brought Paris down on its knees, after years of French conceit in the face of Islam. A nationwide state of emergency was declared as a result of the actions of eight men armed only with assault rifles and explosive belts.\nAnd so revenge was exacted upon those who felt safe in the cockpits of their jets.\nAm\u012brul-Mu\u2019min\u012bn Ab\u016b Bakr al-Husayn\u012b al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (hafidhahull\u0101h) said, \u201cBy Allah, we will take revenge! By Allah, we will take revenge! Even if it takes a while, we will take revenge,  and  every  amount  of  harm  against  the  Ummah will  be  responded  to  with  multitudes  more  against  the perpetrator. {And those who, when tyranny strikes them, they defend themselves} [Ash-Sh\u016br\u0101: 39]. Soon, by Allah\u2019s permission, a day will come when the Muslim will walk everywhere as a master, having honor, being revered, with his head raised high, and his dignity preserved. Anyone who dares to offend him will be disciplined, and any hand that reaches out to harm him will be cut off. So let the world know that we are living today in a new era. Whoever was heedless  must  now  be  alert.  Whoever  was  sleeping  must \n2\n\fAs the Sahwah fever spreads through the ranks of al-Q\u0101\u2019idah from Sh\u0101m to its other branches, it is important to study the relationship between the other branches and regional apostate parties, as these relationships in addition to the irj\u0101\u2019 and hizbiyyah of al-Q\u0101\u2019idah\u2019s leadership are the crucial driving  force  in  converting  al-Q\u0101\u2019idah  branches  from  parties resisting the American-led crusades into hardcore sahw\u0101t.\nIn Khur\u0101s\u0101n, al-Q\u0101\u2019idah is with the Taliban factions who announced their adoption of nationalism and resistance towards wal\u0101\u2019 and bar\u0101\u2019, lied to the Ummah by attributing their deviant declarations to the deceased Mull\u0101 \u2018Umar, and shamelessly  flaunted  their  brotherhood  with  the  apostate taw\u0101gh\u012bt and the R\u0101fidah. In India, they are the allies of the nationalist Kashmir factions whose advances and withdrawals are only by the order of the apostate Pakistani army. In North Africa, they are the allies of the Libyan factions who partook in the religion of democracy in the name of \u201cIslam.\u201d\nAnd in Yemen, one of the top allies of al-Q\u0101\u2019idah \u2013 after the \u2018Abd Rabbuh battalions, the \u201cIsl\u0101h\u201d parliamentarians, and the pro-Saudi \u201cSalafiyyah\u201d of Dammaj and Ma\u2019rib \u2013 is the \u201cHadhrami Domestic Council.\u201d According to the introduction found on the council\u2019s official website, \u201cThe Hadhrami Domestic Council in the city of al-Mukall\u0101 \u2013 the capital of Hadramawt \u2013 was formed and then announced on Monday, 13 April 2015, to be an authority for administering \n55\nTHE ALLIES OF AL-Q\u0100\u2018IDAH IN YEMEN\nKh\u0101lid B\u0101turf\u012b - The new Har\u0101r\u012b of Yemen\nthe affairs of the Hadramawt capital city of al-Mukall\u0101 after  being  granted  control  over  it  by  those  who  collapsed it \u2013 Ans\u0101r ash-Shar\u012b\u2019ah, \u2018The Sons of Hadramawt\u20191 \u2013 on 2 April 2015.2 The Hadhrami Domestic Council was formed by a fine selection of the sincere men of Hadramawt including religious scholars, prominent figures, tribal figures, social  figures,  businessmen,  academics,  engineers,  media professionals, and officers in the army and security forces.

They kept it from being a target of foreign forces, lack of authority and security, theft, destruction, and chaos. This is from the most important goals for which the Hadhrami Domestic Council was formed, in addition to shouldering the responsibility of administering the affairs of the city with the aid of the citizens and by preserving its security and stability and securing the continued delivery of necessary services including water, food supplies, electricity, medical care, waste management, education, and other services.

Having heeded the lessons of years spent fighting the harshest of wars in modern times, the soldiers of the Islamic State promise their adversaries dark days of death and destruction in their own lands. Bullets and shrapnel will slash and pierce all those whom Allah\u2019s  soldiers  reach.  Survivors  will  be  scarred  physically  and mentally, haunted whenever their eyes are closed, whenever they blink. The sounds of sirens will fill the air, preceded by blasts from bombs planted in all the right places. The damage to their economy, their infrastructure, and their sources of income will make their lives harder than they now imagine. And it will not end there, not until the rule of Allah reaches east to west and the Muslims walk undisturbed by the k\u0101fir filth beneath them.\nUnlike the slaves of Shayt\u0101n, who strike with all their mortal might yet fear their mortal fate, the slaves of ar-Rahm\u0101n are prepared to meet their Lord, hopeful of His acceptance. Those kuff\u0101r who presume their bombs and proxy soldiers will cause the Islamic State to stop should realize that the soldiers of the Khil\u0101fah have surrendered themselves to Allah, the Creator of all things and Master of the Universe. There is thus no possibility  of  their  surrender  to  humans.  The  crusaders,  on the other hand, have no eventual choice but to accept defeat. While arrogance will prevent them today, it is only a matter of time \u2013 after as many blessed operations as Allah facilitates for His soldiers in their lands \u2013 before the crusaders\u2019 resolve dissipates and they fall at the feet of the invading lions, appealing for amnesty and begging to pay jizyah.\n5\fhe  started  giving  da\u2019wah  in  his  neighborhood,  calling  the  youth  to  make  hijrah to  Sh\u0101m.  He  also  wrote  a  few  articles  on the crusades of the era fought by the West against the Muslims.\nAll  preparations  for  the  raids  in  Paris and Brussels started with him and his older brother Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. These two brothers gathered the weapons and the explosives. After the  blessed  raid  in  Paris,  he  saw  another dream, which motivated him to carry out an istishh\u0101d\u012b operation. He narrated, \u201cThe second  dream  was  three  months  ago.  It was a vision that took place from fajr until dhuhr. I arose to a high place, as if I was in space, surrounded by stars; but the sky was like the blue of night.\u201d He then heard a voice in the dream telling him that he was created only to worship Allah and ordering him to fight for His cause and make His word supreme. He then woke up.\nAb\u016b Wal\u012bd then narrated a third dream: \u201cI  had  a  vision  that  also  took  place  from fajr until dhuhr, but ended at night. I saw myself on a boat along with Ab\u016b Sulaym\u0101n and another brother. Each of us had a Turkish soldier as a hostage. I had a pistol and Ab\u016b Sulaym\u0101n had a belt. I told him to give me his belt, as I would feel better having it. So he gave me the belt and I gave him my pistol. I then quickly advanced with the Turkish hostage in order to close in on other soldiers, two of whom were in front of us. I detonated my belt, killing the soldiers. My head then descended to the ground. One of the brothers working on the operation and Shaykh al-\u2018Adn\u0101n\u012b took my head and said, \u2018Check to see if he is smiling or not.\u2019 I then saw my soul and those of the three soldiers. All of a sudden, the soldiers\u2019 souls burned and vanished and, suddenly, the banner of Islam  \u2013  represented  in  the  dream  by  the flag of the Islamic State \u2013 came out of the earth  and  was  shining  brightly.  My  soul then became full of light.\u201d He then heard a voice in the dream telling him that he had achieved  deliverance.  Ab\u016b  Wal\u012bd  continued,  \u201cI  prostrated  quickly  and  repeatedly pronounced  the  takb\u012br.  I  then  awoke  to find my heart beating fast, and I was taking quick breaths.\u201d\nNajm al-\u2018Ashr\u0101w\u012b (Ab\u016b Idr\u012bs al-Balj\u012bk\u012b)\nBrussels Airport Istishh\u0101d\u012b\nHe was a unique man, possessing excellent manners, always in the service of his brothers, and very intelligent. His hijrah began in \u201c2013,\u201d when he heard the cry of Muslims in Sh\u0101m. He joined Majlis Sh\u016br\u0101 al-Muj\u0101hid\u012bn led by Abul-Ath\u012br al\u2018Abs\u012b (may Allah accept him) and, when the traitor al-Jawl\u0101n\u012b betrayed the Islamic State, he was one of the first, along with the rest of his group, to pledge allegiance to Am\u012brul-Mu\u2019min\u012bn Ab\u016b Bakr al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b.\nHe participated in several battles against the Nusayr\u012b regime before the FSA apostates started to fight the muj\u0101hid\u012bn. Proving  himself  steadfast  during  the  sahwah  in  Sh\u0101m,  he fought them until the order came to withdraw to ar-Raqqah. He continued to participate in raids until he suffered a bullet wound to his leg in a raid against Jabhat al-Jawl\u0101n\u012b in alKhayr.\nAfter healing for several months, he began to train in order to realize his dream of returning to Europe to avenge the Muslims of Iraq and Sh\u0101m for the constant bombing by crusader warplanes. Upon completing his training, he traveled the long road to France to execute his operation. It was Ab\u016b Idr\u012bs who prepared the explosives for the two raids in Paris and Brussels.\nMuhammad Bilq\u0101\u2019id (Ab\u016b \u2018Abdil-\u2018Az\u012bz al-Jaz\u0101\u2019ir\u012b)Defended the Muj\u0101hid\u012bn During a Police Raid\nBefore returning to France, Ab\u016b \u2018Abdil-\u2018Az\u012bz participated in several raids against the Nusayr\u012b regime. The most prominent of these battles were those of Kuwayris Airbase and the 17th Division. During his campaigning, he suffered an injury to his leg while fighting the sahw\u0101t in Dimashq. He also took part in the conquest of ar-Ram\u0101d\u012b, where a bullet struck his head.He was a man full of wisdom, the commander of a group of  inghim\u0101s\u012b  troops.  Liked  by  all  of  the  brothers,  he  was known for his fasting, his praying throughout the night, and his constant reading of the Qur\u2019\u0101n. When he heard that Ab\u016b Idr\u012bs wanted to return to Europe to execute an istishh\u0101d\u012b operation, he immediately decided to accompany him and assist him in his mission.\nWhile in Belgium, and during the final stages of preparation for the raid in Brussels, k\u0101fir police stormed his apartment. Though he had the ability to escape with his team, he decided to make this his final stand and to ensure his brothers a  safe  exit.  He  exchanged  fire  with  the  Belgian  and  French forces  for  several  hours,  injuring  a  number  of  them,  as  his brothers took off into the forest.\n7\f", "schema:headline": "Foreword", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "4"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq14-Interview", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "14", "schema:articleBody": "under one im\u0101m and to listen to and obey him. Secondly, we have seen that the Khil\u0101fah declared by the leadership of the Islamic State has  fulfilled  all  the  conditions enumerated by the scholars from among the righteous Salaf of the Ummah.

They saw us fighting against all  the  kuff\u0101r  in  our  targeting  of the  crusaders,  the  R\u0101fidah,  the Q\u0101diy\u0101niyyah,  the  Hindus,  the missionaries, and others, all within  a  short  period  of  time.  They saw that with the help of Allah, a small number of muj\u0101hid\u012bn with limited  means  are  able  to  target and  intimidate  the  various  sects of kufr in any part of the region despite all the false claims of supremacy attributed to the t\u0101gh\u016bt \nforces and designed  to  intimidate the believers.

This became  evident  when  some  of the leading atheists in the region claimed  to  have  received  death threats  from  the  soldiers  of  the Khil\u0101fah in Bengal. But it is not the methodology of the Khil\u0101fah\u2019s soldiers  to  send  mere  threats  to the enemies of Allah. Rather, we let our actions do the talking.

So he killed their fighters, enslaved their children, and gained Juwayriyah. Ibn \u2018Umar told  me  this.

Ibn \u2018Uyaynah reported that \u2018Amr Ibn D\u012bn\u0101r said, \u201c\u2019Al\u012b Ibn Ab\u012b T\u0101lib wrote in his will, \u2018As to what follows: If something happens to me during this battle, then my slave-girls whom I copulate with are nineteen in number. Some of them bore me children, some of them are pregnant, and some of them are childless\u2019\u201d [Musannaf \u2018Abdir-Razz\u0101q].\nAb\u016b Sa\u2019\u012bd al-Khudr\u012b (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anh) said, \u201cI had a slave-girl with whom I used to practice withdrawal. She  bore  me  the  most  beloved  of  people  to  me\u201d [Musannaf \u2018Abdir-Razz\u0101q].\nAfter  all  this  and  after  the  sun  of  the  Khil\u0101fah radiated once again, and the winds of victory and consolidation  blew,  and  the  Islamic  State,  by  the grace  of  its  Lord  alone,  brought  out  the  Islamic punishments and rulings of the Shar\u012b\u2019ah from the darkness of books and papers, and we truly lived them after they were buried for centuries\u2026 After all this, the ramblers dare to extend their tongues with false rumors and accusations so as to disfigure the great shar\u2019\u012b ruling and pure prophetic Sunnah titled \u201csaby\u201d? After all this, saby becomes fornication and tasarr\u012b (taking a slave-girl as a concubine) becomes rape? If only we\u2019d heard these falsehoods from the kuff\u0101r who are ignorant of our religion. Instead we hear  it  from  those  associated  with  our  Ummah, those whose names are Muhammad, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, and \u2018Al\u012b! So I say in astonishment: Are our people awake or asleep? But what really alarmed me was that some of the Islamic State supporters (may Allah forgive them) rushed to defend the Islamic State \u2013 may its honor  persist  and  may  Allah  expand  its  territory \u2013  after  the  k\u0101fir  media  touched  upon  the  State\u2019s capture  of  the  Yaz\u012bd\u012b  women.  So  the  supporters started denying the matter as if the soldiers of the Khil\u0101fah had committed a mistake or evil.\nThus, after the matter transcended its limits and the barking of the charlatans \u2013 the wicked scholars \u2013 rose upon the pulpits of deviance, it became necessary to face their declarations with a declaration, but one \ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "AMONG THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "40"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq7-TO-OUR-SISTERS", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "would  watch  the  videos,  it  would  make  him want  to  perform  hijrah  immediately  and  that would have conflicted with his intent to carry out the operations in France.\nD\u0100BIQ: Do you have a message to the Muslims in general and Muslim sisters in particular?\nUMM BAS\u012aR: Remember {the Day when every soul  will  come  disputing  for  itself,  and  every soul will be fully compensated for what it did, and they will not be wronged} [An-Nahl: 111].\nMy  brothers  and  sisters,  I  call  on  you  to  be concerned about the condition of the Ummah in the world, to act in accordance to such while following the Qur\u2019\u0101n and Sunnah.\nAllah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) gave you minds to think with and intelligence to reason with.

Be advisors to them. They should find comfort and  peace  with  you.  Do  not  make  things difficult  for  them.  Facilitate  all  matters  for them. Be strong and brave. It is essential that you make all your deeds sincerely for Allah\u2019s face and hope for His reward. Know that the Companions  (radiyall\u0101hu  \u2018anhum)  did  not spread Islam in these vast lands except with their  righteous  wives  behind  them.  Do  not waste  your  time  and  energy  in  play,  futility, and  what  does  not  concern  you.  Learn  your religion! Learn your religion! Read the Qur\u2019\u0101n, reflect upon it, and practice it. Nourish your love of Allah and His Messenger. It is essential for you to love Allah and His Messenger more than  your  own  selves,  your  husbands,  your children, and your parents. Follow the example of \u0100siyah \u2013 the wife of Pharaoh \u2013 who left the Duny\u0101  for  Allah  and  the  Hereafter  although she  was  a  queen  and  had  the  wealth  of  the Duny\u0101.  She  was  tortured  and  killed  because of  this  choice,  but  Allah  kept  her  firm  and raised her above many women. And all praise is due to Allah, the Forgiving and Generous. Follow  the  example  of  Maryam  (\u2018alayhassal\u0101m)  in  her  chastity,  modesty,  obedience of Allah, and truthfulness, which was one of her greatest traits, and so Allah chose her and raised her above many women. And all praise is  due  to  Allah,  the  Majestic.  There  were many  righteous  women  in  history,  so  follow their example. Be patient. Patience is a great virtue. May Allah, the Bestower, provide you with patience. The life of the believer is full of trials and tribulations. So be patient while hoping for Allah\u2019s reward.

These  grizzly events, as we have seen with the Japanese and Jordanian hostages, are stage managed in order to gain maximum publicity and inspire general terror.\u201d\n\u201cIsis  has  suffered  setbacks,  but  has  also had  successes.  This  week,  its  forces  were finally  driven  out  of  the  Syrian  Kurdish  town of  Kobani  after  a  siege  lasting  134  days,  in which it suffered heavy losses from 606 US air strikes.  But  elsewhere  in  Syria,  Isis  has  been advancing towards the city of Homs as well as gaining strength south of Damascus and at alQalamoun,  close  to  eastern  Lebanon.  By  one account, Isis has won control of territory since last September where one million Syrians live, in addition to the area it already held.\u201d\n\u201cIn Iraq, government forces have made advances in  the  provinces  around  Baghdad,  but  earlier this  week  bullets  hit  a  plane  and  wounded passengers over Baghdad International Airport, forcing major airlines to stop flying there. This isolates the Iraqi capital and, though the airport is  not  completely  closed,  Isis  could  probably achieve this at any moment.\u201d\nHe then went on to say:\n\u201cAccording  to  the  International  Centre  for  the Study  of  Radicalisation  and  Political  Violence, the number of foreign fighters joining Isis in Iraq and Syria has risen from 15,000 last October to 20,000 today. A fifth of these come from Western Europe. Isis has also conscripted fighters in the territories it controls.\u201d\n\u201cIsis is being squeezed militarily and economically, but there is no sign of it imploding. Even its loss of Kobani is not necessarily a sign of weakness, since it held on for months despite fighting \u2026 [the] Syrian Kurds, backed by an intensive US air bombardment in a confined place.\u201d\nIN THE WORDS OF THE ENEMY\n\u201cWestern  analysts  are  encouraged  by  the number  of  experienced Isis  commanders killed last year, but its ideology is built around martyrdom, and the high casualty rate among leaders  shows  that  they  fight  in  the  frontline. President Obama says America\u2019s main effort is in Iraq but unless it can rebuild the Iraqi army then  it  will  be  near  impossible  to  defeat  Isis there. And so long as Isis continues, so too will high profile hostage-taking and executions.\u201d\nThe  Washington  Post  Editorial  Board  also commented on the \u201cvictories\u201d of the coalition, saying:\n\u201cA small victory in Syria is no reason to celebrate as the Islamic State gets stronger. US officials are celebrating a modest victory in the war against the  Islamic  State  in  Syria  \u2013  the  apparently successful  defense  of  the  Kurdish  town  of Kobane, on the border with Turkey. Under siege since early October, Kobane has little strategic value but came to be seen as a test of whether the United States and its allies could stop the expansion of the Islamic State \u2026 With the help of  Kurdish  ground  forces,  the  extremists  were turned  back.  But  perhaps  the  most  significant fact about Kobane is that it consumed 75 percent of  the  nearly  1,000  airstrikes  carried  out  by allied planes throughout Syria since September \u2026 In the rest of the Syrian territory it controls, including its capital of Raqqa, the Islamic State \u2026 is growing stronger rather than weaker.\u201d\nOr in the words of the crusader Eric Shawn of Fox News:\n\u201cThe president promises ISIS will be destroyed. Instead, it is only spreading \u2026 Coalition forces did  finally  beat  back  ISIS  in  the  key  border town of Kobani \u2026 It reportedly took 75 percent of  all  the  air  strikes  launched  there  so  far  to accomplish it. And despite that one glimmer of hope,  the  Islamic  state  vows  to  recapture  the town  as  it  scores  successes  elsewhere  \u2026  The Islamic state\u2019s territory has grown in the last five months \u2026 despite all of the coalition air strikes.\u201d\ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "TO OUR SISTERS", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "50"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq2", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq8-HIKMAH", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "Ras\u016blull\u0101h (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) said, \u201cAllah  (\u2018azza  wa  jall)  does  not  accept  any deed from a mushrik after he accepts Islam until he departs from the mushrik\u012bn and goes to the Muslims\u201d [Reported by Ibn M\u0101jah and an-Nas\u0101\u2019\u012b on the authority of Mu\u2019\u0101wiyah Ibn Haydah].\nThe  Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam) took  the  hand  of  Jar\u012br  Ibn  \u2018Abdill\u0101h  (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anh) and said to him, \u201cI take your bay\u2019ah (pledge) to worship Allah alone, establish the prayer, give the zak\u0101h, advise the Muslims,  and  depart  from  the  mushrik\u012bn\u201d [Reported by Im\u0101m Ahmad and an-Nas\u0101\u2019\u012b].\ndabiq\n\fAMONG THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN\nthem  for  the  Islamic  State  leadership to  officially  recognize  their  bay\u2019ah.

Consider  that  seventy  thousand  Jews  from Asbah\u0101n  (Isfahan  of  modern-day  Iran)  will  follow  the Dajj\u0101l as in the had\u012bth reported by Muslim from Anas \uf068.\nAlso consider that the Dajj\u0101l will emerge from the region of the Khaw\u0101rij as in the had\u012bth reported by Ibn M\u0101jah from Ibn \u2018Umar \uf06b. And also consider that those who deny  Qadar  are  from  the  followers  of  the  Dajj\u0101l  as  in the had\u012bth reported by Ab\u016b D\u0101w\u016bd from Hudhayfah \uf068. This is important for two reasons, the R\u0101fidah are from the  biggest  Kh\u0101rij\u012b  sects.  They  and  the  other  Khaw\u0101rij have a common root in the Jew \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn Saba\u2019, who partook  in  the  mutiny  against  the  righteous  Khal\u012bfah \u2018Uthman  \uf068.  For  this  reason,  some  of  the  scholars have also referred to the Khaw\u0101rij as \u201cSaba\u2019iyyah.\u201d3  In 2 Note that Muhammad al-B\u0101qir, Ja\u2019far as-S\u0101diq, and al-Hasan al-\u2018Askar\u012b \uf073 were not R\u0101fidah. They were from the family of the Prophet \uf067 just as \u2018Al\u012b, F\u0101timah, al-Hasan, and al-Husayn \uf06a were from the family of the Prophet \uf067. And just as the R\u0101fidah fabricated lies in the name of \u2018Al\u012b and his immediate family \uf06a, they fabricated lies in the name of his noble descendants \uf073.3 The closeness of the R\u0101fidah to the other Khaw\u0101rij is visible in the wal\u0101\u2019 between Iran\uf067 \n70,000 Jews from Asbah\u0101n will follow the Dajj\u0101l\naddition,  the  R\u0101fidah  are  infamous  for  pronouncing takf\u012br  upon  the  majority  of  the  Ummah  including  the best of the Ummah \u2013 the Companions of the Prophet \uf067 \u2013 rejecting the authority of the khulaf\u0101\u2019, even cooperating with  the  Crusaders  and  the Tatars  against  the  khulaf\u0101\u2019 and their Muslim subjects. The R\u0101fidah have a history of  massacring  Muslims  who  refuse  R\u0101fid\u012b  beliefs.  This became most manifest during the Safaw\u012b empire (\u201c15011736CE\u201d) and its war against Ahlus-Sunnah in Persia. Finally, the R\u0101fidah are one of the sects of Qadariyyah, as they deny that good and evil deeds are by Allah\u2019s qadar.\nHence  the  apostate  R\u0101fidah  combined  between  major shirk (worship of the family of the Prophet \uf067), denial of  the  Qur\u2019\u0101n  and  the  Sunnah  (as  they  claim  the Companions \uf06a fabricated the religious texts), takf\u012br of the Companions \uf06a  and the Mothers of the Believers \uf06c, and belief in the deviant innovations of the Khaw\u0101rij and Qadariyyah. When reflecting upon this and the fact that the Jews await their so-called Messiah \u2013 as the Jews deny  the  messengership  of  Jesus  \uf06e,  who  will  return before the Hour \u2013 it is expected that the R\u0101fidah will ally blatantly with the Jews in the future in their war against Islam and the Muslims.4 \nWe  seek  refuge  with  Allah  for  Ahlus-Sunnah  from  the evil of the Dajj\u0101l.\n\uf067and Oman. Oman is ruled solely and populated mostly by the Ib\u0101diyyah. The Ib\u0101diyyah are historically a deviant Kh\u0101rij\u012b sect; but over the last centuries they have mutated into an apostate Jahm\u012b sect.

Their \u201cleaders\u201d address the issue with an effort to  give  the  topic  an  \u201cIslamic\u201d  flavor,  but  typically  fall short. When tackling the issue from such a perspective, \u201cIslamic\u201d  preachers  and  writers  often  do  so  with humanistic  undertones  that  seek  to  portray  Islam  as  a religion of peace that teaches Muslims to coexist with all. Deluded by the open-ended concept of \u201ctolerance,\u201d they cite numerous \u0101y\u0101t and ah\u0101d\u012bth that \u2013 rightfully so \u2013 serve to demonstrate that racial hatred has no place in Islam, but they do so for the purpose of advancing an agenda that attempts to \u201cIslamize\u201d more \u201cliberal\u201d concepts that the  kuff\u0101r  apply  across  the  board  for  achieving  evil, such  as  political  pluralism,  freedom  of  religion  ,  and acceptance of sodomites. In doing so, these \u201cdu\u2019\u0101t\u201d seek to encourage the k\u0101fir societies they live in to be more accepting of them, rather than meeting the enmity of the mushrik\u012bn with hatred and disavowal. They forego the concept of wal\u0101\u2019 and bar\u0101\u2019 (loyalty and disavowal for the cause of Allah), not bothering to educate their readers of the Muslim\u2019s obligation to reject kufr, separate himself from the kuff\u0101r, abandon their lands, harbor enmity and hatred towards them, and wage war against them until they submit to the truth.\n{There has already been for you an excellent pattern in Ibr\u0101h\u012bm  and  those  with  him,  when  they  said  to  their people,  \u201cIndeed,  we  are  disassociated  from  you  and from whatever you worship other than Allah. We have denied you, and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone\u201d} [Al-Mumtahanah: 4].\nThe example of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \uf06e and those with him \u2013 meaning the prophets of Allah, as mentioned by the scholars of tafs\u012br \u2013 which was praised by Allah as being an excellent example  for  us  to  follow,  is  for  one  to  be  prepared  to reject his own people when they fall into kufr and shirk, and not to remain attached to them on account of tribal or blood ties. If this is the case with one\u2019s own people with whom a common lineage is shared, how much more so in the case of those with whom one shares nothing more than a superficial characteristic such as skin color!\nThus,  the  correct  way  to  approach  the  issue  of  racism from an Islamic perspective is to reassert the importance and significance of wal\u0101\u2019 and bar\u0101\u2019, and to state in clear and unequivocal terms that those who wage war against \nIslam and the Muslims will not be spared on account of their skin color or ethnicity. The fate of a k\u0101fir waging war against the Muslims is one and the same across the entire racial spectrum \u2013 slaughter.\nThe  reason  for  this  is  simple:  A  Muslim\u2019s  loyalty  is determined, not by his skin color, his tribal affiliation, or his last name, but by his faith. He loves those whom Allah loves and hates those whom Allah hates. He forges alliances for the cause of Allah and breaks relations for the cause of Allah. \nThe  mufassir  of  the  Ummah,  \u2018Abdull\u0101h  Ibn  \u2018Abb\u0101s  \uf06b said,  \u201cLove  for  the  sake  of  Allah,  hate  for  the  sake  of Allah, make allegiance for the sake of Allah, and make enemies  for  the  sake  of  Allah,  for  the  wil\u0101yah  (loving guardianship) of Allah is not attained except by this. One will  not  find  the  taste  of  \u012bm\u0101n,  even  if  his  prayer  and fasting is great, until he is like this\u201d [Reported by Ibn alMub\u0101rak in \u201cAz-Zuhd\u201d and by al-L\u0101lik\u0101\u2019\u012b].\nThis  statement  of  Ibn  \u2018Abb\u0101s  echoes  that  made  by  the Prophet  \uf067  when  declaring  wal\u0101\u2019  and  bar\u0101\u2019  to  be  the strongest bond of faith. Al-Bar\u0101\u2019 Ibn \u2018\u0100zib \uf068 said that they were sitting with the Prophet \uf067 when he \uf067 asked, \u201cWhat bond of Islam is the strongest?\u201d They said, \u201cThe prayer.\u201d He \uf067 said, \u201cIt is good, but it is not it.\u201d They said, \u201cThe zak\u0101h.\u201d He \uf067 said, \u201cIt is good, but it is not it.\u201d They said, \u201cFasting Ramad\u0101n.\u201d He \uf067 said, \u201cIt is good, but it is not it.\u201d They said, \u201cThe hajj.\u201d He \uf067 said, \u201cIt is good, but it is not it.\u201d They said, \u201cJih\u0101d.\u201d He \uf067 said, \u201cIt is good, but it is not it. Indeed, the strongest bond of Islam is to love for the sake of Allah and hate for the sake of Allah\u201d [Reported by Im\u0101m Ahmad and others].\nIt was this principle \u2013 the strongest and most firm bond of Islam \u2013 that led Ab\u016b Bakr as-Sidd\u012bq \uf068 to spend an enormous  quantity  of  wealth  in  order  to  purchase  the Ethiopian slave Bil\u0101l \uf068 and set him free. When Bil\u0101l\u2019s owner  Umayyah  ridiculed  Ab\u016b  Bakr  at  the  conclusion of the transaction stating that he would have sold him for  one  tenth  of  the  price  they\u2019d  agreed  on,  Ab\u016b  Bakr retorted that if Umayyah had demanded ten times the agreed price he would have paid it. Years later, Ab\u016b Bakr and 300 other Arabs would march forth in the Battle of Badr  alongside  the  former  Ethiopian  slave  striking  the necks of their own people. That day would be referred thereafter  as  the  Day  of  Furq\u0101n,  the  day  that  Allah divided between truth and falsehood at the hands of a people who slay and imprison their own people for the cause of Allah. No day before it made it more clear that all past affiliations were broken, leaving only one bond remaining \u2013 the bond between a believing Muslim and \ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "THE \u201cMAHD\u012a\u201d OF THE R\u0100FIDAH: THE DAJJ\u0100L", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "16"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq8", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dabiq_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq15-By-the-Sword", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "15", "schema:articleBody": "abominable practices that they have done for their gods, and so you sin against the Lord your God\u201d (Deuteronomy 20:16).And as David was quoted, saying to his enemy,  \u201cThis  day  the  Lord  will  deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head\u201d (1 Samuel 17:46), and after conquering him, he reportedly beheaded him. \u201cThen David ran and  stood  over  the  Philistine  [Goliath] and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with  it  \u2026  And  David  took  the  head  of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem \u2026 And as soon as David returned from the striking down of the Philistine, Abner took  him,  and  brought  him  before  Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand\u201d (1 Samuel 17:51-57).\nOnce the rule of the Lord was established, the sword was not to be put away but rather remain ever-unsheathed to implement the Law. The blasphemer was killed by stoning. \u201cWhoever blasphemes the name of the Lord shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him\u201d (Leviticus 24:16). As for the apostate or any who calls to worshiping other gods, then \u201cyou shall not yield to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him, nor shall you conceal him. But you shall kill him. Your hand shall be first against him to put him to death\u201d (Deuteronomy 13:8-9). Likewise, the murderer was executed.  \u201cWhoever  takes  a  human  life  shall  surely be  put  to  death\u201d  (Leviticus  24:17).  And  sodomites were slain. \u201cIf a man lies with a male as with a woman,  both  of  them  have  committed  an  abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them\u201d (Leviticus 24:13). Furthermore, there was retribution (known as \u201cqisas\u201d in the Shari\u2019ah). \u201cIf anyone injures his neighbor, as he has done it shall be done to him\u201d (Leviticus 24:19), and \u201cyou shall pay life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe\u201d (Exodus 21:23-25). In Psalms, a wisdom behind divinely-ordained killing is mentioned. \u201cWhen He killed them, they sought Him; they repented and sought  God  earnestly\u201d  (Psalms  78:34),  just  as  elsewhere in the Old Testament, one finds that \u201ccursed is he who keeps back his sword from bloodshed\u201d (Jeremiah 48:10).\nEven  Jesus,  whom  the  Christians  have  titled  the \nKilled for the abominable crime of sodomy\n\u201cPrince of Peace,\u201d is recorded in their scripture as saying, \u201cDo not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword\u201d (Matthew 10:34). There is also Jesus\u2019 order to his followers of being armed, as it is said, \u201cAnd let the one  who  has  no  sword  sell  his  cloak  and  buy  one\u201d (Luke 22:36). Also, while telling a parable, it is written that Jesus said, \u201cBut as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here  and  slaughter  them  before  me\u201d  (Luke  19:27). As for upholding the Law, then in an apparent move to command virtue and forbid vice, which is chiefly done with physical force, all four \u201cgospels\u201d mention the story of Jesus violently expelling the moneychangers from the temple. \u201cAnd Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. He said to them, \u2018It is written, \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer,\u2019 but you make it a den of robbers\u2019\u201d (Matthew  21:12-13).  Furthermore,  everything  that  was mentioned from the Old Testament of war and enforcing laws was kept, unless specifically mentioned otherwise, in the Gospel of Jesus. \u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them\u201d (Matthew 5:17).\nHowever, despite these clear references to violently applying  the  Law  of  the  Lord,  Christians  have  cast aside such commandments and instead have followed papal decrees and the sermons of priests \u2013 showing that their love for men is greater than their love for the Creator of men.

This is because the Christians, like the Jews, claim salvation is attainable by mere words with absolutely no deeds to back those words; Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) responded to the Jews by saying, {Say, \u201cHave you taken a covenant with Allah?

The Jews and Christians both declared that the mere claim of faith in their messengers was sufficient to save them from Hellfire while they abandoned the essential implications of this faith, which was for them to follow the final Prophet Muhammad (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) in both words and deeds, as he was prophesized in their scriptures.

And it\u2019s  accepted broadly in these areas by individuals now that refuse to accept the concept of secular nation-states. And ISIS has been  brilliant  in  its  pushing  out  of propaganda.  It  has  really  sold  itself to the hundreds of millions of people around  there  that  are  looking  for  a message.\u201d\nFinally,  the  American  crusader  and Virginia  state  senator  Richard  Black said the following:\n\u201cOne thing is clear, if Damascus falls, the  dreaded  black  and  white  flag  of ISIS  will  fly  over  Damascus.  Within a  period  of  months  after  the  fall  of Damascus, Jordan will fall and Lebanon will fall. With that area of expansion for the most extreme Islamists, I think you will automatically see a beginning of  a  historic  push  of  Islam  towards Europe and I think, ultimately, Europe will  be  conquered,  and  that\u2019s  why  I look at Syria as the center of gravity. That\u2019s what we used to talk about in the army war college when we would study  wars  and  the  objective.  There was  always  a  center  of  gravity  \u2013  the thing  which  would  determine  the outcome  of  the  war.  If  you  defeated the  center  of  gravity,  then  you  won. What  I  see  is  Syria  is  the  center  of gravity  for  Western  civilization.  If  it falls, then we will begin to see a very rapid  advance  of  Islam  on  Europe and I think ultimately, potentially, the collapse of all of Europe.\u201d\n58 ENEMY\u2018S WORDS\nThe American Crusader RICHARD BLACK\n\f", "schema:headline": "IRJ\u0100\u2019 THE MOST DANGEROUS BID\u2019AH", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "39"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq3-The-Islamic-State-in-the-words-of-the-enemy-", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "3", "schema:articleBody": "\u201c\nToday I authorized two operations in Iraq \u2013 targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians  who  are  trapped  on  a  mountain  without food and water, and facing almost certain death. Let me explain the actions we are taking and why. First, I  said  in  June,  as  the  terrorist  group  ISIL  began  an advance across Iraq, that the United States would be prepared  to  take  targeted  military  action  in  Iraq  if and when we determined that the situation required it. In recent days, these terrorists have continued to move across Iraq and have neared the city of Irbil, where American diplomats and civilians serve at our consulate,  and  American  military  personnel  advise Iraqi forces. To stop the advance on Irbil, I\u2019ve directed our military to take targeted strikes against ISIL terrorist convoys should they move toward the city. We intend to stay vigilant and take action if these terrorist  forces  threaten  our  personnel  or  facilities anywhere in Iraq, including our consulate in Irbil and our embassy in Baghdad. We\u2019re also providing urgent assistance  to  Iraqi  government  and  Kurdish  forces so they can more effectively wage the fight against ISIL. Second, at the request of the Iraqi government, we\u2019ve begun operations to help save Iraqi civilians stranded  on  the  mountain.  As  ISIL  has  marched across Iraq it has waged a ruthless campaign against innocent Iraqis. And these terrorists have been especially  barbaric  towards  religious  minorities,  including  Christians  and  Yazidis,  a  small  and  ancient religious sect. Countless Iraqis have been displaced and chilling reports describe ISIL militants rounding up  families,  conducting  mass  executions,  and  enslaving Yazidi women. In recent days, Yazidi women, men, and children from the area of Sinjar have fled for their lives. And thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, are now hiding high up in the mountain with little but the clothes on their backs. They\u2019re without food. They\u2019re without water. People are starving and children are dying of thirst. Meanwhile, ISIL forces below have called for the systematic destruction of the entire Yazidi people below which would constitute genocide\u2026\n\u201d\ndabiq\fsteven JoeLsotLoff\ndefeated US government turned away from their citizen with apathy.\nthe Islamic State for the safe release of American citizens?\nDuring this long 9-month period, as the American government was dragging its feet, reluctant to take the necessary steps to save James\u2019s life, negotiations were made by the governments of a number of European prisoners, which resulted in the release of a dozen of their prisoners, after the demands of the Islamic State were met. That left a number of British and American prisoners remaining in the cells of the Islamic State, only after  their  governments  arrogantly  refused  to release our imprisoned brothers and our sister, Dr. Aafia Siddiqui. \nTo paraphrase James, the Obama administration ultimately hit the last nail in James\u2019s coffin and killed him by bombing Iraq.

While its fighters defend and slowly expand IS-held  territory,  other  IS  leaders and  administrators  are  engaged  in bringing  order  and  repairing  social services  and  public  utilities  in  the areas  they  hold,  a  pattern  seen previously in Syria and Iraq.

(NB: This is not to argue that a multi-Muslimnation  intervention  by  U.S.-NATO forces is needed. First, that mother of all Western interventions would be the single most powerful ally for IS\u2019s goal of uniting the Sunni world. Second, the  U.S.  military  is  worn  out  after two  decades  of  war-losing;  is  being neutered  by  Obama\u2019s  calculatedto-destroy  budget  cuts,  manpower reductions,  and  effeminization;  and the NATO militaries \u2014 save Turkey\u2019s \u2014 are tiny, antiquated, underfunded, and  could  not  stop  Putin\u2019s  panzers from  rolling  down  the  Champs Elysees  without  using  nuclear weapons.

In this effort, IS has capitalized on what is now a decades  long  campaign,  that  began with  the  USSR\u2019s  demise,  in  which Saudi Arabia, its Gulf partners, and their  NGOs2  have  converted  large numbers  of  Balkans  Muslims  from being  nominal  believers  to  being Muslims  well-schooled  in  the  warprone Salafi and Wahhabi doctrines. The  Saudi-led  effort3  has  not  yet made the Balkans a bastion of those doctrines, but it is yielding increasing numbers  of  Balkan  Muslims  who have  become  Salafis  and  Wahhabis. These  converts  have  challenged in and succeeded in displacing  more  moderate Islamic leaders,  building  Islamist organizations  that  have  sporadically attacked  individuals,  security  forces, and buildings, and have sent a steady 2  Editor\u2019s  Note:  The  taw\u0101gh\u012bt  of  \u0100l  Sal\u016bl  and  their  allies work together to portray themselves as the caretakers of Islam and the Muslims, when in actuality they propagate deviance, lewdness, and even sodomy through their \u201cRotana Group\u201d and their other entertainment and religious outlets, never mind the fact they rule by international and domestic manmade laws and support the Jews and Christians against Islam and the Muslims.

This was in addition to a number of operations against the PKK within their main strongholds,  including  istishh\u0101di  operations  carried out against  the  PKK/Peshmerga  murtadd\u012bn  in  both Iraq and Sh\u0101m, as well as a number of PKK vehicles blown  up  by  the  Islamic  State\u2019s  undercover  cells in Wil\u0101yat Al-Barakah, all leading to many of their apostate soldiers being killed. \nMay  Allah  continue  to  humiliate  the  secularist murtadd\u012bn in all their colors and stripes.\nthe IstIshhaDI abu hafs at-tunusI\nghanImah from Zur maghar\npounDIng the pKK In Zur maghar\ndabiq\fa DIscussIon onMub\u0101halah\npart 2:\nAlhamdulill\u0101h,  the  muj\u0101hid\u012bn  have  been  the firmest in believing in the legality of mub\u0101halah. Shaykh \u2018Abdul-Kar\u012bm al-Humayd (may Allah keep him  firm  and  release  him  from  imprisonment) wrote  an  excellent  treatise  titled  \u201cAl-Mash\u0101yikh al-Judud  wa  Da\u2019watuhum  ilal  Mub\u0101halah\u201d  (The New Mash\u0101yikh and Calling Them to Mub\u0101halah) in which he clarified the proofs for the matter and called the so-called \u201cCommittee of Elder Scholars\u201d as well as Salm\u0101n al-\u2018Awdah and N\u0101sir al-\u2018Umar to a mub\u0101halah, after they repeatedly labelled the muj\u0101hid\u012bn \u201ckhaw\u0101rij\u201d and invited the Palestinians to participate in the shirk\u012b religion of democracy by voting for Hamas! The following discussion on mub\u0101halah is mostly taken from his treatise.\nThe main proof for the legality of mub\u0101halah is the verses: {Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created Him from dust; then He said to him, \u201cBe,\u201d and he was. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters. Then whoever argues with you about it after knowledge has come to you \u2013 say, \u201cCome, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women,  ourselves  and  yourselves,  then  supplicate earnestly and invoke the curse of Allah upon the liars\u201d} [\u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 59-61].\nThese  verses  were  revealed  with  regards  to  a christian  delegation  from  Najr\u0101n  that  came  to the Prophet (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) and debated him on Islam. When mub\u0101halah was proposed, the christian delegation backed out.\nAllah \u2018azza wa jall also said, {Say, \u201cWhoever is in error \u2013 let ar-Rahm\u0101n lengthen for him an extension [in time] until, when they see that which they were promised \u2013 either punishment or the Hour.\u201d They will come to know who is worst in position \nand weaker in soldiers\u201d} [Maryam: 75].\nIbn  Kath\u012br  (rahimahull\u0101h)  said  \u2013  commenting  on the verse, \u201cAllah ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101 says, {Say}, O Muhammad to these mushrik\u012bn who associate others with their Lord, who claim that they are upon the  truth and that you are upon falsehood. \n{Whoever is in error}, meaning from amongst us and amongst you. {Let ar-Rahm\u0101n lengthen for him an extension} meaning, that Allah leaves him in his condition,  until  he  meets  his  Lord  and  his  term elapses.  {Either  punishment}  afflicts  him,  {or  the Hour} comes to him suddenly. {They will come to know} then, {who is worst in position and weaker in soldiers}, meaning in contrast to their claim of good position and assembly.\u201d\n\u201cMuj\u0101hid said regarding His words: {Let ar-Rahm\u0101n lengthen  for  him  an  extension},  \u2018Let  Allah  leave him in his tyranny.\u2019 This is what Abu Ja\u2019far Ibn Jar\u012br at-Tabar\u012b (rahimahull\u0101h) ascertained.\u201d\n\u201cThis  is  the  mub\u0101halah  for  the  mushrik\u012bn  who claim  that  they  are  upon  guidance  with  regards to  their  religion,  as  Allah  ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101  also  mentioned the mub\u0101halah for the jews in His words,  {Say, \u201cO you who are jews, if you claim that you are allies of Allah, excluding the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful\u201d} [Al-Jumu\u2019ah: 6], meaning supplicate for death to befall the one upon falsehood amongst us or amongst you; if you claim that you are upon truth, then du\u2019\u0101\u2019 cannot harm you.

So everyone  who  lives  amongst  the  mushrik\u012bn while being able to perform hijrah and not being able to establish his religion, then he is wronging himself and committing sin. This is in accordance with  ijm\u0101\u2019.  Ab\u016b  D\u0101w\u016bd  reported  through  his isn\u0101d on the authority of Samurah Ibn Jundub (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anhum\u0101) that Ras\u016blull\u0101h (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  said,  \u2018Whoever  gathers  and lives with the mushrik, then he is like him.\u2019\u201d\nAlso, if there were no evidences for the obligation of  hijrah  except  the  following  ah\u0101d\u012bth  of  the Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam),  \u201cHijrah will  not  cease  as  long  as  there  is  repentance, and  repentance  will  not  cease  until  the  sun rises from the West\u201d [Reported by Ab\u016b D\u0101w\u016bd], \u201cHijrah will not cease as long as there is jih\u0101d\u201d [Reported by Im\u0101m Ahmad], \u201cI have nothing to do  with  any  Muslim  who  resides  amongst  the mushrik\u012bn\u201d  [Reported  by  Ab\u016b  D\u0101w\u016bd  and  atTirmidh\u012b], and, \u201cHijrah will not cease as long as the enemy is fought\u201d [Reported by Im\u0101m Ahmad and an-Nas\u0101\u2019\u012b], it would suffice us to refute the doubts of the doubters and the rumors of the fearmongers.\nTHE TWIN HALVES OF THE MUH\u0100JIR\u012aN\nThis ruling is an obligation upon women just as  it  is  upon  men,  for  Allah  (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101),  when excluding those incapable of performing hijrah, He excluded the incapable women just as He excluded  the  incapable  men.  Allah  (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) said,  {Except  for  the  oppressed  among  men, women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to a way \u2013 for those it is expected that Allah will pardon them, and Allah  is  ever  Pardoning  and  Forgiving}  [AnNis\u0101\u2019:  98-99].  The  Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi wa sallam) has also said, \u201cWomen are the twin halves of men\u201d [Reported by Ab\u016b D\u0101w\u016bd, atTirmidh\u012b, and Ibn M\u0101jah].\nAnd  today,  after  the  Muslims  established  a state that rules by the Qur\u2019\u0101n and the Sunnah of  the  Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam), which expanded to wide territories larger than the areas of some of the states of Sykes and Picot,  and  whose  blessed  soldiers  restored the  promised  khil\u0101fah  by  the  edge  of  the sword not through pacifism, the rate of hijrah magnified  and  now  every  day  there  are  not only  muh\u0101jir\u012bn  to  the  land  of  Islam  but  also muh\u0101jir\u0101t  who  were  sick  of  living  amongst kufr and its people.

Their colors and tongues are different, but their hearts are united upon \u201cthere is no god but Allah.\u201d I remember the day I performed hijrah, I was the only Arab woman amongst the muh\u0101jirah sisters during that trip.\nIf  speaking  about  the  muh\u0101jir\u012bn  is  amazing, then  speaking  about  their  twin  halves  the muh\u0101jir\u0101t  is  even  more  amazing!

Therefore, abandoning jih\u0101d is a trait of hypocrisy. So be wary of it or else it may seize you by your heart.\nAl-Hasan  al-Basr\u012b  (rahimahull\u0101h)  said,  \u201cNo  one fears  hypocrisy  except  a  believer,  and  no  one feels safe from it except a hypocrite\u201d [J\u0101mi\u2019 al-\u2018Ul\u016bm wal-Hikam].\nIbn  Rajab  (rahimahull\u0101h)  said,  \u201cSahl  at-Tustar\u012b said, \u2018The mur\u012bd (devout worshipper) fears being afflicted with sins, but the \u2018\u0101rif (knowledgeable  slave)  fears  being  afflicted  with  kufr.\u2019  For this reason the Sah\u0101bah and the righteous Salaf after them were afraid of nif\u0101q (hypocrisy) for themselves,  and  their  worry  of  nif\u0101q  was  severe. Therefore, the believer is afraid of minor nif\u0101q for himself, and he is afraid that such could overcome him prior to death and thus drive him into major nif\u0101q, as we mentioned before that deeply  hidden  evils  bring  about  sinful  death\u201d [J\u0101mi\u2019 al-\u2018Ul\u016bm wal-Hikam].\ndabiq\f\u201c\nToday I authorized two operations in Iraq \u2013 targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians  who  are  trapped  on  a  mountain  without food and water, and facing almost certain death. Let me explain the actions we are taking and why. First, I  said  in  June,  as  the  terrorist  group  ISIL  began  an advance across Iraq, that the United States would be prepared  to  take  targeted  military  action  in  Iraq  if and when we determined that the situation required it. In recent days, these terrorists have continued to move across Iraq and have neared the city of Irbil, where American diplomats and civilians serve at our consulate,  and  American  military  personnel  advise Iraqi forces. To stop the advance on Irbil, I\u2019ve directed our military to take targeted strikes against ISIL terrorist convoys should they move toward the city. We intend to stay vigilant and take action if these terrorist  forces  threaten  our  personnel  or  facilities anywhere in Iraq, including our consulate in Irbil and our embassy in Baghdad. We\u2019re also providing urgent assistance  to  Iraqi  government  and  Kurdish  forces so they can more effectively wage the fight against ISIL. Second, at the request of the Iraqi government, we\u2019ve begun operations to help save Iraqi civilians stranded  on  the  mountain.  As  ISIL  has  marched across Iraq it has waged a ruthless campaign against innocent Iraqis. And these terrorists have been especially  barbaric  towards  religious  minorities,  including  Christians  and  Yazidis,  a  small  and  ancient religious sect. Countless Iraqis have been displaced and chilling reports describe ISIL militants rounding up  families,  conducting  mass  executions,  and  enslaving Yazidi women. In recent days, Yazidi women, men, and children from the area of Sinjar have fled for their lives. And thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, are now hiding high up in the mountain with little but the clothes on their backs. They\u2019re without food. They\u2019re without water. People are starving and children are dying of thirst. Meanwhile, ISIL forces below have called for the systematic destruction of the entire Yazidi people below which would constitute genocide\u2026\n\u201d\ndabiq\f", "schema:headline": "Hijrah from hypocrisy to sincerity ", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "25"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq5-IN-THE-WORDS-OF-THE-ENEMY-", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "5", "schema:articleBody": "THE CRUSADER ANDREW LIEPMAN\n\u201c\nLiepman:  Dismantling,  degrading,  containing  them  [the Islamic  State] is  achievable.

In this case,  every  partner  is  problematic.  Iraqi  security  forces have  crumbled  in  recent  months.  The  Shia  militias  are problematic.  The  Sunnis  could  potentially  turn  against ISIS, but they are very wary of this new government. The Peshmurgas, the Kurdish militia, are least problematic.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to cripple the strategy, but it is a serious  hurdle. The absence of a clearly envisioned end state condition is important. What is it that we want this group that we\u2019re going to support to do after ISIS is defeated? The Free Syrian Army is the group we go to now. They\u2019ve suffered battlefield defeats. They\u2019re politically disorganized. I\u2019m not sure what they would do with the Syrian state if they were able to assume control. \nLiepman: We need to remind ourselves that the president said, as did his military commanders, that this new phase of fighting against a determined and impressive enemy, will  take  some  time.  We  need  to  be  careful  about  how we define victory. We won\u2019t vanquish this enemy. We\u2019ll be lucky to degrade ISIS.

But by doing so we have escalated the campaign against ISIS without deploying sufficient force to seriously degrade or destroy them. \nRabasa:  Airstrikes  will  have  diminishing  returns  as  ISIS adjusts.

This is the intent of all  the  verses  and  ah\u0101d\u012bth  that  order  and  guide towards  appointing  an  im\u0101m  and  khal\u012bfah,  like the  hadith,  \u201cThen  there  will  be  khil\u0101fah  upon the  prophetic  methodology,\u201d  and  the  had\u012bth narrated by Hudhayfah \uf068 \u201cStick to the jam\u0101\u2019ah of the Muslims and their im\u0101m,\u201d and the hadith \u201cIf bay\u2019ah is given to two khulaf\u0101\u2019, then kill the second of the two,\u201d and the other texts that are about  the  rules  regarding  the  general  im\u0101m  or khal\u012bfah  who  deserves  this  description  having fulfilled the conditions and qualifications for it, as in the case of the khil\u0101fah of the four Rightly Guided Khulaf\u0101\u2019, as well as al-Hasan Ibn \u2018Al\u012b Ibn Ab\u012b T\u0101lib, Mu\u2019\u0101wiyah Ibn Ab\u012b Sufy\u0101n, \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn az-Zubayr \uf06a and the khilafah of \u2018Umar Ibn \u2018Abdil-\u2018Az\u012bz r, and others [from the Umaw\u012b and \u2018Abb\u0101s\u012b khulaf\u0101\u2019].\nAnd it might be the case that the im\u0101m or am\u012br is specific to some region or land, then he would be  a  territorial  leader  whose  authority  does  not exceed his territory, as the historians mentioned that  when  the  khal\u012bfah  of  the  time  Mu\u2019\u0101wiyah Ibn Yaz\u012bd died in 64AH, the people of Damascus appointed ad-Dahh\u0101k Ibn Qays as a leader to look after their affairs until the general im\u0101m is given bay\u2019ah.  This  kind  of  leadership  is  not  allowed except in cases of necessity and when the general im\u0101mah  is  dissolved.  This  is  done  to  fill  the political and shar\u2019\u012b gap and to establish whatever is  possible  from  the  laws  of  the  Shar\u012b\u2019ah.  Many scholars  of  shar\u2019\u012b  governance  have  mentioned such  appointments  in  such  situations,  like  alJuwayn\u012b  in  his  prized  book  \u201cGiy\u0101th  al-Umam,\u201d in which he said, \u201cThe purpose of im\u0101mah is the betterment of the condition of the general public, planning the affairs, and protecting the frontiers.\u201d\n\u201cTherefore,  if  appointing  a  single  im\u0101m  whose orders  are  executed  is  possible,  then  there  is  no doubt  that  this  is  best  in  accordance  with  the requisites  of  governance.  If  this  is  not  possible, it is not correct to leave and neglect the people whom the im\u0101m\u2019s supervision does not reach, as there  will  be  no  leader  to  gather  them  nor  any deterrent  to  prevent  them  from  evil.  So  they have to appoint ministers to whom they turn for leadership.  If  they  remain  leaderless,  they  will perish, and this is obvious and unpreventable.\u201d\nIf not for the absence of the Khil\u0101fah before, there would  not  have  been  a  shar\u2019\u012b  justification  for those territorial leaderships or small groups to be formed and remain. Accordingly, it is obligatory to  appoint  a  single  im\u0101m  and  khal\u012bfah  for  the Ummah who will govern the people in accordance with  Allah\u2019s  religion  and  make  them  follow  the laws  of  the  Shar\u012b\u2019ah.  This  is  because  khil\u0101fah  is similar to the case of water for wud\u016b\u2019, which is the  default,  and  those  territorial  leaderships  are like tayammum, which is an alternative allowed when necessary. And when the default is available, the  alternative  is  unaccepted.  Therefore,  when the  khal\u012bfah  is  appointed,  all  other  pledges  of allegiance  and  leaderships  outside  of  it  become void. That is why al-Juwayn\u012b said after his above statement, \u201cIf the obstacles are removed and the im\u0101m is able to supervise those people, the leader and his subjects must obey the im\u0101m and submit to  him  in  peace.  The  im\u0101m  should  accept  their excuses  and  govern  their  affairs.  If  he  decides to  approve  the  appointment  of  whom  they  had appointed, he can do so. And if he sees it best to change  him,  then  his  opinion  is  to  be  followed and they must return to his decision.\u201d\nIf this is understood and the difference between these  realities  becomes  obvious,  the  answer  to the  question  posed  becomes  clear  through  the just  and  precise  description  of  the  im\u0101mah  of Shaykh  Ab\u016b  Bakr  al-Husayn\u012b  al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b  and the leadership of Mull\u0101 \u2018Umar, since one cannot decide  on  a  matter  until  the  whole  picture  is understood.  Accordingly, the  declarations, statements,  conducts,  and  nature  of  Mull\u0101 \u2018Umar\u2019s leadership shows without a doubt that it \ndabiq\n\fThe  Expeditions  the  Prophet  Dispatched  in Ramad\u0101n\nThe  definition  of  a  ghazwah  is  a  battle  in  which the Prophet \uf067 went out with his companions and himself led the battle. A sariyyah on the other hand is one he was not present in and did not lead. The total  number  of  sar\u0101y\u0101  he  dispatched  was  73,  11 of which were sent out in the month of Ramad\u0101n. These 11 are the following:\n1) The Sariyyah of S\u0101hil al-Bahr: This occurred in the Ramad\u0101n of the first year after the Hijrah. It was  the  first  expedition  dispatched  in  Islam.  The Prophet  \uf067  appointed  Hamzah  \uf068  as  its  leader and  sent  him  with  30  men  from  the  Muh\u0101jir\u012bn. They went out to face a trade caravan belonging to Quraysh that had come from Sh\u0101m. They reached S\u012bf Al-Bahr, an area on the coast of the Red Sea, facing  the  kuffar  and  preparing  rows  for  battle. Majd\u012b Ibn \u2018Amr al-Juhan\u012b who was an ally of both sides, came between the two sides and as a result they did not fight.\n2) The Sariyyah of \u2018Umayr Ibn \u2018Ad\u012b al-Khitm\u012b: This occurred in the Ramad\u0101n of the second year after the Hijrah. The Prophet \uf067 dispatched this expedition to  kill  \u2018Asm\u0101\u2019  Bint  Marw\u0101n,  a  woman  who  used to insult Islam and incite against the Prophet \uf067. \u2018Umayr Ibn \u2018Ad\u012by al-Khitm\u012b came to her house at night and placed his sword on her chest, applying pressure until he had carried it through to her back.\n3)  The  Sariyyah  of  Zayd  Ibn  H\u0101rithah:  In  the Ramad\u0101n  of  the  sixth  year  after  the  Hijrah,  the Prophet  \uf067  dispatched  an  expedition  for  Ban\u016b Faz\u0101rah in a region of al-Qur\u0101 Valley. The reason was that men from Ban\u016b Faz\u0101rah had intercepted a trade caravan belonging to the Muslims and looted it. Zayd Ibn H\u0101rithah left for them while heading a troop of the Prophet\u2019s companions. They reached them in the morning and surrounded them and took Umm Qirfah F\u0101timah Bint Rab\u012b\u2019ah al-Faz\u0101riyyah. She  was  an  old  woman  venerated  and  obeyed  by her people. She had prepared 40 cavaliers from her sons and her son\u2019s sons to kill the Prophet \uf067. The noble companion Zayd Ibn H\u0101rithah killed them all including Umm Qirfah.\n4) The Sariyyah of \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn \u2018At\u012bk: This occurred in the Ramad\u0101n of the sixth year after the Hijrah. The tribes of al-\u2018Aws and Khazraj used to compete in  their  defense  of  the  Prophet  \uf067.  So  when  the \u2018Aws killed Ka\u2019b Ibn al-Ashraf, who used to cause the  Prophet  \uf067  harm,  the  Khazraj  searched  for someone who was similar to him in opposition to the Messenger of Allah \uf067 . They found their target in Ab\u016b R\u0101fi\u2019 Sal\u0101m Ibn Ab\u012b Haq\u012bq an-Nadr\u012b. He was the one who gathered the parties on the day of the Khandaq (Trench) and prepared the Ghataf\u0101n tribe to fight the Messenger of Allah \uf067. He would also disparage Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 in the various gatherings. The Khazraj from the Sah\u0101bah sought permission from the Prophet \uf067 to kill Ab\u016b R\u0101fi\u2019. He gave them permission so they sent five of their members  with  \u2018Abdullah  Ibn  \u2018At\u012bk  leading  them. The sariyyah raided the house of Ab\u016b R\u0101fi\u2019, killed him, and returned.\n5) The Sariyyah of Gh\u0101lib al-Layth\u012b: In the Ramad\u0101n of the seventh year after the Hijrah, the Prophet \uf067 sent this detachment to Ban\u016b \u2018Uw\u0101l and to Ban\u016b \u2018Abd Ibn Tha\u2019labah, two tribes from the Bedouins of Najd. The men of the two tribes used to conduct raids  on  the  outskirts  of  al-Mad\u012bnah  whilst  the Muslims  were  pre-occupied  with  their  battles against Quraysh and the Jews. Under the leadership of Gh\u0101lib al-Layth\u012b, 130 fighters from the Muslims marched towards them. They attacked them at the time of Fajr and killed everyone who stood against them.  The  remaining  fled.  They  seized  livestock and sheep from them which they took back to alMad\u012bnah.\n6)  The  Sariyyah  of  Ab\u016b  Qat\u0101dah  as-Salam\u012b:  This occurred in the Ramad\u0101n of the eighth year after the Hijrah. This was at the time that the Prophet \uf067 contemplated attacking Makkah. He sent Ab\u016b Qat\u0101dah  as-Salam\u012b  with  8  others  to  Batn  Idam (a valley north of Makkah). This was in order to trick Quraysh with regards to the true goal of the Muslims, and make them think that the Muslims were  targeting  that  area  and  not  Makkah.  The sariyyah reached the target without facing anything and so departed, joining up with the Muslim army.\n7)  The  Sariyyah  of  Kh\u0101lid  Ibn  al-Wal\u012bd:  This \ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "A FATW\u0100 FOR KHUR\u0100S\u0100N", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "18"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq10-THE-LAW-OF-ALLAH-OR-THE-LAWS-OF-MEN", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "The Shar\u012b\u2019ah court in ad-D\u0101n\u0101 after being assaulted by the treacherous Sahw\u0101t\nAfter that, Allah blessed Sh\u0101m and its people by repelling and reversing the Sahwah Coalition\u2019s plot and by granting the Islamic State authority in  the  blessed  land  of  Sh\u0101m  and strengthening  its  religion  \u2013  the religion of the cheerful warrior \uf067 \u2013 in ar-Raqqah, al-Barakah, al-Khayr, Halab, Hims, and elsewhere. Then the conquests expanded in the east, thus  \u2018Ir\u0101q  was  liberated  in  Mosul, al-Anbar,  al-Fall\u016bjah,  Sal\u0101hudd\u012bn, Kark\u016bk  and  elsewhere.  And  its soldiers continue to hope for Allah\u2019s further  support  and  the  conquest of Constantinople and Rome.\nCoalition  and  its  councils  to  fail.  It  conquered some of the towns and villages in Sh\u0101m, like al-B\u0101b, I\u2019z\u0101z, ad-D\u0101n\u0101, and others which used to be ruled by the Nusayr\u012b regime and then by the resistant parties  like  the  Free  Syrian  Army  and  its  allies who resisted the Shar\u012b\u2019ah and its rulings. Thus, the Islamic State ruled those towns and villages with what Allah had sent down on His Messenger \uf067, established in them the hud\u016bd, commanded the good,  forbade  the  evil,  and  judged  between  the people by the Shar\u012b\u2019ah.\nTherefore,  the  groups  of  apostates,  hypocrites, innovators,  corruption  spreaders,  rebels,  and partisans  \u2013  having  diverse  hearts  but  allied  to one  another  \u2013  thought,  evaluated,  plotted, collaborated amongst each other, and all of them participated in the concocted treachery\u2026 A few supposedly \u201cneutral\u201d groups remained outside of this coalition, like a confused lamb, neither with this side nor the other, and Allah\u2019s help is sought.\nIn  the  beginning,  the  wicked  Sahwah  Coalition in  Sh\u0101m  consisted  of  \u201cJaysh  al-Muj\u0101hid\u012bn,\u201d  the \u201cIslamic Front,\u201d \u201cJabhat Thuw\u0101r S\u016briy\u0101,\u201d the Free Syrian Army, and the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front.11 Entering into a coalition is by cooperating with it on its aim. It is not a condition that the party signs a membership paper to join the coalition. Also, some of the jih\u0101d claimants persist on blatantly lying, claiming that the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front did not partake in the Sahwah. So what is then \u201cMajlis Sh\u016br\u0101 Muj\u0101hid\u012b ash-Sharqiyyah\u201d (Mishmish)? And what is \u201cLiw\u0101\u2019 Thuww\u0101r ar-Raqqah\u201d? (They were the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front\u2019s branch in Wil\u0101yat ar-Raqqah until the 16th of Jum\u0101d\u0101 al- \u0100khirah 1435, more than three months after the beginning of the Sahwah. They are the soldiers of the Syrian called \u201cAb\u016b Sa\u2019d al-Hadram\u012b.\u201d Now they are fighting in \u2018Ayn al-Isl\u0101m and Tall Abyad in one rank together with the Kurdish atheists while shielded by American air cover.)\uf067\nThe Islamic State did not conquer a city or village after this malicious plot except that it ruled it by the Shar\u012b\u2019ah of Allah. When the parties of deviance in ar-Raqqah consisting of \u201cAhr\u0101r ash-Sh\u0101m\u201d and the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front (or what is now known now as \u201cLiw\u0101\u2019  Thuww\u0101r  ar-Raqqa\u201d)  plotted  against  the muh\u0101jir\u012bn and ans\u0101r in it and acted treacherously against them, the muwahhid muj\u0101hid\u012bn expelled them  from  it,  humiliated.  Then  they  spread the  authority  of  the  Shar\u012b\u2019ah  over  the  complete wil\u0101yah.  They  enforced  prayer,  collected  zakah, and founded the Hisbah to command good and forbid evil. They executed the hud\u016bd, judged in their courts by what Allah revealed, returned the rights  of  the  oppressed,  fought  the  kuff\u0101r  and apostates,  and  enforced  the  jizyah  upon  AhlulKit\u0101b. Thus, ar-Raqqah witnessed what it had not witnessed before from the rulings of the Shar\u012b\u2019ah. Likewise  was  the  case  of  the  other  cities  and \uf067Indeed all the people of Halab know the role that the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front played in the Sahwah Coalition, since the interrogators in the Sahw\u0101t\u2019s prisons were security officers from the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front. And if a muh\u0101jir wanted safety, the Sahwah Coalition used to order him to surrender himself to the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front. And this was all done in cooperation with other factions from the Sahwah Coalition as \u201c\u2018Amr al-Halab\u012b\u201d mentioned in the first days of the Sahwah on the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front\u2019s favorite TV channel: AlJazeera\u2026One of the former members of Jawl\u0101n\u012b\u2019s \u201csh\u016br\u0101\u201d council who returned to the Islamic State\u2019s ranks informed us that Jawl\u0101n\u012b informed them in a gathering two weeks before the launching of the Sahwah plot, that the parties had agreed upon waging war against the Islamic State soon and that he had attended the gathering in which the decision was made. When he asked Jawl\u0101n\u012b about his front\u2019s role in that, Jawl\u0101n\u012b mentioned that he had pledged to cover the frontlines with the regime that would be weakened by this plot. (For details, read the interview with the brother in this issue of D\u0101biq.)So the wicked one knew with certainty what was concocted against the Islamic State and he promised to protect the backs of the factions, allowing them to launch their war against the Islamic State. He thereby made sure that the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front would stay far from the foreground and thus present itself as neutral \u201conly\u201d defending the frontlines against the Nusayr\u012b regime, frontlines which the Islamic State was occupied from protecting after the factions stabbed it in the back. Even the image of neutrality, he quickly cast it off and entered as a major player in the wicked Sahwah plot, as his front fought the Islamic State directly or by betraying its soldiers, luring them to imprisonment, and stripping them of their arms.\ndabiq\n\fThe City of Al-Mukalla in Yemen, where al-Q\u0101i\u2019dah made no effort to implement the Shar\u012b\u2019ah after taking over\npresence of the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front in this coalition.  This  is  from  the  mutual \u201cpragmatism\u201d between the American administration  and the  Sahwah Coalition  containing  the  Jawl\u0101n\u012b front. \u201cDo not rule by the Shar\u012b\u2019ah so that  we  strike  your  enemies.\u201d  \u201cHalt operations  against  the  crusaders  or else we will bombard you.\u201d It is the politics of the carrot and stick.\ntheir  brothers \nThis  might  be  the  beginning  of  the implementation of proposals made by crusader think tanks, some of which were quoted in the last issue of D\u0101biq, in the section titled \u201cIn the Words of the Enemy.\u201d The matter might have depended  on  the  crusaders\u2019  killing of leaders  in  al-Q\u0101\u2019idah  so  that the  organization  submits  fearfully alongside the T\u0101lib\u0101n emirate to American politics. Now just as the T\u0101lib\u0101n do not pose a threat towards the safety and security of the crusader homeland, al-Q\u0101\u2019idah no longer poses a threat. This became the case after Dhaw\u0101hir\u012b adopted new policies opposing the policies of the muj\u0101hid Shaykh Us\u0101mah Ibn L\u0101din r. So Dhaw\u0101hir\u012b made the crusader lands secure, the taw\u0101gh\u012bt secure, the post-\u201cArab  Spring\u201d  taw\u0101gh\u012bt  secure, the  Ikhw\u0101n\u012b  taw\u0101gh\u012bt  secure,  the \nin \narmies  of  apostasy  secure,  and  the R\u0101fid\u012b mobs and savages secure [As in the Jawl\u0101n\u012b interview with AlJazeera and  as  in  \u201cGeneral  Guidelines  for Jih\u0101d\u012b Action\u201d by Dhaw\u0101hir\u012b].\nthe \nRather  the  matter  surpassed  even this  to  the  point  that  the  \u201cclearcut  maslahah  (interest)\u201d  was in abandoning implementation of  the  Shar\u012b\u2019ah  and  its  laws!  A \u201cpragmatic\u201d policy, or so the crusaders claim. The New York Times also said on \u201c9 June 2015\u201d in an article titled \u201cAl Qaeda Tries a New Tactic to Keep Power: Sharing It,\u201d \u201cAfter they routed the army in southern Yemen, fighters from Al Qaeda stormed into the city of  Al  Mukalla,  seizing  government buildings,  releasing  jihadists  from prison  and stealing  millions  of dollars from the central bank. Then they surprised  everyone.  Instead of  raising  their  flags  and  imposing Islamic law, they passed control to a civilian council and gave it a budget to pay salaries, import fuel and hire teams  to  clean  up  garbage.  The fighters receded into the background, maintaining  only  a  single  police station to arbitrate disputes\u2026\u201d\n\u201c[The]  branches  [of  Al  Qaeda]  in \nYemen and Syria are now increasingly making  common  cause  with  local groups on the battlefield\u2026\u201d \n\u201cAl  Qaeda\u2019s  branches  in  Syria  and Yemen  have  taken  a  different  route [from  the  Islamic  State],  building ties with local groups and refraining from the strict application of Shariah, the  legal  code  of  Islam,  when  faced with  local  resistance,  according  to residents  of  areas  where  Al  Qaeda holds  sway.  When  Al  Qaeda  took over  Al  Mukalla  in  April,  it  seized government  buildings  and  used trucks  to  cart  off  more  than  $120 million from the central bank \u2026 But it  soon  passed  control  to  a  civilian council,  giving  it  a  budget  of  more than  $4  million  to  provide  services, an  arrangement  that  made  sense  to local  officials  seeking  to  serve  their people during wartime. \u2018We are not Qaeda stooges,\u2019 said Abdul-Hakeem bin Mahfood, the council\u2019s secretary general,  in  a  telephone  interview. \u2018We formed the council to avoid the destruction  of  the  city.\u2019  While  the council  pays  salaries  and  distributes fuel,  Al  Qaeda  maintains  a  police station  to  settle  disputes,  residents said.

Ab\u016b Zakariyy\u0101 Ahmad ar-Ruways\u012b (may Allah accept him) helped the two  brothers  in  executing  the  operation.  Our brother  Ahmad  ar-Ruways\u012b  was  killed  recently in a battle against the apostates. He had been imprisoned in Tunis for issues from his past, and alhamdulill\u0101h,  Allah  guided  him  in  prison  and his practice became good. He began making the adh\u0101n in prison and attending the lessons given by  the  brothers  despite  the  harassment  from the taw\u0101gh\u012bt. When the revolution happened in Tunisia, he was able to escape with the brothers from prison. He then joined the brothers in Libya and took part in some battles with the brothers. When we established a training camp in Libya, he  became  one  of  the  brothers  in  charge  of the  camp.  He  would  train  the  brothers,  as  he excelled in the military field. Thereafter, when we started smuggling arms into Tunisia, he helped us despite having a 15-year prison sentence on him  in  Tunisia.  The  brother  did  not  hesitate. He came with us, took the risk, and smuggled \nTHE MURTADD CHOKRI BELAID\n\fDempsey,  chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff, confessed  on  television  that  \u201cfirstly,  there\u2019s  no military-only solution to ISIL. And secondly, there\u2019s no airpower alone solution either in Iraq or Syria.\u201d\nTHE TWO CRUSADERS HAGEL AND DEMPSEY\nThere\u2019s  no  point  including  quotations  from  the world\u2019s journalists because so many of them wax lyrical about the gains and exploits of the Islamic State \u2013 we\u2019d be here all day paraphrasing other peoples\u2019 words. \nBut  such  admissions  were  impossible  to  even imagine back in the days when American leaders were  busy  laying  the  groundwork  for  this  very environment  today.  Back  then,  it  was  all  about crushing  the  unruly  \u201cterrorists\u201d  in  Iraq  and Afghanistan with \u201cshock and awe\u201d and the might of  the  American  war  machine.  But  today  the men in charge are being forced to concede that maybe, just perhaps, they were a little too quick off the mark to dismiss the Islamic State as merely \u201ca terrorist organization, pure and simple.\u201d And that\u2019s just three months into their campaign.\nI  am  certainly  no  expert  on  such  matters  and my  views  are  those  of  a  layman,  but  generally one doesn\u2019t expect a mere \u201corganization\u201d to lay siege  to  cities  or  have  their  own  police  force. You certainly don\u2019t expect a mere \u201corganization\u201d to  have  tanks  and  artillery  pieces,  an  army  of soldiers tens of thousands strong, and their own spy drones. And one certainly doesn\u2019t expect a mere \u201corganization\u201d to have a mint with plans to \nPARADIGM SHIFT\nproduce their own currency, primary schools for the young, and a functioning court system.\nThese, surely, are all hallmarks of (whisper it if you dare) a country.\nAh,  the  C-word.  It\u2019s  being  used  sporadically  by the media, slowly at first but its use is gathering pace. Could the Islamic State, the Caliphate that was only announced in June, really be a country?\n\u201cISIS will have taken more towns, more territory, consolidated  more  gains  and  really  become, unfortunately, the kind of country we don\u2019t want to  see  over  there,\u201d  declared  retired  Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cowan on Fox News in October 2014.\nAs uncomfortable as it may be for many in the West, there\u2019s little reason why the State shouldn\u2019t be considered a country. Countries can be born in days, in hours during a coup, or in minutes at the signing of a paper, they have been for centuries. So there\u2019s no reason this one shouldn\u2019t have been born the way it was. And if it\u2019s not the Islamic State\u2019s country, then just whose is it?\nCertainly, it no longer belongs to Bashar al-Asad, holed up in Damascus as his soldiers recuperate after  four  years  of  massacring  the  Muslims  of Syria.  There  was  never  any  legitimacy  to  his tyrannical rule and what control he had has long passed and can never return.\nDoes  it  then  belong  to  the  newly  instated  and incompetent  puppet  Iraqi  government,  tucked away in Baghdad while its army licks its wounds from the murderous thrashing it received from the muj\u0101hid\u012bn back in the summer? Clearly not. And it definitely doesn\u2019t belong to the Free Syrian Army, who had years to do something decisive or cohesive but chose instead to smoke Gauloises cigarettes, drink tea, and complain that nothing could be done without NATO jets flying overhead. Well they are now, and they\u2019ve still achieved zero.\nNo indeed.

Since most countries choose to negotiate, either above or below the table (and everyone chooses to deal below), then by being the hardliner who does not agree to talk, all you\u2019re doing is condemning your imprisoned citizens to death. Nothing more. You\u2019re not making a big political stand because the whole thing\u2019s invisible and not in the media, you\u2019re not  showing  the  world  how  tough  you  are  for  the same reasons, in fact you\u2019re not making any difference to the global position on hostage-taking whatsoever.

The Islamic State pumps millions of dollars a day in oil revenue so they don\u2019t even need the proceeds from ransoms and haven\u2019t for quite some time. I don\u2019t claim to speak for them, but I believe it\u2019s reasonable to say that the muj\u0101hid\u012bn continue to seek ransoms only to uphold an order dictated in the Qur\u2019\u0101n. {When you meet those \nwho  disbelieve,  strike  their  necks  until,  when  you have inflicted slaughter upon them, then secure their bonds, and either confer favor afterwards or ransom them until the war lays down its burdens} [Muhammad: 4].\nMake no mistake about it, the muj\u0101hid\u012bn follow the  Qur\u2019\u0101n  to  the  letter,  say  what  they  mean,  and mean what they say. They don\u2019t play games, a fact that was not lost on the European countries whose citizens were prisoners. America, on the other hand, chose to glibly ignore the disaster that was coming their way and today spends more in one day of dropping bombs over the Islamic State as it would have taken to get 26 year-old Kayla Mueller home. Thanks to US policy at the time, all her family got instead was evidence that she was killed by a coalition bomb in ar-Raqqah and a candlelight vigil at their hometown of Prescott, Arizona.\nSo a few months back I watched with interest a 27-minute documentary entitled \u201cThe Cost of Living\u201d that was aired on ABC Australia last June. The presenter of the program, Jonathan Holmes, interviewed one  of  my  former  cellmates,  Frenchman  Nicholas Henin. Nic was a peculiar fish but I rather enjoyed his company because he was quiet and said completely weird things. One of my favourite Nic-isms was when he got a sound thrashing from a guard for throwing bread down the toilet and he announced to the room in a high-pitched voice, who had just watched him sail past the door on his head before getting a pretty decent one-two in front of all of us, that \u201cI have just been beeeeeee-ten!\u201d Ah, such happy days.\nWhen  they  got  home  the  four  French  went  on \nNicholas Henin\n\fAttacks continue\nof its operations to other regions. The terrorist attacks carried out in the final months of 2015 demonstrate that it is capable of committing attacks on\u2026targets outside the territories under its control. The extent of its reach was notably demonstrated by the suicide bombings in Beirut on 12 November 2015, the coordinated attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015 and the attacks in Jakarta by an ISIL affiliate on 14 January 2016, which closely resembled the Paris attacks\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe recent expansion of the ISIL sphere of influence across West and North Africa, the Middle East and South and South-East Asia demonstrates  the  speed  and  scale  at  which the gravity of the threat has evolved in just 18 months. The complexity of the recent attacks and  the  level  of  planning,  coordination  and sophistication  involved  raise  concerns  about its  future  evolution.  Moreover,  other  terrorist  groups\u2026are  sufficiently  attracted  by  its underlying  ideology  to  pledge  allegiance  to its so-called caliphate and self-proclaimed caliph. ISIL has also benefited from the arrival of a steady stream of foreign terrorist fighters, who continue to leave their communities to replenish its ranks. The return of these fighters from the battlefields of Iraq and the Syrian Arab  Republic  and  other  conflict  zones  is  a further  major  concern,  as  returnees  can  extend the presence of ISIL to their States of origin and use their skills and combat experience \nto recruit additional sympathizers, establish terrorist networks and commit terrorist acts\u2026\u201d\nThe report then goes on to detail how the Khil\u0101fah implements the Shar\u012b\u2019ah of zak\u0101h, da\u2019wah, jih\u0101d, jizyah, hisbah, slavery, and hud\u016bd \u2013 referring to all these laws with terms of mockery \u2013 and how this Shar\u012b\u2019ah poses a threat to \u201cinternational peace and security,\u201d AKA the \u201cnew world order.\u201d Instead of yielding by realizing that the Khil\u0101fah is here to stay and will continue ruling by the Shar\u012b\u2019ah and terrorizing its enemies, he recommended the following to the taw\u0101gh\u012bt of the divided \u201cUnited Nations\u201d:\n\u201cThe resolution of ongoing conflicts, including the Syrian conflict, would have a direct impact on the driving forces behind the recruitment of foreign terrorist fighters by ISIL \u2026 In order to address the grave threat posed by ISIL, including the influx of foreign terrorist fighters to Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic and ISIL\u2019s extensive financing activities, it is essential to identify a political resolution to the Syrian conflict. This process will require sustained and determined international commitment and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), which sets out a path towards formal intra-Syrian negotiations on a political transition process pursuant to the 2012 Geneva communiqu\u00e9 and a parallel nationwide ceasefire.\u201d\nAnd  thus,  after  the  Riyadh  Conference  of  the  Saudi  t\u0101gh\u016bt concluded, the Nusayriyyah and their atheist allies in the Democratic Forces of Syria \u2013 with Russian support and American consent  \u2013  blitzkrieged  across  regions  held  by  the  murtadd  sahw\u0101t, taking many major cities and towns through mere \u201cnegotiations\u201d with sahwah leaders who were part of the conspiracy to achieve \u201ca political resolution to the Syrian conflict.\u201d\nIs it not time the naive soldiers of the sahwah realize the evil of the plot in which they have served, repent from their apostasy, and join the ranks of the Khil\u0101fah?\n\f", "schema:headline": "The Blood of Shame", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "52"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq15-Interview", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "15", "schema:articleBody": "Christian paganism is widespread in Trinidad and Tobago\nknowledge of only the first two commandments gave me the understanding that what they were practicing was not in line with the truth. At this point, I didn\u2019t consider myself part of any of the Christian denominations, but that was as far as I got.\nIn school, I was exposed to all the various religions but I remained upon what I knew. When I was around twenty years old, I would come to accept the religion of truth, Islam. I was working at a call center and got to  know  a  Muslim  co-worker  there.  We  happened to share many of the same worldly interests, and for this  reason,  I  would  spend  much  time  with  him.  I used to ask him many questions about the religion. In our conversations I would ask him about the beliefs of Muslims, and would also ask him about Jesus and Muhammad, and everything he told me made sense to  me  and  was  in  line  with  what  I  remembered  of the first two commandments, so I quickly gravitated towards Islam and soon found myself debating Christians because I knew their beliefs were corrupt.\nSometimes, because I was drawn to Islam, when I saw him praying, I would pray like him, and when I did, I would feel very calm afterwards. I accompanied him to the Friday sermon a couple of times to see what it was about, and then became certain that this was the true religion \u2013 the religion of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. In the last conversation we had before  I  embraced  Islam,  I  told  him  that  I  was  planning on selling drugs to support my family. He said that this was wrong and that the ends don\u2019t justify the means. So I replied, \u201cYou tell me that in Islam I can kill people but I can\u2019t sell drugs to feed my family?\u201d He then began explaining to me the ultimate purpose \nof jihad as well as enlightening me concerning some of the Muslims\u2019 plights, and after the conversation, I was settled. So I declared the testimony of faith and became a Muslim.\nDabiq: How did you find the da\u2019wah to jihad?\nAbu Sa\u2019d at-Trinidadi: There was a faction of Muslims in Trinidad that was known for \u201cmilitancy.\u201d Its members  attempted  to  overthrow  the  disbelieving government but quickly surrendered, apostatized, and participated in the religion of democracy, demonstrating that they weren\u2019t upon the correct methodology of jihad. In my case, like so many other Muslims in the West, the da\u2019wah to jihad took hold of me through the lectures of Shaykh Anwar al-\u2018Awlaqi \uf08a. After listening  to  his  various  lectures  repeatedly,  I  gained  a firmer  understanding  of  what  we  as  Muslims  were supposed to be doing.\nI listened to his lecture series titled \u201cConstants on the Path of Jihad\u201d and his lecture series on \u201cThe Book of Jihad.\u201d By Allah\u2019s grace, there was a man of sound knowledge who I was able to refer to and who would answer  any  questions  I  had.  His  name  was  Shaykh Ashmead Choate and he had studied hadith and graduated from one of the Islamic colleges in the Middle East. He \uf08a made hijrah to the Islamic State and attained martyrdom fighting in Ramadi.\nDabiq: Tell us about your jihad endeavor in Trini-\ndad and Tobago.\nAbu Sa\u2019d at-Trinidadi: I, along with my brothers in \n\fShaykh \u2018Umar ash-Shishani \uf08a\nsar\u201d under the leadership of Shaykh \u2018Umar ash-Shishani \uf08a before subsequently joining the ranks of the Islamic State a few months later, after Shaykh \u2018Umar gave bay\u2019ah to Amirul-Muminin Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi \uf085.\nWhen the two brothers initially arrived in the Levant, they were eager to do their training and head out to the battlefield. At the time, the mujahidin were preparing for a major operation in Hamah, so the two brothers headed out along with the rest of their battalion, leaving their base in \u2018Anadan in the Aleppo countryside and remaining stationed in Hamah in preparation for the operation. They had to exercise patience during this period as they awaited their opportunity to  fight  and  attain  martyrdom.  For  Abu  \u2018Abdillah, however, that opportunity would be delayed as he and a number of other mujahidin in their battalion were sent back to \u2018Anadan to guard their base, look after the families of the mujahidin who were in Hamah, and receive any new muhajirin joining the battalion. He  gracefully  accepted  this  decision  and  reminded the brothers with him that Allah was testing their patience and that soon their opportunity to fight would come. What helped keep him firm then as well as in the  face  of  many  other  difficult  circumstances  was that  Abu  \u2018Abdillah  would  regularly  recall  there  was wisdom behind Allah\u2019s decrees.\nAs such, he remained patient even though his op-\nportunity  to  perform  ribat  (frontier  guarding)  and take part in battles against the enemies of Allah would come  much  later  due  to  his  medical  condition.  He had a blood disorder, which made it difficult for him to take part in any activities that could lead to strenuous or stressful circumstances. However, just as his brother had refused to let his asthma get in the way of fighting for the cause of Allah, so too did Abu \u2018Abdillah refuse to let his condition prevent him from doing the same. They had both struggled to perform hijrah despite their conditions, and were not about to give up after reaching the point they had come to. Thus, Abu Ibrahim performed ribat and also took part in a number of battles, both in Aleppo and Hamah, and Abu \u2018Abdillah waited patiently until his opportunity to perform ribat and fight finally came a few months after the start of the Sahwah in the Levant. During this period of waiting and preparation, Abu \u2018Abdillah would contribute to the efforts of the mujahidin by taking on other roles.\nHis brother, having taken part in the operation in Hamah, later headed out with a group of mujahidin to join the effort to capture the city of Safirah in the Aleppo countryside from the Nusayri regime shortly before the start of the Sahwah in the Levant. He took part in a battle in the village of Tall Hasil located near Safirah and was quick to volunteer when the commander asked for a group of brothers to infiltrate \n\f", "schema:headline": "Interview", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "64"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq9-HIKMAH", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "9", "schema:articleBody": "\u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn Hubsh\u012b (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anh) said that the Prophet (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) was asked, \u201cWhat deeds are the best?\u201d He replied, \u201c\u012am\u0101n without doubt, jih\u0101d  without  ghul\u016bl  (ghan\u012bmah  theft), and  a  mabr\u016br  (sinless)  Hajj.\u201d  He  was asked, \u201cWhat prayer is best?\u201d He replied, \u201cThat with long qun\u016bt (Qur\u2019\u0101n recital).\u201d He was asked, \u201cWhat charity is best?\u201d He replied, \u201cWhat is given with effort by a person with little wealth.\u201d He was asked, \u201cWhat  hijrah  is  best?\u201d  He  replied, \u201cHe who  abandons  what  Allah  prohibited him from.\u201d He was asked, \u201cWhat jih\u0101d is best?\u201d He replied, \u201cHe who performs jih\u0101d against the mushrik\u012bn with both his wealth  and  life.\u201d  He  was  asked, \u201cWhat killing is noblest?\u201d He replied, \u201cHe whose blood is spilled and horse is slaughtered.\u201d [Hasan: Reported by Im\u0101m Ahmad, Ab\u016b D\u0101w\u016bd, and an-Nas\u0101\u2019\u012b]\ndabiq\n\fhe  ultimately  memorized  it  by  heart completely.

And out of Allah\u2019s great mercy towards the Muslims, He has afflicted them with one \n45\fexpenses in an equally cunning manner. Thus, with the mercy of Allah, Ab\u016b Jandal was able to proceed on his hijrah to Sh\u0101m. He walked towards Allah, and Allah came running to him, as He had promised the believers.\nWhen the news leaked that Ab\u016b Jandal had left the country for the Middle East and had not attended the conference, his murtadd maternal uncle, who is connected  with  Bengali  military  intelligence  agency DGFI  (Directorate  General  of  Forces  Intelligence), tried his best to prevent him from entering Sh\u0101m. Despite the efforts of his uncle and the DGFI, however, Ab\u016b  Jandal,  by  Allah\u2019s  grace,  succeeded  in  entering Sh\u0101m with great ease, underscoring what the Prophet g had said to the young companion \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s  j, \u201cKnow that if the whole world were to gather  together  in  order  to  benefit  you  something, they would not be able to benefit you with anything other than that which Allah had written for you. And if they were to gather together in order to harm you with something, they would not be able to harm you except with that which Allah had written against you\u201d [Reported  by  at-Tirmidh\u012b].\nUpon entering the blessed land of Sh\u0101m, his heart was full of joy, and he became the youngest brother among the Bengali muh\u0101jir\u012bn. As soon as he joined the  training  camp,  he  informed  the  trainer  that  he wanted to carry out an istishh\u0101d\u012b operation and added his name to the list. He was always cheerful and smiling. While awaiting his turn to carry out an istishh\u0101d\u012b operation, he joined a battalion and was stationed in rib\u0101t in \u2018Ayn al-Isl\u0101m. Despite his rib\u0101t and fighting, his heart was always concerned for the brothers in his former homeland and the progress of jih\u0101d there. He dreamed of Bengal becoming a frontline for the Islamic State and a graveyard for the murtadd\u012bn. When he would come back to the city from rib\u0101t, he would rush to the brothers and inquire about the progress in Bengal. \nHe also used to give sincere nas\u012bhah to the brothers here, and despite growing up in a wealthy family, he always tried to distance himself from city life, preferring instead the toils of jih\u0101d. Before leaving to partake in one of the battles in \u2018Ayn \u2018\u012as\u0101, he informed a brother that he did not want to stay in the city and was trying to move to the mountains of Wil\u0101yat Dimashq. At the time, Ramad\u0101n was approaching, and his heart was attached to shah\u0101dah. He told the brothers with him of his desire for shah\u0101dah and prayed that Allah would accept him in the month of Ramad\u0101n. He then left for the battle in \u2018Ayn \u2018\u012as\u0101 as an inghim\u0101s\u012b. During the course of the operation, he was shot by a 23mm autocannon. The medical team evacuated him from the battlefield and attempted to give him first aid, but he died due to excessive bleeding. The doctor on duty \ninformed the brothers with him that before his last breath he pronounced the shah\u0101dah. \nPrior to heading out for the inghim\u0101s\u012b operation, Ab\u016b Jandal wrote the following letter to his brothers in Islam:\n\u201cIn  the  name  of  Allah,  the  Most  Gracious,  the Most Merciful. All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the Universe, the only one worthy of worship, the only one whose laws will prevail all over the world, the only one in whom the believers should put their trust and hope. To proceed.\u201d\n\u201cThis  is  a  sincere  message  from  your  beloved brother living in the blessed lands of the Islamic State. Verily it is Allah\u2019s laws and the sacrifice of the brothers that makes a land blessed. Y\u0101 ikhw\u0101n\u012b fill\u0101h, four or five months ago I was in the same position as you. I didn\u2019t have any plan as to how to avoid the fitnah surrounding me. I didn\u2019t know how I would ever be able to do jih\u0101d f\u012b sab\u012blill\u0101h. I thought that all my family and friends would boycott me. I was drowning in the same obstacles that you might be going through now. But it is only the promise of Allah, the promise of that Garden in which rivers flow, that kept me going. And it was enough, insh\u0101\u2019all\u0101h.\u201d\n\u201cThe following are some points of nas\u012bhah, which I am trying hard to follow and would hope that you, my beloved brothers, would also try to follow. Please note that it is just my duty to give sincere advice to you. Otherwise, I am too small and too sinful to give you advice.\u201d\u2022  \u201cQiy\u0101m al-layl. Y\u0101 akh\u012b, it had been the solution for the Sah\u0101bah, has been the solution for the brothers, and it will be the same for you, insh\u0101\u2019all\u0101h. Try getting up 15 minutes before Fajr and praying two raka\u2019ah of qiy\u0101m al-layl. When you get used to it, then increase by 15 minutes. Is this so hard?\u201d\n\u2022  \u201cTry to make the Qur\u2019\u0101n your best companion. Read it, listen to it, memorize it, spend much time with it, apply it. It is better than gossiping with the  brothers.\u201d\n\u2022  \u201cTry to do regular physical exercise at home. Don\u2019t \nskip this point.\u201d\nIndeed,  Ab\u016b  Jandal  was  among  those  brothers who were not satisfied with merely reaching the lands of the Khil\u0101fah and partaking in jih\u0101d for the cause of Allah. One can see from his letter that despite being involved in jih\u0101d, one of the greatest acts of sacrifice and worship, he continually sought to improve himself and strengthen his relationship with his Lord. May Allah accept him among the shuhad\u0101\u2019 and inspire many more through his words and deeds.\n51\f", "schema:headline": "From the Pages of History", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "44"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq7-FROM-THE-PAGES-OF-HISTORY", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "whom  Allah  does  not  guide  is  deviant,  anyone whom He does not decree wellbeing for is afflicted, and anyone whom Allah does not aid is abandoned.

The passage was closed on 15 Ramad\u0101n 1433, and it was at that time that hunger started assaulting the Muslims\u2019 bodies and death started reaping their souls until more than 170 people died due to lack of supplies and hunger.\nD\u0101biq: What is the relationship between Akn\u0101f Bayt  al-Maqdis  and  Hamas?  Did  Hamas  take part  militarily,  operationally,  politically,  or through  propaganda,  in  the  war  against  the Islamic State?\nYarm\u016bk: Akn\u0101f Bayt al-Maqdis is Hamas\u2019 branch in  South  Dimashq.  This  faction  was  established during the beginning of the events in Sh\u0101m for a fundamental aim, which was the creation of an internal  force  considered  \u201crevolutionaries\u201d  who at the same time act as guards defending regimecontrolled  Dimashq;  and  Akn\u0101f  succeeded  in this  task.  As  for  what  concerns  the  relationship between Hamas and Akn\u0101f, the names of the three \ndabiq\n\fclaimed  just  last  year  was  being  successfully pushed  back  by  American  intervention  policy. Indeed, he claimed that the same model (cutting finances, recruitment tools, and the will to fight) that worked so \u201cwell\u201d in the degradation of the muj\u0101hid\u012bn there before their pledge of allegiance, would work just as well on the Islamic State.\nSome things just don\u2019t work out as planned.\nThe energy behind this movement is fearsome. A single lion can kill an antelope but a pride that is hungry and cunning enough can, if they work closely together, take down an African elephant. As groups of muj\u0101hid\u012bn from around the world join  forces,  so  the  strength  behind  the  Islamic State  puts  them  in  a  position  to  devour  much larger prey.\nThe  West  and  its  allies  have,  once  again,  been caught  completely  by  surprise  as  they  now  find themselves  fighting  not  just  one  enemy  in  Iraq and  Sh\u0101m,  but  now  an  international  army  of muj\u0101hid\u012bn  numbering  hundreds  of  thousands in  different  countries,  whole  continents  apart. It\u2019s taken the coalition the best part of a year to put together a campaign against the Islamic State that is only now seeing a Shia mob supported by coalition aircraft make moves against Tikrit, but that\u2019s old news before it\u2019s even begun. Why focus on Tikrit when the Middle East, Africa, and Asia are now on fire?\nAnd  this  movement  shows  no  sign  of  abating. Indeed, this quickening, this coming together of Islamic groups sharing the same focus and purity of belief is only intensifying. And the more groups that join, the stronger the movement becomes.\nAs  the  groups  evolve  from  splintered  cells  each waging their own wars to a single, unified body, it becomes a force of immense power, like a snowball that  rolls  down  a  mountain  getting  larger  until you end up with an avalanche. The more outfits work together, so they can use each other\u2019s skills and strengths to fill in the gaps until there are very few weak points.\nRAND crusader Jonah Blank\n\u201cSay one group is very good at bomb making and the other group is very good at propaganda,\u201d says Jonah  Blank  from  the  US  \u201cthink-tank\u201d  RAND Corporation.  \u201cIf  you  put  the  right  bomb  in  the right  place  for  the  right  propaganda  effect,  that can  be  far  more  important  than  either  of  these things on their own.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just propaganda,\u201d said Gary Bernsten, a former CIA intelligence officer on an interview with Fox News on 9th March. \u201cISIS has billions of dollars. They have a network of communications for reaching out to these groups. And it shows you how deadly and effective ISIS is. They are truly the most  successful  Sunni  terrorist  group  in  history because  they\u2019ve  carved  out  a  space  for  a  nation state,  and  these  other  groups  recognize  that.  It shows Obama\u2019s statement that \u2018this isn\u2019t Islam\u2019 is a false narrative. ISIS has been brilliant at selling itself  to  the  hundreds  of  millions  of  people  out there looking for a message.\u201d\nAnd what of Obama of late? In all honesty, I haven\u2019t seen what the Nobel Peace prizewinner has been commenting  on  recently,  but  he  can\u2019t  be  having much fun. \u201cThis strategy of taking out terrorists \ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "INTERVIEW WITH THE AM\u012aR OF THE YARM\u016aK CAMP REGION", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "66"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq11-AMONG-THE-BELIEVERS-ARE-MEN", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "dabiq\n\fIndeed, when Allah obligated jih\u0101d for His cause upon his male slaves and placed a tremendous reward in it not found in other duties, some women became jealous and envious.

So he said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, what wealth should we seek to possess?\u2019 He said, \u2018Let one of you possess a thankful heart, a tongue that remembers Allah,  and  a  wife  that  helps  him  in  the  matter  of  the Hereafter\u2019\u201d [Hasan: Reported by Im\u0101m Ahmad and Ibn M\u0101jah].\nMay  my  father,  mother,  and  myself  be  sacrificed  in defense  of  Allah\u2019s  Messenger,  who  was  bestowed  with comprehensive  speech:  \u201cA  wife  that  helps  him  in  the matter  of  the  Hereafter,\u201d  the  Hereafter,  the  important matter,  the  ultimate  goal,  and  the  concern  of  the intelligent,  discerning  believer.  How  eloquent  is  the statement of the woman who said to her spouse when she saw him worried one day, \u201cWhy are you sad? Is it because of the Duny\u0101, then Allah has finished decreeing it. Or is it because of the Hereafter? In which case may Allah increase you in worry!\u201d\nAnd you, O sister in Islam, O wife of a muj\u0101hid, your \nhusband  is  one  whom  the  world  today  agreed  upon waging  war  against.  My  sister,  do  you  know  who  the muj\u0101hid is? A man who turned his back on the Duny\u0101 and  went  out  seeking  his  death  so  that  the  Ummah may live. And I think that on the day he came forward to marry you, if he was not a muj\u0101hid then, he was a muj\u0101hid in the making. At the very least, you were aware of his methodology and creed, and you knew what type of life he sought to live. And if he was a deviant sitting back from jih\u0101d at the time, he has repented to Allah, and Allah is more joyed by the repentance of His slave than  a  man  who  wakes  up  and  finds  his  camel  next to him after losing it in the desert! So why do we find some of the muj\u0101hid\u012bn\u2019s wives complaining about their lives? If she hears of an imminent battle that he will be in, she gets angry. If she sees him putting on war armor, she gets upset. If he goes out for rib\u0101t, she gets in a bad mood.  If  he  returns  late,  she  complains.  O  my  sister, who deluded you and told you that the life of jih\u0101d is one of comfort and ease? Do you not love jih\u0101d and its people? Please listen. Indeed you are in jih\u0101d when you await the return of your husband patiently, anticipating Allah\u2019s reward, and making du\u2019\u0101\u2019 for him and those with him to attain victory and consolidation. You are in jih\u0101d when you uphold your loyalty to him in his absence. You are in jih\u0101d when you teach his children the difference between  the  truth  and  falsehood,  between  right  and wrong. Indeed, you, my precious sister, are today the wife of a muj\u0101hid, and tomorrow you might be the wife of a shah\u012bd, or an injured fighter, or a prisoner \u2013 so how ready is your supply of patience and steadfastness? If you are discontent and complain in times of ease and comfort, how will you be in times of hardship and affliction?! Will you be patient if he returns to you being carried with his blood pouring, or do you want your husband only when he is well?\nIbn Kath\u012br \uf072 said, \u201cThe scholars of tafs\u012br and history, as well as others, said that Ayy\u016bb \uf06e was a wealthy man who possessed many different types of wealth, including livestock,  slaves,  cattle,  and  ample  land  in  the  region of al-Buthaynah in the land of H\u016br\u0101n. And Ibn \u2018As\u0101kir narrated that all of it belonged to him and that he had sons and many relatives. Then he was bereaved of these things altogether and his body was afflicted with various illnesses and no healthy organ remained in him except for his heart and his tongue, with which he remembered Allah  b,  and  throughout  all  that  he  was  patient, anticipating reward from Allah and remembering Allah b day and night. His illness was so long, that even his friends and companions deserted him. He was expelled from his land and cast onto a garbage heap outside of it.

However, this in itself is not enough to save me. Although I\u2019ve been informed that the aerial campaign in Iraq has been halted, which at the moment has given me breathing room thanks be to God, I believe it looks like it\u2019s not enough Mom because Obama\u2019s recent decision to fly spy drones over Syria in the Islamic State\u2019s airspace is only aggravating and infuriating my captors further. This is obviously because the US government is interfering yet again in the affairs of the Islamic State. As for me being a journalist, they know this. I\u2019ve repeatedly told them this, but like they always say, do US airstrikes differentiate between those who are armed and those who are unarmed? Likewise they don\u2019t. Beseeching the Caliphate to spare my life will not help either of us, as the matter is in Obama\u2019s  next  judgment.  As  you  and  the  world have plainly seen in the recent video, the message was my life depends on Obama\u2019s next decision.\nMom, please don\u2019t let Obama kill me. Do not let him  get  away  with  murder  again.  What  doesn\u2019t our government understand? Don\u2019t get involved in the Islamic State\u2019s internal and external affairs. Leave them to fight their own war.\nMom, you can still save my life, just like the families of my previous cellmates who I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve met.  Pressure  our  government  to  not  involve themselves in the affairs of these people.\nAt the rate that Obama\u2019s administration is going, this could very well be the last you hear from me. Please don\u2019t let that be the case. Fight for me.I love you.\n[End of Message]\n\fbeen  executed  by  the  Islamic  State  in  the  most visceral way possible after the British and American  governments  apparently  made  a  joint  decision not to discuss terms for our release with our captors. And now, unless something changes very quickly and very radically, I await my turn.\nSuch an environment forces the mind to change. I\u2019ve  had  to  become  pretty  tough  inside,  sometimes  just  to  get  through  each  day.  The  Sheikh who originally captured James Foley and me back in November 2012 said, \u201cto go through this you will need a heart of stone.\u201d And he was right. I try to  stay  very  calm,  tolerant  and  accepting  of  my situation. Muslims call it \u2018Qadr Allah,\u2019 the will of God, who determines everything in advance. I am thankful for any comfort I receive and for every plate of food I get.\nIt hasn\u2019t been an easy road, and some of us had a bumpy ride. Once we were finally put into general population with dozens of European prisoners, we had to watch them all go home to their loved ones while we, the British and Americans, were left behind. That was a bitter pill to swallow, but  nothing  compared to what came next. Now I\u2019ve had to watch as James, Steven Sotloff, David Haines and Alan Henning walked out of the door, one every two weeks since August 18th, never to return, knowing they were going to be killed and going to their deaths. \nAnd  now  they\u2019re  gone,  their  faces  and  deaths plastered all over the world\u2019s headlines, four foolish policy victims.\nWhat does that do to a man? After enduring years of pain, darkness and regret, to see it all end in such a  ghastly  way  when  everyone  else  went  home, to  see  ordinary  guys,  family  men,  loving  fathers killed  because  their  governments  wouldn\u2019t  negotiate because of \u2018policy,\u2019 wouldn\u2019t even discuss options for saving them with their families \u2013 can you begin to imagine how that feels? This wasn\u2019t a fateful soul taken at random, it was individuals missing for years in one of the most high-profile hostage crisis seen in modern history, with dozens \nof  witnesses  who  had  gone  home  testifying they were alive and could be helped. I believe even the mujahidin were genuinely surprised at how easily our countries left us for dead. \nWe\u2019d  come  all  this  way,  putting  one  foot  in front  of  the  other,  supporting  one  another when  it  got  tough,  praying  together  every day. We used to call it the Dead Zone when things got bad, after the area Everest climbers face above 26,000 feet as they approach the summit, when every step is agony, when they hardly have enough strength to carry on. We never  gave  up  hope  that  our  nations  would negotiate for our release.\nBut all that time, we never knew that the decision regarding our fate had been made months beforehand in Washington and Whitehall. We never knew that our families, for whom it was like being locked up in prison with us, were being blanked by the governments or being told there  was  nothing  they  could  do.  We  never knew that the families were left to themselves to try anything and everything, while the men in charge folded their arms and offered their sympathies.\ndabiq\f", "schema:headline": "A MESSAGE FROM SOTLOFF ", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "47"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq10-INTERVIEW-WITH-AB\u016a-SAM\u012aR-AL-URDUN\u012a", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "Interview with Ab\u016b Sam\u012br al-Urdun\u012b\nD\u0101biq: What information do you have about the Sahwah plot and the role of the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front in it?\nAb\u016b Sam\u012br: Jawl\u0101n\u012b visited me in the last days of December  2013  and  informed  me  that  he  had been  in  a  meeting  with  the  \u201cIslamic  Front\u201d  and its  battalions  including  \u201cLiw\u0101\u2019  at-Tawh\u012bd\u201d  and also  some  of  the  battalions  that  belong  to  the Free Syrian Army. He informed me that they had decided  to  fight  the  Islamic  State.  I  said  to  him, \u201cWhy were you invited to this meeting?\u201d He said, \u201cFor the issue to be proposed and discussed with me, because I am one of the sides in the arena and close to the Islamic State.\u201d I said to him, \u201cWhat was your response?\u201d He said, \u201cI told them I would cover the fronts against the regime.\u201d I said, \u201cThen that is your role!\u201d He said to me, \u201cHow can you say I have a role to play?\u201d So I said to him, \u201cYou are going to cover  some  of  the  battlefronts  that  these  factions now hold in order for them to withdraw and then gather in larger numbers against the Islamic State.\u201d This  is  really  what  happened  afterwards  and  that was approximately 10 days after this meeting with Jawl\u0101n\u012b on 3 January 2014.1\nIn  fact,  I  even  heard  Ahmad  Zakk\u016br,  one  of  the leaders  of  \u201cJabhat  an-Nusrah,\u201d  calling  Jawl\u0101n\u012b  on the  walkie-talkie  when  he  had  disappeared  from sight  after  the  fighting  between  the  Islamic  State and  the  factions  including  the  Free  Syrian  Army had begun. Zakk\u016br said to him, \u201cWe have to help our brothers from the factions present in the arena and  stop  the  oppression  of  the  Islamic  State  and fight against it.\u201d\nThis is in addition to other events I myself witnessed. When  for  example,  some  of  the  leadership  of \u201cJabhat  an-Nusrah\u201d  supported  the  Free  Syrian Army with weapons and helped them in fighting against  the  Islamic  State  in  some  regions,  as  was the case of Hammawdah and Ab\u016b Dharr at-T\u016bnus\u012b in the western part of Halab. [Hammawdah is the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front\u2019s top leader of that region].\n1 Editor\u2019s Note: Jawl\u0101n\u012b had foreknowledge of the plot and kept it hidden from the Islamic State. Rather he took part in the planning and execution of the plot, a plot which almost destroyed the mission of jih\u0101d in Sh\u0101m and by which the pure blood of the muh\u0101jir\u012bn and ans\u0101r was poured. Then some dare to claim that his front did not partake in the Sahwah!\nThe  same  thing  in  Idlib,  in  that  Ab\u016b  Sulaym\u0101n the  Australian  prevented  the  soldiers  of  \u201cJabhat an-Nusrah\u201d  from  helping  the  Islamic  State  when the Free Syrian Army planned to attack the State\u2019s training  camp  there  while  it  was  possible  for them to help the Islamic State. So I sent for Ab\u016b Sulaym\u0101n the Australian and said to him, \u201cYou are able to place detachments to prevent the Free Syrian Army\u2019s advance towards the training camp.\u201d I was surprised the next day that the Free Syrian Army had entered the training camp after surrounding it and cutting off reinforcement lines, and had fought the  soldiers  of  the  Islamic  State  inside.  This  was the  beginning  of  my  suspicion  that  there  was  an internal  plot  between  the  Free  Syrian  Army  and \u201cJabhat an-Nusrah.\u201d\nD\u0101biq: When did you decide to distance yourself from the events that were occurring?\nAb\u016b Sam\u012br: After my examination and following of the events, I felt that there was a plot being carried out against the Islamic State with the participation of \u201cJabhat an-Nusrah.\u201d So I decided to keep myself distant  and  move  to  the  south.  On  my  way,  I gathered much evidence for this conclusion. From it is that I met Ab\u016b \u2018Abb\u0101s ad-Dar\u012br, who was the leader of \u201cJabhat an-Nusrah\u201d for the region of arRaqqah. I met him in the area of Alb\u016bkam\u0101l and asked  him  about  the  reason  for  his  fighting  the Islamic State in ar-Raqqah. He mentioned to me the whole story of how he and Ahr\u0101r ash-Sh\u0101m had agreed with many of the battalions including those of Ab\u016b \u2018\u012as\u0101 ar-Raqqah (Liw\u0101\u2019 Thuww\u0101r ar-Raqqah) \nAb\u016b Sulaym\u0101n the Australian,an ally of the FSA\ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "INTERVIEW WITH AB\u016a SAM\u012aR AL-URDUN\u012a", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "70"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq10-AMERICAN-KURDISTAN", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "FSA  secularists  join  hands  with  the  atheist PKK to fight the Islamic State\nThe  next  few  months  would  see  the  crusaders focusing  three  quarters  of  the  airstrikes  in  Iraq and  Sh\u0101m  on  the  city  of  \u2018Ayn  al-Isl\u0101m  alone in  an  attempt  to  dislodge  the  muj\u0101hid\u012bn  \u2013  all this  in  support  of  the  \u201cfearsome\u201d  PKK  fighters.

That one nation is the group following the Quran and the Sunnah, with allegiance to one leader, the Caliph of the Muslims. Referring to when there shall appear \u201ccallers to the gates of Hell,\u201d who are \u201cof our skin and our language\u201d and whose followers will be thrown into the Fire, our Prophet g commanded that we \u201cadhere to the group of the Muslims and their leader\u201d (Al-Bukhari and Muslim); yes, the single group of the Muslims and their single leader, around whom they unite and fulfill Allah\u2019s command, \u201cO you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those of authority amongst you\u201d (An-Nisa 59).\nDo you not see the many so-called \u201cimams\u201d and \u201cscholars\u201d calling to alliances against Islam with the disbelievers, to maintaining the Muslim nation\u2019s separation by imaginary borders, and to rejecting the reestablishment  of  the  Caliphate,  which  many  of  the earlier scholars called \u201cthe most important of obligations?!\u201d Are these imams not \u201cof our skin and our language,\u201d yet call to what would inevitably lead to our doom? Indeed, they are callers to the gates of Hell, so beware and do not be fooled by them.\nSo reject these calls to disunity and come together. Live the life of Islam, for which you have already left the path of falsehood, and do not die the death of  Jahiliyyah,  a  time  in  which  there  was  no  united Muslim nation having pledged allegiance to a single imam and thus having no obedience to a rightful authority. Indeed, the Prophet g said, \u201cWhoever dies unbound by a bay\u2019ah (pledge of allegiance) has died a jahili death\u201d (Muslim). And he said, \u201cWhoever dislikes something in his leader, let him be patient. For whoever leaves the obedience of lawful authority, even \nBeware of dying as an apostate\na hand span (and dies), has died the death of Jahiliyyah\u201d (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nAt the onset of Ramadan in 1435, the mujahidin, who were engaging fierce battles against the Crusaders, their allies, and their puppets in Iraq and the Levant, reached a level where all conditions required to announce the Caliphate were met. So with great joy, the lost obligation was revived and the Muslim world could once again be united, by Allah\u2019s grace, around a single imam, Ibrahim Ibn \u2018Awwad al-Badri \uf085.\nRegardless of where you are, know that pledging allegiance is an obligation upon you, as is listening to your leader, the Caliph, and obeying his command. Allah\u2019s Messenger g said, \u201cThe Muslim must listen and obey in what he loves and what he hates, as long as he is not commanded with a sin. If he is commanded with a sin, there is neither listening nor obeying (in that sin)\u201d (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nRush to perform hijrah (emigration) to the land of Islam, where the Shari\u2019ah is in full application. Hijrah is a sign of both one\u2019s love for unity and his adherence to the Sunnah of Allah\u2019s Messenger g. This was reiterated as a direct order from Amirul-Muminin, who said, \u201cO Muslims everywhere, whoever is capable of performing hijrah to the Islamic State, then let him do so, because hijrah to the land of Islam is obligatory\u201d (A Message to the Mujahidin and the Muslim Ummah).\nBut  if  you  are  unable  to  do  so,  then  know  that \n\fChristian disbelief and paganism\nthat the masses deem to be \u201cpolitically incorrect.\u201d The apostate \u201cimams\u201d in the West will adhere to the same tired clich\u00e9 in order to avoid a backlash from the disbelieving societies in which they\u2019ve chosen to reside. The point is, people know that it\u2019s foolish, but they keep repeating it regardless because they\u2019re afraid of the consequences of deviating from the script.\nThere  are  exceptions  among  the  disbelievers,  no doubt, people who will unabashedly declare that jihad and the laws of the Shari\u2019ah \u2013 as well as everything else deemed taboo by the Islam-is-a-peaceful-religion crowd \u2013 are in fact completely Islamic, but they tend to be people with far less credibility who are painted as a social fringe, so their voices are dismissed and a large segment of the ignorant masses continues believing the false narrative. As such, it becomes important for us to clarify to the West in unequivocal terms \u2013 yet again \u2013 why we hate you and why we fight you.\n1.  We hate you, first and foremost, because you are  disbelievers;  you  reject  the  oneness  of  Allah  \u2013 whether  you  realize  it  or  not  \u2013  by  making  partners for  Him  in  worship,  you  blaspheme  against  Him, claiming that He has a son, you fabricate lies against His prophets and messengers, and you indulge in all manner of devilish practices. It is for this reason that we were commanded to openly declare our hatred for you and our enmity towards you. \u201cThere has already been for you an excellent example in Abraham and \nthose with him, when they said to their people, \u2018Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than Allah. We have rejected you, and there has arisen, between us and you, enmity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone\u2019\u201d (Al-Mumtahanah 4). Furthermore, just as your disbelief  is  the  primary  reason  we  hate  you,  your  disbelief is the primary reason we fight you, as we have been commanded to fight the disbelievers until they submit to the authority of Islam, either by becoming Muslims, or by paying jizyah \u2013 for those afforded this option \u2013 and living in humiliation under the rule of the Muslims. Thus, even if you were to stop fighting us, your best-case scenario in a state of war would be that we would suspend our attacks against you \u2013 if we deemed it necessary \u2013 in order to focus on the closer and more immediate threats, before eventually resuming our campaigns against you. Apart from the option of a temporary truce, this is the only likely scenario that would bring you fleeting respite from our attacks. So in the end, you cannot bring an indefinite halt to our war against you. At most, you could only delay it temporarily. \u201cAnd fight them until there is no fitnah [paganism] and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah\u201d (Al-Baqarah 193).\n2.

We fight here, while our goal is Rome with good expectations concerning Allah that He makes us the keys for the Prophetic good tidings and Godly decrees\u201d [Riy\u0101h an-Nasr].\nThis attitude then was inherited by his successor, Ab\u016b Hamzah al-Muh\u0101jir (rahimahull\u0101h), who said, \u201cO muwahhid\u012bn, receive glad tidings, for by Allah, we will not rest from our jih\u0101d  until we are under the olive trees of Rome, after we destroy the filthy house called the White House\u201d [Inil Hukmu Ill\u0101 Lill\u0101h].\nThis attitude was also echoed by the mountainous man, Ab\u016b \u2018Umar al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (rahimahull\u0101h), who said, \u201cO soldiers of the Islamic State, O youth of Muhammad (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam)\u2026 Today we are upon the doorstep for a new era, a turning point for the map of the region, rather the world. Today we witness the end of the lie called western  civilization  and  the  rise  of  the  Islamic  giant. This is exactly what Bush warned against in his last speech  in  front  of  veterans  when  he  said, \u2018The region is changing into one that threatens  civilization  with  destruction,\u2019  meaning the civilization of shirk and kufr, the civilization of usury and prostitution, the civili-\nzation of humiliation and subjugation. And he said regarding the soldiers of the Islamic State in Mesopotamia, \u2018They strive to reestablish a khil\u0101fah expanding from Spain to Indonesia.\u2019 This was after he made them the single Sunn\u012b threat towards America and its civilization\u201d [Wa Yamkur\u016bna Wa Yamkurull\u0101h].\nAnd he said, \u201cThis prompted the enemy of Allah \u2013 Bush \u2013 to say after the blessed rise of the Islamic State, \u2018They strive to establish an Islamic State stretching from China to Spain.\u2019 He spoke the truth although he is a liar\u201d [Wa Qul J\u0101\u2019al Haqqu Wa Zahaqal B\u0101til].\nAnd this certainty in Allah\u2019s promise prompted Ab\u016b \u2018Umar al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b to say with full conviction,  \u201cInna  Dawlatal-Isl\u0101mi  B\u0101qiyah\u201d  (Indeed, the Islamic State will remain\u2026) [Has\u0101d as-Sin\u012bn].\n\fed by their fear of you? Why is it that the chest muscles of America and its allies shiver out of fear of you? Where are your warplanes? Where are your battleships? Where are your missiles? Where are your weapons of mass destruction? Why is it that the world has united against you? Why  have  the  nations  of  disbelief  entrenched together against you?\u201d\n\u201cSo know that \u2013 by Allah \u2013 we fear not the swarms of planes, nor ballistic missiles, nor drones, nor satellites, nor battleships, nor weapons of mass destruction.

And upon Allah let the believers rely} [\u0100li \u2018Imr\u0101n: 160]. How could we fear them, while Allah the Exalted has said, {So do not weaken and do not grieve, and you will be superior if you are [true] believers} [\u0100li \u2018Imr\u0101n: 139].\u201d\nother, for some people have entered your ranks who are not of you and are only claimants. And thus some disorder has occurred. So it has become  necessary  for  a  trial  to  come,  expel  the filth, and purify the ranks. We ask Allah for forgiveness and wellness.  Also, pride and  conceit has entered some of our souls, and thus some of us transgressed and oppressed others. So it is necessary for the sins to be expelled, so that you may return to your Lord. Allah has loved the muj\u0101hid\u012bn, and so there is no choice but for Him to take some martyrs. We ask Allah to make us of them, not from the disgraced nor those afflicted [in their religion].\u201d\n\u201cO America, O allies of America, and O crusaders,  know  that  the  matter  is  more  dangerous than  you  have  imagined  and  greater  than  you have envisioned. We have warned you that today we are in a new era, an era where the State, its soldiers, and its sons are leaders not slaves. They are a people who through the ages have not known defeat. The outcome of their battles is concluded before they begin. They have not prepared for a battle since the time of Noah except with absolute conviction of victory. Being killed \u2013 according to their account \u2013 is a victory. This is where the secret lies. You fight a people who can never be defeated.\u201d\n\u201cTherefore Allah will give you victory. Indeed, Allah will give you victory. By Allah, Allah will give you victory.  So  guarantee  for  us  two  matters,  and we will guarantee you \u2013 by Allah\u2019s permission \u2013  constant  victory  and  consolidation.  First,  do not  oppress  anyone  nor  be  content  with  oppression by being silent about it and not raising the matter to those in authority. Second, do not become conceited or arrogant. This is what we fear from you and fear for you.\u201d\n\u201cThereafter know that a trial, sifting, and selection, are necessary between one period and an-\n\u201cAnd so we promise you by Allah\u2019s permission that this campaign will be your final campaign. It  will  be  broken  and  defeated,  just  as  all your  previous  campaigns  were  broken  and defeated, except that this time we will raid you  thereafter,  and  you  will  never  raid  us. \ndabiq\f", "schema:headline": "FOREWORD ", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq7-FOREWORD", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "FOREWORD\nIt was nothing save the plan of Allah from which the pagans felt secure. And so immediately the Islamic  State  demanded  200  million  dollars from the Japanese government, the same sum initially committed to the crusaders and their apostate allies by the Japanese Prime Minister. The  Khil\u0101fah  was  not  in  need  of  the  money and knew fully that the Japanese would never provide the sum, but it had decided \u2013 by this demand  \u2013  to  humiliate  the  arrogance  of  this Japanese government\u2026 a government in a line of  governments  enslaved  by  the  West  since the Second World War.\nAfter  the  passing  of  the  first  deadline,  the Japanese prisoner Haruna Yukawa was executed while Japanese representatives rushed to the murtadd  Jordanian  regime.  The  Islamic  State immediately  requested  for  the  release  and transfer  of  S\u0101jidah  ar-R\u012bsh\u0101w\u012b  \u2013  a  muj\u0101hidah who was imprisoned by the Jordanian t\u0101gh\u016bt for  almost  10  years  \u2013  to  the  lands  of  the Khil\u0101fah in exchange for Kenji Goto Jogo. The Jordanian  regime  recklessly  complicated  the process  for  the  Japanese  by  attempting  to include  their  pilot  in  the  exchange  deal,  but the  Khil\u0101fah  explicitly  refused  such  during the  negotiations  with  the  representative  of the Jordanian t\u0101gh\u016bt \u2013 \u2018\u0100sim T\u0101hir al-Barq\u0101w\u012b (AKA Ab\u016b Muhammad al-Maqdis\u012b1) \u2013 as there were other plans for the murtadd pilot. In the end, both al-Barq\u0101w\u012b\u2019s murtadd client and the Japanese  prisoner  were  executed  due  to  the negligence  of  both  regimes  in  heeding  the warnings of the Islamic State. The relatives of Kenji Goto Jogo and the murtadd pilot have no one to blame but the political leaders of their lands  who  strive  to  appease  and  serve  the American crusaders.\nTHE JAPANESE CRUSADER KENJI GOTO JOGO\nJapan is now in a complicated predicament. How can it escape this threat? Can Abe Shinzo take the step to save his people whom he recklessly exposed to the wrath of the Khil\u0101fah?

Amongst them was the Jordanian Ab\u016b Sayy\u0101f Muhammad ashShalab\u012b, who stated, \u201cThe manner in which he was  executed  and  the  subsequent  production of a video displaying his execution is a matter that opposes the teachings of the pure religion. Jih\u0101d was legislated to make the people enter the religion, not to make them turn away from the religion or to distort its image.\u201d1\nThis  type  of  rhetoric  is  typical  of  hizbiyy\u012bn  \u2013 even  those  masquerading  as  supporters  of the  muj\u0101hid\u012bn  \u2013  who  continue  to  live  under the  authority  of  the  murtadd  puppets,  and of  defeatist  Muslims  who  reside  in  the  lands of  kufr  under  the  authority  of  the  crusaders themselves, with no intention of making hijrah to those lands in which the word of Allah is the highest.  Such  people  have  had  their  religion diluted and, not surprisingly, are always amongst the  first  to  speak  out  in  any  case  where  the \n6 ARTICLE\nTHE LIAR AB\u016a SAYY\u0100F\nmuj\u0101hid\u012bn display their harshness towards the crusaders, attempting to disguise their criticism towards the muj\u0101hid\u012bn as concern for the image of Islam.\nIn burning the crusader pilot alive and burying him  under  a  pile  of  debris,  the  Islamic  State carried  out  a  just  form  of  retaliation  for  his involvement in the crusader bombing campaign which  continues  to  result  in  the  killing  of countless  Muslims  who,  as  a  result  of  these airstrikes,  are  burned  alive  and  buried  under mountains of debris. This is not to even mention _____________1   Ab\u016b Sayy\u0101f ash-Shalab\u012b exposed the full extent of his evil when displaying his remorse for the murtadd pilot in the face of the muj\u0101hid\u012bn. He also fabricated stories about the negotiations regarding the prisoners by claiming to be involved in these negotiations, whereas the representative of the Jordanian t\u0101gh\u016bt from the beginning was \u2018\u0100sim T\u0101hir al-Barq\u0101w\u012b (AKA Ab\u016b Muhammad al-Maqdis\u012b,  whose  campaign  of  lies  carries  on).

Financial website Quartz wrote, \u201cThe gold dinar taps into a deep history of Islamic coinage that stretches back almost to the time of Muhammad himself. The Islamic dinar appeared in 696 AD, when the Umayyad empire \u2013 based in Damascus \u2013 stretched from the Iberian peninsula to the Indus River in South Asia.\u201d\nAnd the value of gold is soaring.

None  of  this  is  praiseworthy,  and  indeed the  Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  used to  seek  refuge  from  knowledge  that  does  not benefit [Reported by Muslim on the authority of Zayd].

The Prophet (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) disliked excessive and extensive speech, and loved concise speech.

The  Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam) attested  to  the  people  of  Yemen  having  \u012bm\u0101n and fiqh. The people of Yemen are the least in speech from amongst the people and the least excessive in knowledge because their knowledge is beneficial knowledge in their hearts, and they only express with their tongues what they need to of that knowledge. And that is true fiqh and beneficial knowledge\u201d [Fadl \u2018Ilm as-Salaf].\nAfter  reading  \u201cFadl  \u2018Ilm  as-Salaf  \u2018Al\u0101  \u2018Ilm  alKhalaf\u201d  by  al-H\u0101fidh  Ibn  Rajab  (rahimahull\u0101h), \nhis  statement  \u201cThe  people  of  Yemen  are  the least in speech from amongst the people\u201d stuck to my mind for years. I then witnessed it in reality firsthand in the bay\u2019\u0101t announced by the muj\u0101hid\u012bn of the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen, Sinai, Libya, and Algeria, for the shortest of the five statements was the statement of the muj\u0101hid\u012bn of Yemen. It contained wisdom, fiqh and \u012bm\u0101n, and through it, they expressed their full conviction in a brief and concise manner. I ask Allah to make them firm upon their covenant so that they meet Allah while He is pleased with them.\nThe muj\u0101hid\u012bn of Yemen said, \u201cAllah\u2019s Messenger  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  had  given  us glad tidings of Khil\u0101fah upon the methodology of prophethood. And indeed, by Allah, we have seen it as a Khil\u0101fah upon the methodology of prophethood.  And  when  we  heard  the  trumpets  of  the  Jews  and  Christians  \u2013  the  callers upon the gates of Hellfire \u2013 we answered the order of Allah\u2019s Messenger that obliged sticking to the jam\u0101\u2019ah of the Muslims and their Im\u0101m, for Hudhayfah (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anh) said, \u2018The people used to ask Allah\u2019s Messenger (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) about good, and I used to ask him about evil, fearing that it might overtake me\u2026\u2019 In  the  had\u012bth,  he  says,  \u2018Is  there  any  evil  after this good?\u2019 He responded, \u2018Yes, callers upon the gates of Hellfire. Whoever answers them will be thrown into it by them.\u2019 He said, \u2018O Allah\u2019s Messenger, describe them to me.\u2019 He said, \u2018They are from our skin and speak with our tongues.\u2019 He said, \u2018So what do you order me with if I reach that time?\u2019 He said, \u2018Stick to the jam\u0101\u2019ah of the Muslims and their Im\u0101m\u2019 [Al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim].\u201d\nThus,  they  recognized  the  disease  \u2013  splitting and differing \u2013 and they knew the cure \u2013 unity and rallying together. They understood that rallying together meant sticking to the jam\u0101\u2019ah of the Muslims (the Khil\u0101fah) and their Im\u0101m (the Khal\u012bfah), not rallying together upon factionalism and partisanship.

Their apostasy is even grosser than any other, having studied the clear texts proving their collapse into kufr. They have sought to justify the apostasy of their masters with deception, embroidering their arguments with misquoted \u0101y\u0101t, ah\u0101d\u012bth, and \u0101th\u0101r from the Salaf. In the  severest  terms,  they  have  advised the  youth  to  reject  the  true  meaning of jih\u0101d and to replace it with national pride. The \u201chukm of Allah\u201d to them is whatever the Saudi governmental ministries have deemed acceptable. Therefore, it must be understood that these scholars are not simply silent bystanders in the background.\nRather, the palace scholars of the Saudi  regime  \u2013  from  their  \u201cGrand  Muft\u012b\u201d  \u2018Abdul-\u2018Az\u012bz  \u0100l  ash-Shaykh  to  the minions  who  spread  deceitful  prot\u0101gh\u016bt propaganda atop the pulpits of their \u201ckingdom\u201d \u2013 are at the forefront \nof  this  effort  to  dissuade  Muslims from  jih\u0101d  and  from  upholding  the Shar\u012b\u2019ah, averting them from the path of Allah.

It was Ibn \u2018Abdil-Wahh\u0101b r who mentioned  among  the  ten  greatest nullifiers  of  Islam,  \u201cEighth:  Backing the mushrik\u012bn and aiding them against the  Muslims.

He  massacred  thousands  upon  thousands and burned all the books of Ahlus-Sunnah, not even sparing  their  copies  of  the  Qur\u2019\u0101n.  Originally  hosting  an overwhelming  Sunni-majority  population,  Persia,  eastern Iraq, and Khur\u0101s\u0101n were once bustling with knowledge conveyed by the likes of linguists S\u012bbawayh and al-Azhar\u012b; had\u012bth masters al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim; mufassir\u012bn at-Tabar\u012b and alBaghaw\u012b;  and  fuqah\u0101\u2019  al-Marwaz\u012b  and  Ibnul-Mundhir.  But once controlled by the Safawiyyah, these lands became virtually void of scholarship.\nAn  age  of  darkness  quickly  spread  over  the  once  enlightened Persia. Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl and his descendants worked to forcefully convert the Sunni majority to the R\u0101fid\u012b religion. The same took place in other Sunni majority lands, including Azerbaijan. Arab R\u0101fid\u012b \u201cscholars\u201d from Lebanon, Bahrain, and Iraq were imported to teach their deviant tenets. The most famous of them \u2013 and one of the first to arrive \u2013 was \u2018Al\u012b Ibn al-Husayn al-Karak\u012b (died 940AH), who was given the position of \u201cShaykhul-Isl\u0101m\u201d and put in charge of an official agency established to oversee the conversion of Ahlus-Sunnah. It was alKarak\u012b who issued the fat\u0101w\u0101 allowing Ithn\u0101-\u2018Ashr\u012b R\u0101fidah to use military force to establish their rule, thus \u201csubstantiating\u201d Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl\u2019s claims and justifying all of his abuses. Many Sunnis left Persia, but those who stayed were persecuted, having to decide to either apostatize or face death. Regarding this process and his cruelty to Ahlus-Sunnah, Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl said, \u201cThis matter concerns me not, as Allah and the infallible im\u0101ms are with me, so I fear no one. If any of my subjects voice any objection, I shall unsheathe my sword and leave none alive.\u201d\nThe  adh\u0101n  was  altered  to  reflect  R\u0101fid\u012b  \u201cfiqh,\u201d  adding  the phrase \u201cashhadu anna \u2018al\u012byyan wal\u012byull\u0101h\u201d (\u201cI testify that \u2018Al\u012b is the wal\u012b of Allah\u201d). Im\u0101ms were ordered to curse Ab\u016b Bakr as-Sidd\u012bq, \u2018Umar Ibn al-Khatt\u0101b, and \u2018Uthm\u0101n Ibn \u2018Aff\u0101n \uf06a during every Jumu\u2019ah sermon.\n1   These were Turkic militias organized by Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl\u2019s father and known as the Qizilb\u0101sh (Turkish for \u201cRedheads\u201d) because of their crimson crowns of twelve gores each, representing their allegiance to the Twelver sect.\nSunni  graveyards  were  desecrated  and  their  mas\u0101jid  destroyed.

The journey required a great amount of patience and a high degree of security precautions, two things for which Ab\u016b Muh\u0101rib was well known.2\nThrough  their  persistence  and  perseverance,  Allah  granted  them  safe  deliverance  into  Sh\u0101m  in  the  latter  part  of \u201c2012.\u201d Upon arrival, Ab\u016b Muh\u0101rib wasted no time and immediately placed his hand with the Jam\u0101\u2019ah, joining the Islamic State while it was operating under the name \u201cJabhat an-Nusrah,\u201d prior to al-Jawl\u0101n\u012b\u2019s treachery. He was not deceived by the presence of hundreds of groups, or their numerous flags bearing their hypocritical logos and names. It would be through this very manner of foresight and decisiveness that Allah would grant Ab\u016b Muh\u0101rib steadfastness throughout the many trials which the Islamic State would encounter, including al-Jawl\u0101n\u012b\u2019s betrayal and nullification of his bay\u2019ah to Am\u012brul-Mu\u2019min\u012bn Abu Bakr al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (hafidhahull\u0101h).

He participated in the conquest of the Taftan\u0101z airbase near Idlib and the 17th Division base near ar-Raqqah. He also partook in the operation in Salq\u012bn near Idlib \u2013 where Ab\u016b Mu\u2019\u0101wiyah al-Misr\u012b3 was martyred \u2013 as well as in many other battlefronts.

Of the deeds that attest to his kindness and generosity is that after receiving a sabiyyah (concubine) as a gift he did not hesitate to give her away \u2013 likewise as a gift \u2013 to an unmarried injured brother. And from the incidents that attest to his protective jealousy for Islam and its people is that after engaging in a debate with a Madkhal\u012b (a pro-Saudi \u201cSalaf\u012b\u201d) in one of the \u201cmas\u0101jid\u201d in the lands of kufr, the Madkhal\u012b remarked regarding the abuses of the spiteful Jews against our sisters in Palestine that the women \u201cdeserved it.\u201d Ab\u016b Muh\u0101rib had to be restrained from hitting this Madkhal\u012b by other worshippers at the \u201cmasjid.\u201d A brother who witnessed the incident recalled, \u201cAb\u016b Muh\u0101rib began to weep loudly. I watched him in his prayer weeping in suj\u016bd as if he had lost a loved one.\u201d\nAnd amongst the deeds that attest to his affection towards the orphans is that following the martyrdom of Bil\u0101l al-Barj\u0101w\u012b, Ab\u016b Muh\u0101rib would frequently visit his orphaned son, taking him to the mas\u0101jid and entertaining him with trips out to the park and the zoo. He would also teach Qur\u2019\u0101n to other sons of shuhad\u0101\u2019. {Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those with him are forceful against the kuff\u0101r, merciful  among  themselves.

ISIL\u2019s murder of two US journalists outraged the American people and exposed to the world the depravity of ISIL\u2019s ideology and tactics.  Over the weekend, we saw ISIL\u2019s murder of a British citizen. ISIL now controls a vast swath of eastern Syria and western and northern Iraq including towns and cities in all these areas.\nISIL has gained strength by exploiting the civil war in Syria and sectarian strife in Iraq.  And it has seized territory  across  both  countries  and  acquired  significant resources and advanced weapons. ISIL has employed a violent combination of terrorist, insurgent and conventional military tactics.\nISIL has been very adept at deploying technology and social media to increase its global profile and attract tens  of  thousands  of  fighters.  Its  goal  is  to  become the  new  vanguard  of  a  global  extremist  movement and establish an extremist Islamic caliphate across the Middle East. It considers itself the rightful inheritor of Osama bin Laden\u2019s legacy.\nWhile ISIL clearly poses an immediate threat to American  citizens  in  Iraq  and  our  interests  in  the  Middle East, we also know that thousands of foreign fighters, including  Europeans  and  more  than  100  Americans have travelled to Syria.  With passports that give them relative freedom of movement, these fighters can exploit ISIL\u2019s safe haven to plan, coordinate and carry out attacks against the United States and Europe.\nAlthough the intelligence community has not yet detected specific plotting against the US homeland, ISIL has  global  aspirations.  And  as  President  Obama  has made clear, ISIL\u2019s leaders have threatened America and our allies.

She  bore  me  the  most  beloved  of  people  to  me\u201d [Musannaf \u2018Abdir-Razz\u0101q].\nAfter  all  this  and  after  the  sun  of  the  Khil\u0101fah radiated once again, and the winds of victory and consolidation  blew,  and  the  Islamic  State,  by  the grace  of  its  Lord  alone,  brought  out  the  Islamic punishments and rulings of the Shar\u012b\u2019ah from the darkness of books and papers, and we truly lived them after they were buried for centuries\u2026 After all this, the ramblers dare to extend their tongues with false rumors and accusations so as to disfigure the great shar\u2019\u012b ruling and pure prophetic Sunnah titled \u201csaby\u201d? After all this, saby becomes fornication and tasarr\u012b (taking a slave-girl as a concubine) becomes rape? If only we\u2019d heard these falsehoods from the kuff\u0101r who are ignorant of our religion. Instead we hear  it  from  those  associated  with  our  Ummah, those whose names are Muhammad, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, and \u2018Al\u012b! So I say in astonishment: Are our people awake or asleep? But what really alarmed me was that some of the Islamic State supporters (may Allah forgive them) rushed to defend the Islamic State \u2013 may its honor  persist  and  may  Allah  expand  its  territory \u2013  after  the  k\u0101fir  media  touched  upon  the  State\u2019s capture  of  the  Yaz\u012bd\u012b  women.  So  the  supporters started denying the matter as if the soldiers of the Khil\u0101fah had committed a mistake or evil.\nThus, after the matter transcended its limits and the barking of the charlatans \u2013 the wicked scholars \u2013 rose upon the pulpits of deviance, it became necessary to face their declarations with a declaration, but one \ndabiq\n\fcompletely and decreed it would be so. {And fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion is completely for Allah. And if they cease \u2013 then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do} [Al-Anf\u0101l: 39]. {It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over  all  religions,  even  if  the  mushrik\u012bn  despise such} [At-Tawbah: 33]. {And sufficient is Allah as a witness} [Al-Fath: 28].\nhimself testified. {[Ibl\u012bs] said, \u201cMy Lord, because You  have  put  me  in  error,  I  will  surely  make [disobedience] attractive to them on earth, and I will mislead them all except, among them, Your sincere  servants.\u201d  [Allah]  said,  \u201cThis  is  a  path [of  return]  to  Me  [that  is]  straight.  Indeed,  My servants \u2013 no authority will you have over them, except  those  who  follow  you  of  the  deviators\u201d} [Al-Hijr: 39-42].\nAnd despite their weakness and the weakness of their  master,  Shayt\u0101n,  they  plotted  for  his  sake. And  so  they  became  the  object  of  the  firm  plot of the best and swiftest of plotters, without them realizing it. {And they plotted, but Allah plotted. And  Allah  is  the  best  of  plotters}  [\u0100l  \u2018Imr\u0101n: 54]. {Then did they feel secure from the plot of Allah?  But  no  one  feels  secure  from  the  plot  of Allah except those people in loss} [Al-A\u2019r\u0101f: 99]. {And when We give the people a taste of mercy after  adversity  has  touched  them,  at  once  they plot  against  Our  verses.  Say,  \u201cAllah  is  swifter  in plot.\u201d Indeed, Our messengers record that which you plot} [Y\u016bnus: 21]. {And I will give them time. Indeed, my plot is firm} [Al-A\u2019r\u0101f: 183]. {Or do they  intend  a  plot?  But  those  who  disbelieve  \u2013 they are the object of a plot} [At-T\u016br: 42].\nAnd Allah weakened their plots and led them to failure,  misguidance,  and  severe  error.  {Rather, their  [own]  plot  has  been  made  attractive  to those who disbelieve, and they have been averted from the way. And whomever Allah leaves astray \u2013 there will be for him no guide} [Ar-Ra\u2019d: 33]. {But they who plot evil deeds will have a severe punishment,  and  the  plotting  of  those  \u2013  it  will perish} [F\u0101tir: 10]. {And Allah does not guide the plot of betrayers} [Y\u016bsuf: 52]. {But the plot of the disbelievers is not except in error} [Gh\u0101fir: 25].\nAnd  the  outcome  of  their  plots  is  the  exact opposite  of  what  they  desire.  They  only  plotted against  themselves,  their  worldly  life,  and  their hereafter,  bringing  about  their  debasement  and self-destruction.  {And  they  plotted  a  plot,  and We plotted a plot, while they perceived not. Then look how was the outcome of their plot \u2013 that We destroyed them and their people, all. So those are \ndabiq\nThe crusader John Kerry and the IranianR\u0101fid\u012b Mohammad Javad Zarif\nBut  due  to  the  deviance  and  arrogance  of  the enemies  of  Allah,  they  plot  against  His  religion and  His  allies.  Their  plots  almost  cause  the mountains to collapse out of shock that the kuff\u0101r dare to oppose the Lord of the heavens and the earth. {And they had plotted their plot, but with Allah is their plot [recorded], even if their plot had been [sufficient] to do away with the mountains} [Ibr\u0101h\u012bm: 46].\nAnd yet their plot is inherently weak, as it is part of the weak plot of Shayt\u0101n. {Those who believe fight in  the  cause  of  Allah,  and  those  who  disbelieve fight in the cause of t\u0101gh\u016bt. So fight against the allies of Shayt\u0101n. Indeed, the plot of Shayt\u0101n has ever been weak} [An-Nis\u0101: 76].\nAnd this weakness is due to the power of sincerity \u2013  the  core  of  tawh\u012bd  \u2013  granted  by  Allah  to  the slaves  He  has  chosen,  as  the  accursed  Shayt\u0101n \n\f", "schema:headline": "FROM OUR SISTERS", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "44"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq15-The-Fitrah-of-Mankind", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "15", "schema:articleBody": "He c also said, \u201cSay, \u2018If there had been with Him [other] gods, as they say, then they would have sought to get closer to the Owner of the Throne.\u2019 He is glorified and greatly exalted above what they say. The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt Him. And there is not a thing except that it celebrates His praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting.  Indeed,  He  is  ever  Forbearing  and  Forgiving\u201d (Al-Isra 42-44).\nHe c also said, \u201cThen He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, \u2018Come both of you, willingly or by compulsion.\u2019 They said, \u2018We have come willingly\u2019\u201d (Fussilat 11). He c also said, \u201cHad there been within the heavens and earth gods besides Allah, they both would have been ruined. So exalted is Allah, Lord of the Throne, above what they describe\u201d (Al-Anbiya 22).\nIn these various verses, Allah c teaches His slaves that the universe He created manifests recognition of His lordship and worship of Him alone by exalting His  praise  and  prostrating  to  Him  solely.  This  submission only to Him is behind the uniformity in the creation and what it contains of laws decreed by Him. If the creation had taken a god alongside its creator, obeying Allah and obeying a false god, loving Allah and loving a false god, and fearing Allah and fearing a false god, order would collapse within the universe.Allah c also created man and instilled in him the fitrah,  a  disposition  to  recognize  His  lordship  and worship  Him  alone.  Allah  c  said,  \u201cSo  direct  your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of Allah.  That  is  the  correct  religion,  but  most  of  the people do not know\u201d (Ar-Rum 30).\nHe  c  made  this  fitrah  a  proof  against  mankind, saying, \u201cAnd [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam \u2013 from their loins \u2013 their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], \u2018Am I not your Lord?\u2019 They said, \u2018Yes, we have testified\u2019 \u2013 lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, \u2018Indeed, we were of this unaware.\u2019 Or [lest] you say, \u2018It was only that our fathers associated [others in worship] with Allah before, and we were but descendants after them. Then would You destroy us for what the falsifiers have done?\u2019\u201d (Al-A\u2019raf 172173).\nSigmund Freud, one of the engineers of Western decadence\nfilthiness,  between  decency  and  obscenity,  between mercy and cruelty, between justice and tyranny, between  truth  and  falsehood,  and  between  right  and wrong. In this regards, the Prophet g  said, \u201cEvery child is born upon the fitrah. His parents then make him a Jew or a Christian, just as you breed camels. Do you see any camels with their body parts mutilated until you yourselves mutilate them?\u201d Abu Hurayrah \uf068 said, \u201cRead if you wish, \u2018\u2026the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people; no change should there be in the creation of Allah\u2026\u2019\u201d (Muslim). In this regards,  Allah  c  said,  \u201c[The  polytheists]  supplicate none but a rebellious Satan, whom Allah has cursed for he had said, \u2018I will surely take a prescribed portion from among Your servants. And I will mislead them, and I will arouse in them [sinful] desires, and I will command them so they will slit the ears of cattle, and I will command them so they will change the creation of Allah.\u2019 And whoever takes Satan as an ally instead of Allah has certainly incurred a clear loss\u201d (An-Nisa 117-119).\nThus, because the fitrah stands in the face of Satan as he attempts to deviate mankind from monotheism and purity to paganism and obscenity, he strives to obliterate this fitrah, as described by Allah c in the \nSo this fitrah is what causes man to distinguish between monotheism and polytheism. It also aids him in  generally  distinguishing  between  pureness  and \n\fof Islam? \u201cVerily those who committed riddah, going back after the guidance had become clear to them, it is Satan who tempted them\u201d (Muhammad 25). \u201cAnd whoever  of  you  commits  riddah  from  his  religion, then dies as a disbeliever, then his deeds are void in this life and the next, and such are the companions of the Fire, forever therein\u201d (Al-Baqarah 217).\nRemember that Allah did not order you to adhere to any group except that of the single Muslim nation, and rather forbade you to divide by making and joining other groups, as He c said, \u201cVerily a single nation is your nation, and I am your Lord, so worship Me\u201d (Al-Anbiya 92), \u201cAnd do not be of the pagans, those who  divided  their  religion  and  became  sects,  each party delighted with itself\u201d (Ar-Rum 32), \u201cAnd hold tightly to the rope of Allah and do not separate\u201d (Al \u2018Imran 103), and, \u201cHe has called you \u2018Muslims\u2019\u201d (AlHajj 78). That one nation is the group following the Quran and the Sunnah, with allegiance to one leader, the Caliph of the Muslims. Referring to when there shall appear \u201ccallers to the gates of Hell,\u201d who are \u201cof our skin and our language\u201d and whose followers will be thrown into the Fire, our Prophet g commanded that we \u201cadhere to the group of the Muslims and their leader\u201d (Al-Bukhari and Muslim); yes, the single group of the Muslims and their single leader, around whom they unite and fulfill Allah\u2019s command, \u201cO you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those of authority amongst you\u201d (An-Nisa 59).\nDo you not see the many so-called \u201cimams\u201d and \u201cscholars\u201d calling to alliances against Islam with the disbelievers, to maintaining the Muslim nation\u2019s separation by imaginary borders, and to rejecting the reestablishment  of  the  Caliphate,  which  many  of  the earlier scholars called \u201cthe most important of obligations?!\u201d Are these imams not \u201cof our skin and our language,\u201d yet call to what would inevitably lead to our doom? Indeed, they are callers to the gates of Hell, so beware and do not be fooled by them.\nSo reject these calls to disunity and come together. Live the life of Islam, for which you have already left the path of falsehood, and do not die the death of  Jahiliyyah,  a  time  in  which  there  was  no  united Muslim nation having pledged allegiance to a single imam and thus having no obedience to a rightful authority. Indeed, the Prophet g said, \u201cWhoever dies unbound by a bay\u2019ah (pledge of allegiance) has died a jahili death\u201d (Muslim). And he said, \u201cWhoever dislikes something in his leader, let him be patient. For whoever leaves the obedience of lawful authority, even \nBeware of dying as an apostate\na hand span (and dies), has died the death of Jahiliyyah\u201d (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nAt the onset of Ramadan in 1435, the mujahidin, who were engaging fierce battles against the Crusaders, their allies, and their puppets in Iraq and the Levant, reached a level where all conditions required to announce the Caliphate were met. So with great joy, the lost obligation was revived and the Muslim world could once again be united, by Allah\u2019s grace, around a single imam, Ibrahim Ibn \u2018Awwad al-Badri \uf085.\nRegardless of where you are, know that pledging allegiance is an obligation upon you, as is listening to your leader, the Caliph, and obeying his command. Allah\u2019s Messenger g said, \u201cThe Muslim must listen and obey in what he loves and what he hates, as long as he is not commanded with a sin. If he is commanded with a sin, there is neither listening nor obeying (in that sin)\u201d (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nRush to perform hijrah (emigration) to the land of Islam, where the Shari\u2019ah is in full application. Hijrah is a sign of both one\u2019s love for unity and his adherence to the Sunnah of Allah\u2019s Messenger g. This was reiterated as a direct order from Amirul-Muminin, who said, \u201cO Muslims everywhere, whoever is capable of performing hijrah to the Islamic State, then let him do so, because hijrah to the land of Islam is obligatory\u201d (A Message to the Mujahidin and the Muslim Ummah).\nBut  if  you  are  unable  to  do  so,  then  know  that \n\f", "schema:headline": "The Fitrah of Mankind", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "20"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq12-ADVICE-TO-THE-MUJ\u0100HID\u012aN:-LISTEN-AND-OBEY", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "12", "schema:articleBody": "[This article was first published in \u201cSawtul-Jih\u0101d,\u201d former magazine of al-Q\u0101\u2019idah in the Arabian Peninsula (before the partisan Yemeni branch).

And from the incidents that attest to his protective jealousy for Islam and its people is that after engaging in a debate with a Madkhal\u012b (a pro-Saudi \u201cSalaf\u012b\u201d) in one of the \u201cmas\u0101jid\u201d in the lands of kufr, the Madkhal\u012b remarked regarding the abuses of the spiteful Jews against our sisters in Palestine that the women \u201cdeserved it.\u201d Ab\u016b Muh\u0101rib had to be restrained from hitting this Madkhal\u012b by other worshippers at the \u201cmasjid.\u201d A brother who witnessed the incident recalled, \u201cAb\u016b Muh\u0101rib began to weep loudly. I watched him in his prayer weeping in suj\u016bd as if he had lost a loved one.\u201d\nAnd amongst the deeds that attest to his affection towards the orphans is that following the martyrdom of Bil\u0101l al-Barj\u0101w\u012b, Ab\u016b Muh\u0101rib would frequently visit his orphaned son, taking him to the mas\u0101jid and entertaining him with trips out to the park and the zoo. He would also teach Qur\u2019\u0101n to other sons of shuhad\u0101\u2019. {Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those with him are forceful against the kuff\u0101r, merciful  among  themselves.  You  see  them  bowing  and prostrating, seeking bounty from Allah and [His] pleasure. Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. That is their description in the Tawr\u0101h. And their description in the Inj\u012bl is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers \u2013 so that Allah may enrage by them the kuff\u0101r. Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward} [Al-Fath: 29].\nOn Thursday, the 29th of Muharram, 1437, Ab\u016b Muh\u0101rib finally achieved shah\u0101dah for the cause of Allah, which he had sought for so long, as the car he was in was targeted in a strike by an unmanned drone in the city of ar-Raqqah, destroying the car and killing him instantly. May Allah accept our  brother  among  the  shuhad\u0101\u2019,  envelop  him  with  His mercy, and enter him into the highest levels of al-Firdaws.\n\fnor is she to dye her hair or apply kohl\u201d [Reported by Ab\u016b D\u0101w\u016bd and an-Nas\u0101\u2019\u012b from Umm Salamah].\nA woman came to the Messenger of Allah \uf067 and said, \u201cO Messenger  of  Allah,  my  daughter\u2019s  husband  passed  away and she complains of pain in her eye. Should I apply kohl to her?\u201d The Messenger of Allah \uf067 said, \u201cNo,\u201d two or three times  [Reported  by  al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b  and  Muslim  from  Umm Salamah].\nIbn \u2018Abb\u0101s \uf06b said, \u201cHe would forbid the one whose husband  passed  away  from  using  perfume  and  adornment\u201d [Musannaf  Ibn  Ab\u012b  Shaybah].\nAs for the use of dyes in clothing, then those \u201cthat are not intended for adornment \u2013 like the color black or what is dyed  to  make  something  look  less  appealing  or  to  cover up  blemishes  \u2013  are  not  prohibited\u201d  [Z\u0101d  al-Ma\u2019\u0101d  \u2013  Ibnul-Qayyim]. Ibnul-Mundhir r (died 319AH) also said that both M\u0101lik and ash-Sh\u0101fi\u2019\u012b considered it permissible for the mourning widow to wear black \u201cbecause it is not an adornment and it is the clothing of grief\u201d [Naylul-Awt\u0101r \u2013 Ash-Shawk\u0101n\u012b]. And Allah knows best.\nAdditionally,  the  mourning  widow  must  complete  her \u2018iddah in the house in which she lived when her husband died, whether it is his property or a rental. The sister of Ab\u016b Sa\u2019\u012bd al-Khudr\u012b \uf06b went to the Messenger of Allah \uf067 to ask him for permission to return to her family from Ban\u012b Khudrah, explaining that her husband went out searching for some runaway slaves, but was killed by them when he found them. She said, \u201cI asked Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 that I return to my family, as my husband left me no home and no spending money.\u201d The Messenger of Allah \uf067 approved, but when she left, he called for her and said, \u201cWhat did you ask?\u201d She repeated the story about her husband to him. He said, \u201cStay in your house in which you received the news of your husband\u2019s death until the appointed time is reached.\u201d She said, \u201cSo I counted my \u2018iddah therein for four months and ten days.\u201d She continued, \u201cThen when \u2018Uthm\u0101n asked me about that [during his khil\u0101fah], I informed him of the matter. So he adhered to it and ruled accordingly\u201d [Reported in the four Sunan and declared sah\u012bh by at-Tirmidh\u012b, Ibn Hibb\u0101n, and al-H\u0101kim].\nAt-Tirmidh\u012b r said, \u201cThis had\u012bth is hasan sah\u012bh and most of the scholars from the Sah\u0101bah and others acted thereon. They did not allow the woman in her \u2018iddah to move from her husband\u2019s house until her \u2018iddah ended. This is the opinion of Sufy\u0101n ath-Thawr\u012b, ash-Sh\u0101fi\u2019\u012b, Ahmad, and Ish\u0101q.\u201d\nSo this had\u012bth proves that the mourning widow must stay in the home in which she resided with her husband. This is the opinion of most scholars. \u2018Uthm\u0101n Ibn \u2018Aff\u0101n \u2013 the Rightly-Guided Khal\u012bfah \u2013 also ruled according to this in \nthe presence of the Muh\u0101jir\u012bn and the Ans\u0101r. It was also the opinion of the second Rightly-Guided Khal\u012bfah \u2018Umar and his son, as well as Ibn Mas\u2019\u016bd and others from the Sah\u0101bah, may Allah be pleased with all of them.\nAs such, it is har\u0101m for the mourning widow to move from her home to another except with a lawful excuse, as was explained by Ibn Qud\u0101mah, who said, \u201cIf she fears demolition of the house, drowning therein, an approaching enemy, or something along these lines, or the owner of the house wishes to move her elsewhere, such as him lending the house then changing his mind, or its lease has ended, or he wrongfully expels her from the house or refuses to renew the lease, or he demands more than its going price, or she cannot afford it except from her own wealth, then she is allowed to move, as such situations are excusable and she is not required to pay for housing [from her own wealth], but her only obligation is that of residing there, not in obtaining the place itself. If she is unable to reside there [for reasons mentioned earlier], the obligation falls\u201d [Al-Mughn\u012b].\nAnd while the mourning widow spends her \u2018iddah residing at her husband\u2019s home, if she has any needs to attend to, then she can do so during the day, as night is a time that causes suspicions to arise. But, if she can find someone to run errands and take care of other needs for her, then the best place for her is her home. When she does go out for a need, she has to be back by maghrib (sunset). Lastly, she can\u2019t sleep anywhere except at her home.\nIbn \u2018Umar \uf06b said, \u201cIt is not right that she should spend a single night, during the \u2018iddah of either death or divorce, except in her home\u201d [Musannaf \u2018Abdir-Razz\u0101q].\nAnd while Ibn \u2018Umar\u2019s daughter \uf06b was in her \u2018iddah after the passing away of her husband, she would visit her family during the day and speak with them; but as night fell, he would order her to return to her house [Musannaf \u2018Abdir-Razz\u0101q].\nLikewise, some women from Hamd\u0101n who were informed of their husbands passing away told Ibn Mas\u2019\u016bd h, \u201cWe are feeling very lonely.\u201d So he said to them, \u201cGather with one another during the day, then each woman should return to her home at night\u201d [Musannaf \u2018Abdir-Razz\u0101q]. Of course, such gatherings should not become the norm, in adherence to the \u0101yah, {And abide in your houses} [Al-Ahz\u0101b: 33]. These gatherings should also be free of gossip, backbiting, and other sins. And the mourning widow must observe the rulings of ihd\u0101d therein. These occasional gatherings ought to serve a purpose such as worship, learning the religion, or keeping family ties.\nThus,  the  mourning  widow  should  remember  that  the Muslim\u0101t \u2013 widows or not \u2013 do not leave their homes ex-\n\f", "schema:headline": "AMONG THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "22"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq13-THE-R\u0100FIDAH:-FROM-IBN-SABA\u2019-TO-THE-DAJJ\u0100L", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "13", "schema:articleBody": "The R\u0101fidah and the Jews\nWho Was Ibn Saba\u2019?\nThe Jew Ibn Saba\u2019, like Paul, hated Islam and desired to deviate the Muslims and corrupt their religion by innovating deviant concepts including the godhood, lordship, and second coming of \u2018Al\u012b Ibn Ab\u012b T\u0101lib h. At the same time, he strived to create strife amongst the Muslim ranks, inciting against the Righteous Khal\u012bfah \u2018Uthm\u0101n h until \u2018Uthm\u0101n was killed. The killing of \u2018Uthm\u0101n led to the deaths of more Muslims and the eventual emergence of the Khaw\u0101rij, who assassinated \u2018Al\u012b h, who Ibn Saba\u2019 had once claimed was Allah!\nAbout him, Ibn Taymiyyah r said, \u201cThe first to innovate Rafd was a heretical hypocrite named \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn Saba\u2019. He wanted thereby to corrupt the religion of the Muslims like Paul \u2013 the author of the letters read by the Christians \u2013 innovated for the Christians heresies by which he corrupted their religion. Paul was a Jew who hypocritically faked Christianity with the intent to corrupt it. Ibn Saba\u2019 was also a Jew intending the same. He strived to spread falsehood aiming to corrupt the religion, but was unable to do so. However,  some  discord  and  strife  occurred  amongst  the Muslims, strife in which \u2018Uthm\u0101n h was killed. Thereafter the fitnah transpired\u201d [Majm\u016b\u2019 al-Fat\u0101w\u0101].\nAt-Tabar\u012b r said in his t\u0101r\u012bkh, \u201cIbn Saba\u2019 adopted Islam during the khil\u0101fah of \u2018Uthm\u0101n. He then toured the Muslims\u2019 lands, trying to deviate them. He started with al-Hij\u0101z, then al-Basrah, then al-K\u016bfah, then ash-Sh\u0101m. He did not succeed in launching his plot amongst the people of Sh\u0101m. They eventually expelled him. He then went to Egypt and called its people. Amongst what he said to them was, \u2018How strange are a people who claim that \u2018\u012as\u0101 will return but deny that  Muhammad  will  return,  whereas  Allah \uf062  said,  {Indeed,  He  who  imposed  upon  you  the  Qur\u2019\u0101n  will  bring you back to a returning place} [Al-Qasas: 85].2 Therefore, 2   The scholars of tafs\u012br say that the verse was a promise to the Prophet \uf067 that he would once again return to Makkah after being forced out from it.\nThe T\u0101bi\u2019\u012b ash-Sha\u2019b\u012b r (died 104AH) said, \u201cI warn you against the followers of deviant desires. And the worst of them are the R\u0101fidah, as they are the Jews of this Ummah. Some of them are Jews who fake Islam to spread their deviance, just as Paul of the Jews faked Christianity to spread his deviance, hoping the Jews would become victorious. The R\u0101fidah hate Islam just as the Jews hate Christianity. They did not enter Islam longing for Allah or fearing Him, rather out of spite for the people of Islam and so as to  inflict  harm  upon  them.  Their  prayers  do  no  exceed their ears. Indeed, \u2018Al\u012b h burned them alive and banished them  to  other  lands.  Amongst  them  was  \u2018Abdull\u0101h  Ibn Saba\u2019, a Jew from the Jews of Sanaa, who was banished to S\u0101b\u0101t.\u201d\nHe r also said, \u201cIndeed, the calamity of the R\u0101fidah is the same as the calamity of the Jews. The Jews say that only a person from the lineage of D\u0101w\u016bd is suited for kingship. The R\u0101fidah say that only a person from the lineage of \u2018Al\u012b is suited for im\u0101mah. The Jews say that there is no jih\u0101d until the Messiah comes forth and a sword descends from the heavens. The R\u0101fidah say there is no jih\u0101d until the Mahd\u012b comes forth and a caller calls out from the heavens saying, \u2018Follow him.\u2019 The Jews distorted the Tawr\u0101h. The R\u0101fidah did the same, distorting the Qur\u2019\u0101n. The Jews are not truthful when they say sal\u0101m to the believers, rather they say, \u2018May s\u0101m be upon you.\u2019 And s\u0101m means death. The R\u0101fidah are the same. The Jews consider the wealth of all people to be hal\u0101l, as Allah described them in the Qur\u2019\u0101n as saying, {\u201cThere is no blame upon us concerning the illiterate [meaning the Arabs]\u201d} [\u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 75]. The R\u0101fidah are the same, as they consider the wealth of all Muslims to be hal\u0101l. The Jews consider the blood of all Muslims to be hal\u0101l. The R\u0101fidah  are  the  same.  The  Jews  consider  the  cheating  of people to be hal\u0101l. The R\u0101fidah are the same. The Jews hate Jibr\u012bl and say he is their enemy from amongst the angels. The R\u0101fidah are the same, as some of them claim that Jibr\u012bl mistakenly descended with revelation upon Muhammad \uf067 and abandoned \u2018Al\u012b h.\u201d1\nThis is a reality of which there is no doubt. The Jews and the R\u0101fidah are two sides of the same coin. The religion of Rafd (\u201cShiism\u201d) was nothing but a plot by a Jew \u2013 Ibn Saba\u2019 \u2013 following the footsteps of his Jewish predecessor Paul, who had corrupted the pure religion of the Messiah \uf06e, leaving the Christians upon the Pauline deviance and heresies of the cross, original sin, incarnation, atonement, the lordship, divine sonhood, and godhead of the Messiah, and antinomianism (abandonment of the Law of M\u016bs\u0101 \uf06e).\n1   The various statements of ash-Sha\u2019b\u012b were reported by al-Khall\u0101l in \u201cAs-Sunnah,\u201d  al-L\u0101lik\u0101\u2019\u012b  in  \u201cSharh  Us\u016bl  al-I\u2019tiq\u0101d,\u201d  Ibn Taymiyyah  in \u201cMinh\u0101j  as-Sunnah,\u201d  and  others.\nThe R\u0101fidah of Iran dedicate a memorial  to  dead  Iranian  Jews\n\f\u201cISIS poses a major threat to the U.S. and to U.S. interests abroad, and that threat is growing every day. The nature and significance of the threat flow from the fact that ISIS is \u2013 all at the same time \u2013 a terrorist group, a state and a revolutionary political movement. We have never faced an adversary like it.\u201d\n\u201cAs a terrorist group, ISIS poses a threat to the homeland. That threat is largely indirect and involves ISIS\u2019s ability to radicalize  young  Americans  to  conduct  attacks  here.  The FBI has over 900 open investigations into homegrown extremists, the vast majority radicalized by ISIS, and a large number  of  those  investigations  relate  to  individuals  who may be plotting here\u2026\u201d\n\u201c[T]he potential exists for the quantity of \u2026 [homegrown] attacks to be large. The number of ISIS followers dwarfs the number of followers that al-Qaeda ever had. Over time, the indirect threat, if not significantly degraded, will become a direct one \u2013 that is, ISIS will have the ability to plan and direct attacks on the homeland from the group\u2019s safe havens in Iraq and Syria, just like it did in Paris.\u201d\n\u201cSuch attacks are deeply concerning because they carry the potential to be much more sophisticated and complex \u2013 and therefore more dangerous \u2013 than homegrown attacks, again,  just  like  in  Paris  recently,  or  London  in  2005  or even 9/11. And in news that should get everyone\u2019s attention, ISIS has shown an interest in weapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n\u201cThe attacks in Paris were the first manifestation of an effort by ISIS to put together an attack capability in Europe \u2013 an effort it began less than a year ago. The head of the U.K.\u2019s domestic security agency recently warned that ISIS is now planning mass-casualty attacks in Britain. His concerns are well-founded. We will not be far behind.\u201d\n\u201cAs a state, ISIS poses a threat to regional stability \u2013 a threat to the very territorial integrity of the current nation-states, a threat to inflame the entire region in sectarian war\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAs a revolutionary political movement, ISIS is gaining affiliates among extremist groups around the world. They are signing up for what ISIS desires as its objective: a global caliphate where day-to-day life is governed by extreme religious views. In the mind of ISIS, its global caliphate would extend to the U.S.\u201d\n\u201cWhen they join ISIS, these affiliates evolve from focusing on local issues to focusing on establishing an extension of the caliphate. And their targets evolve from local to international ones. This is the story of the bombing of the Russian airline by an ISIS group in the Egyptian Sinai.\u201d\n\u201cISIS  has  gained  affiliates  faster  than  al-Qaeda  ever  did. From none a year ago, there are now militant groups that have sworn allegiance to ISIS in nearly 20 countries. They have conducted attacks that have killed Americans, and they carry the potential to grab large amounts of territory\u2026\u201d\nMorell ended his article saying:\n\u201cMr. President, the downing of the Russian airliner and the attacks in Paris make it crystal clear that our ISIS strategy is not working.\u201d\nYes, the crusader strategy is not working because the Islamic State is here to stay. It is a state that inflicts just terror against its infidel, pagan, and apostate enemies. And it will continue to expand until its banner flutters over Constantinople and Rome. Until then, let the crusaders get used to the sound of explosion and the image of carnage in their very own homelands.\nSan  Bernardino  was  not  the  first, and by Allah\u2019s permission it will not be  the  last\n\f", "schema:headline": "THE R\u0100FIDAH: FROM IBN SABA\u2019 TO THE DAJJ\u0100L", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "32"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq12-IN-THE-WORDS-OF-THE-ENEMY", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "12", "schema:articleBody": "On 25 Dhul-Qa\u2019dah 1436, Ab\u016b Fir\u0101s as-S\u016br\u012b \u2013 formerly official spokesman of the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front, currently a Jawl\u0101n\u012b front leader and head of its \u201cshar\u2019\u012b academies\u201d \u2013 published an article exposing the deviance of the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front\u2019s allies and consequently his own deviance and that of his party.

When announced, \n\fAb\u016b  Junaydah,  whose  parents  are  from  Morocco,  grew up in the crusader country of Germany. Like most youth from migrant families, he was somewhat distant from his religion despite his father and mother both then being religious Muslims. And although life in d\u0101rul-kufr led many Muslim youth to abandon the daily prayers, Ab\u016b Junaydah was an exception. No matter what he faced in life, he would never forget sal\u0101h.\nWhen  he  was  a  child,  his  father  made  him  memorize some of the Qur\u2019\u0101n and go with him to the masjid. When he grew older, he appreciated this discipline as due to it, he had learned much of the book of Allah.\nAnd so Allah guides whomever He wills and He showed His mercy towards Ab\u016b Junaydah, guiding him to serious practice at the age of eighteen. He began to learn his religion on his own effort and distance himself from all bad influences. He also married early to protect himself from the traps of zin\u0101. Shortly after, Allah bestowed him with a daughter, whom he named Junaydah.\nSaddened by the events in Sh\u0101m and the crimes committed against Ahlus-Sunnah, he resolved to perform hijrah there to partake in the jih\u0101d.\nIn \u201c2013,\u201d he travelled to Sh\u0101m and joined the faction called \u201cJun\u016bd ash-Sh\u0101m,\u201d led by the deviant liar Muslim ash-Sh\u012bsh\u0101n\u012b. Upon arrival, Ab\u016b Junaydah was very happy to have arrived to the lands of jih\u0101d, but he quickly found out that not every \u201cmuj\u0101hid\u201d and not every \u201cjih\u0101d\u012b\u201d faction is on the sound manhaj. He and the other muj\u0101hid\u012bn were forbidden from pronouncing takf\u012br upon the t\u0101gh\u016bt Erdogan and the other taw\u0101gh\u012bt of Turkey for reasons of \u201cmaslahah.\u201d Similarly, they were forbidden from pronouncing takf\u012br upon the \u201cFree Syrian Army\u201d (FSA). He witnessed how he himself as well as the Islamic State were strongly criticized for this. There were also many situations in which the law of Allah was violated by the local factions; the people weren\u2019t being judged by the Shar\u012b\u2019ah. In one of these cases, for example, a local person insulted Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) and did not receive punishment for his crime.\nWhile he was with Jun\u016bd ash-Sh\u0101m, he was joined by his best friend Ab\u016b Luqm\u0101n al-Alm\u0101n\u012b and Ab\u016b Junaydah\u2019s \n5555\nAMONGST THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN\ncousin Ab\u016b Hafs al-Alm\u0101n\u012b in order to wage jih\u0101d against the taw\u0101gh\u012bt everywhere and their allies. But Ab\u016b Luqm\u0101n and Ab\u016b Hafs did not stay long with Jun\u016bd ash-Sh\u0101m, as they  quickly  recognized  the  corrupt  and  deviant  manhaj of  the  faction  and  understood  that  they  should  join  the Jam\u0101\u2019ah. Thus they both gave bay\u2019ah to Am\u012brul-Mu\u2019min\u012bn Ab\u016b Bakr al-Husayn\u012b al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (hafidhahull\u0101h), joining the Islamic State.\nOn the day of the Sahwah treachery, Ab\u016b Luqm\u0101n and Ab\u016b Hafs were captured by the FSA and imprisoned with hundreds of other muh\u0101jir\u012bn. But they deceived their captors into releasing them. This led them to meet Ab\u016b Junaydah again, who had abandoned Jun\u016bd ash-Sh\u0101m for the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front shortly before the Sahwah. He began to work in the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front\u2019s media department.\nBecause of Ab\u016b Sulaym\u0101n the Australian\u2019s lies, Ab\u016b Junaydah had some misconceptions about the Islamic State, but his heart was longing to join the Jam\u0101\u2019ah, to be on its side while the whole world had assembled against it militarily, politically, economically, and even in the media realm. He also began catching many contradictions in the claims of Ab\u016b  Sulaym\u0101n  the  Australian  and  his  Sahwah  comrades against the Islamic State. In addition to this, Ab\u016b Hafs \u2013 who was stuck in Halab after his release from the early Sahwah prisons \u2013 would regularly advise Ab\u016b Junaydah to join the Islamic State.\nAnd Allah guides whomever He wills. Ab\u016b Junaydah listened to the speeches of the senile and deviant Dhaw\u0101hir\u012b and those of the former war minister of the Islamic State, Shaykh Ab\u016b Hamzah al-Muh\u0101jir r.

Indeed, Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful} [Al-Ahz\u0101b:  24].\u201d\nHe then mentions some \u0101y\u0101t about the Battle of Uhud in order to draw comparisons between the reason for the breakdown in the Muslim ranks during the Battle of Uhud, and the reason for the breakdown in the Muslim ranks during the course of the Mongol invasion. He says, \u201cAllah said, {Indeed, those of you who turned back on the day the two armies met, it was Shayt\u0101n who caused them to slip because of some [blame] they had earned. But Allah has already forgiven them. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing} [\u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 155]. Allah c also said, {And Allah had certainly fulfilled His promise to you when you were killing the enemy by His permission until [the time] when you lost courage and fell to disputing about the order [given by the Prophet] and disobeyed after He had shown you that which you love. Among you are some who desire this world, and among you are some who desire the Hereafter. Then he turned you back from them [defeated] that He might test you. And He has already forgiven you, and Allah is the possessor of bounty for the believers} [\u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 152]. Allah also said, {Why [is it that] when a [single] disaster struck you [on the day of Uhud], although you had struck \n[the enemy in the battle of Badr] with one twice as great, you said, \u2018From where is this?\u2019 Say, \u2018It is from yourselves.\u2019 Indeed, Allah is over all things competent} [\u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 165]. [During the course of the battle,] the Shayt\u0101n shouted to the people, \u2018Muhammad has been killed.\u2019 So among them were those who were shaken and fled, and among them were those who stood firm and fought. So Allah said, {Muhammad is not but a messenger. [Other] messengers have passed on before him. So if he were to die or be killed, would you turn back on your heels [to unbelief]? And he who turns back on his heels will never harm Allah at all; but Allah  will  reward  the  grateful}  [\u0100l  \u2018Imr\u0101n:  144].  And this was similar to the condition of the Muslims when they broke down last year.\u201d\nHe then mentioned that the defeat of the Muslims in his times was due to sins, bad intentions, boasting, conceitedness, etc., and then said, \u201cSo it was out of Allah\u2019s wisdom and His mercy upon the believers that He afflicted them with the trials He had afflicted them with, so that Allah may purify the believers and they may return to their Lord in repentance \u2026 Just as Allah\u2019s support for the Muslims on the day of Badr was a mercy and a blessing and their defeat on the day  of  Uhud  was  a  blessing  and  a  mercy  upon  the believers, for indeed the Prophet g said, \u2018Allah does not decree anything for the believer except that it is good.

The sister of Ab\u016b Sa\u2019\u012bd al-Khudr\u012b \uf06b went to the Messenger of Allah \uf067 to ask him for permission to return to her family from Ban\u012b Khudrah, explaining that her husband went out searching for some runaway slaves, but was killed by them when he found them. She said, \u201cI asked Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 that I return to my family, as my husband left me no home and no spending money.\u201d The Messenger of Allah \uf067 approved, but when she left, he called for her and said, \u201cWhat did you ask?\u201d She repeated the story about her husband to him. He said, \u201cStay in your house in which you received the news of your husband\u2019s death until the appointed time is reached.\u201d She said, \u201cSo I counted my \u2018iddah therein for four months and ten days.\u201d She continued, \u201cThen when \u2018Uthm\u0101n asked me about that [during his khil\u0101fah], I informed him of the matter. So he adhered to it and ruled accordingly\u201d [Reported in the four Sunan and declared sah\u012bh by at-Tirmidh\u012b, Ibn Hibb\u0101n, and al-H\u0101kim].\nAt-Tirmidh\u012b r said, \u201cThis had\u012bth is hasan sah\u012bh and most of the scholars from the Sah\u0101bah and others acted thereon. They did not allow the woman in her \u2018iddah to move from her husband\u2019s house until her \u2018iddah ended. This is the opinion of Sufy\u0101n ath-Thawr\u012b, ash-Sh\u0101fi\u2019\u012b, Ahmad, and Ish\u0101q.\u201d\nSo this had\u012bth proves that the mourning widow must stay in the home in which she resided with her husband. This is the opinion of most scholars. \u2018Uthm\u0101n Ibn \u2018Aff\u0101n \u2013 the Rightly-Guided Khal\u012bfah \u2013 also ruled according to this in \nthe presence of the Muh\u0101jir\u012bn and the Ans\u0101r. It was also the opinion of the second Rightly-Guided Khal\u012bfah \u2018Umar and his son, as well as Ibn Mas\u2019\u016bd and others from the Sah\u0101bah, may Allah be pleased with all of them.\nAs such, it is har\u0101m for the mourning widow to move from her home to another except with a lawful excuse, as was explained by Ibn Qud\u0101mah, who said, \u201cIf she fears demolition of the house, drowning therein, an approaching enemy, or something along these lines, or the owner of the house wishes to move her elsewhere, such as him lending the house then changing his mind, or its lease has ended, or he wrongfully expels her from the house or refuses to renew the lease, or he demands more than its going price, or she cannot afford it except from her own wealth, then she is allowed to move, as such situations are excusable and she is not required to pay for housing [from her own wealth], but her only obligation is that of residing there, not in obtaining the place itself. If she is unable to reside there [for reasons mentioned earlier], the obligation falls\u201d [Al-Mughn\u012b].\nAnd while the mourning widow spends her \u2018iddah residing at her husband\u2019s home, if she has any needs to attend to, then she can do so during the day, as night is a time that causes suspicions to arise. But, if she can find someone to run errands and take care of other needs for her, then the best place for her is her home. When she does go out for a need, she has to be back by maghrib (sunset). Lastly, she can\u2019t sleep anywhere except at her home.\nIbn \u2018Umar \uf06b said, \u201cIt is not right that she should spend a single night, during the \u2018iddah of either death or divorce, except in her home\u201d [Musannaf \u2018Abdir-Razz\u0101q].\nAnd while Ibn \u2018Umar\u2019s daughter \uf06b was in her \u2018iddah after the passing away of her husband, she would visit her family during the day and speak with them; but as night fell, he would order her to return to her house [Musannaf \u2018Abdir-Razz\u0101q].\nLikewise, some women from Hamd\u0101n who were informed of their husbands passing away told Ibn Mas\u2019\u016bd h, \u201cWe are feeling very lonely.\u201d So he said to them, \u201cGather with one another during the day, then each woman should return to her home at night\u201d [Musannaf \u2018Abdir-Razz\u0101q]. Of course, such gatherings should not become the norm, in adherence to the \u0101yah, {And abide in your houses} [Al-Ahz\u0101b: 33]. These gatherings should also be free of gossip, backbiting, and other sins. And the mourning widow must observe the rulings of ihd\u0101d therein. These occasional gatherings ought to serve a purpose such as worship, learning the religion, or keeping family ties.\nThus,  the  mourning  widow  should  remember  that  the Muslim\u0101t \u2013 widows or not \u2013 do not leave their homes ex-\n\fevery  individual  from  your  Ummah  is,  {So  fight  in  the cause  of  Allah;  you  are  not  held  responsible  except  for yourself}.\u2019 And for this reason, it is incumbent on every believer to wage jih\u0101d, even if he has to do so alone. And in that regard is the statement of the Prophet \uf067, \u2018By Allah, I will surely fight them even if I\u2019m alone\u2019 [Reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b from al-Miswar and Marw\u0101n], and also the statement of Ab\u016b Bakr when the apostasy occurred, \u2018And if my right hand were to oppose me, I would wage jih\u0101d against it with my left hand.\u2019\u2019\u201d\nThis statement of al-Qurtub\u012b, along with those of other mufassir\u012bn, highlights the magnitude of what the believers have been burdened with. The matter of believing in Allah and then striving to raise high His kalimah \u2013 l\u0101 il\u0101ha illall\u0101h \u2013 is so significant that if one had no choice but to march forth and fight by himself to achieve this, he would have to do so. As such, Allah \uf063 reminds His Messenger \uf067 and the believers that each individual is only responsible for himself. He should not look around and base his decision to make hijrah and wage jih\u0101d for the cause of Allah on what other people are doing. Nor should he hesitate to strike the enemies of Allah \uf063 if it\u2019s within his means to do so, even if he were alone.\nOn the statement of Allah, {You are not held responsible except for yourself}, Ibn Kath\u012br mentions a report from Ibn Ab\u012b H\u0101tim that al-Bar\u0101\u2019 Ibn \u2018\u0100zib h was asked if a man who encountered a hundred of the enemy and fought them was considered to be from those about whom Allah said, {And do not throw yourselves with your own hands into destruction} [Al-Baqarah: 195]. He replied, \u201cAllah \uf063 said to His Prophet, {So fight in the cause of Allah; you are not held responsible except for yourself. And encourage the believers [to fight]}.\u201d\nThus, the believer should be prepared to fight alone when necessary  and  to  incite  others  to  join  him  in  jih\u0101d.  He should  not  be  discouraged  by  a  lack  of  numbers  and should  understand  that  the  rewards  of  a  good  deed  are multiplied  when  one  faces  greater  difficulty  in  carrying them out, as is the case when one finds no one to support him in fighting the kuff\u0101r, yet courageously marches forward and terrorizes the enemies of Allah nonetheless.\nIn his tafs\u012br of the aforementioned \u0101yah, al-Qurtub\u012b then explains the statement of Allah {That perhaps Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve}, saying, \u201cAllah restrained the might of the mushrik\u012bn at Badr as-Sughr\u0101 (the  Minor  Badr)  and  they  went  back  on  what  they promised the Prophet \uf067 of war and fighting1  \u2026 Allah 1   The Minor Badr refers to an appointment for battle between the Prophet \uf067 and the mushrik\u012bn of Quraysh two years after the decisive battle of Badr. The Prophet \uf067 and his companions camped at Badr for eight days waiting for the enemy to arrive. The mushrik\u012bn halted their march towards Badr when they reached the area of Marr adh-Dhahr\u0101n, \n{And Allah is greater in might and stronger in punishment} [An-Nis\u0101\u2019: 84]\nalso sufficed the believers at al-Hudaybiyah of what the mushrik\u012bn sought to carry out of treachery and opportunism. Thus, the believers sensed their plot and headed out, capturing them as prisoners, and this occurred as the envoys were going between them to negotiate a truce.2 This is  what  is  intended  by  His  \uf063  statement,  {And  it  is  He who withheld their hands from you} [Al-Fath: 24] \u2026 And Allah  cast  terror  into  the  hearts  of  the  factions  [during al-Khandaq]  and  they  departed  without  any  killing  or fighting, as He  \uf063 said, {And Allah spared the believers from having to fight}. Likewise, the Jews left their homes and their wealth [near al-Mad\u012bnah] without the Muslims battling  them.  So  all  this  is  might  that  Allah  restrained from afflicting the believers, in addition to a large number of Jews and Christians leaving off war and entering into the jizyah agreement in humiliation and submissively. Thus, Allah restrained their might from the believers.\u201d\nThese words altogether carry a monumental lesson for the \nand decided to forego the battle and return to Makkah due to their fear.2   This refers to an incident that took place when the Prophet \uf067 was encamped  outside  Makkah  as  the  treaty  of  Hudaybiyah  was  being negotiated with Quraysh. The more zealous youth of Quraysh saw that their leaders wanted a treaty with the Prophet \uf067, so they sought to devise a plan that would ruin the negotiations. They decided to head out at night and stealthily move towards the Muslim encampment where they would take action and attempt to ignite a war. Around seventy or eighty of them went out and descended from Mount at-Tan\u2019\u012bm, attempting to sneak towards the Muslim camp, but were all captured by Muhammad Ibn Maslamah, the commander of the Muslim guard. The Prophet \uf067 later freed them all to ensure the successful negotiation of the treaty. In this regard, Allah \uf063 revealed the \u0101yah, {And it is He who withheld their hands from you and your hands from them within the area of Makkah after He caused you to overcome them} [Al-Fath: 24].\n\f", "schema:headline": "TO OUR SISTERS: ADVICE ON IHD\u0100D", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "24"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah5", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq7-THE-BURNING-OF-THE-MURTADD-PILOT", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "7", "schema:articleBody": "THE MURTADD PILOT WAS KILLED IN RETALIATION FOR AIRSTRIKES AGAINST MUSLIMS SUCH AS THOSE PICTURED ABOVE\nIn  executing  the  muj\u0101hid\u012bn,  Jordan  is  merely hastening  the its t\u0101gh\u016bt regime.\ninevitable  destruction  of \nAllah\u2019s Messenger (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) said,  \u201cWhoever  harms  an  ally  of  Mine,  then I  have  declared  war  against  him\u201d  [Sah\u012bh  alBukh\u0101r\u012b].\nWhile the execution of S\u0101jidah and Ziy\u0101d became the focus of international headlines, the focus for many ignorant hizbiyy\u012bn became the manner in which the pilot was executed.

As for what follows\u2026\nMy dear muj\u0101hid brother, these are some pieces of advice that I\u2019ve gathered from the mouths of men and the pages of books, although I do not claim to be a man of wisdom. I ask Allah to make you and me benefit from these pieces of advice. And Allah knows all intentions. [1]  Have  sincerity  towards  Allah,  for  it  will lead  to  salvation  in  the  worldly  life  and  the Hereafter. Allah\u2019s Messenger (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) said, \u201cAllah has guaranteed the one who  performs  jih\u0101d  for  His  cause,  having  left his home for no reason other than to perform jih\u0101d for His cause and to affirm the truth of His words, that He would enter him into Jannah or return him back home with all the rewards he has attained or the ghan\u012bmah he has acquired.\u201d\nLet  the  goal  of  your  deed  be  that  the  word of  Allah  becomes  the  highest,  for  Ab\u016b  M\u016bsa said,  \u201cAllah\u2019s  Messenger  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa sallam) was asked about a man who fights out of bravery, out of zeal, or out of riy\u0101\u2019 (showing off), which of these is fighting for Allah\u2019s cause? So  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa sallam) said, \u2018Whoever fights so that the word of  Allah  is  the  highest  is  fighting  for  Allah\u2019s cause.\u2019\u201d [2] Be just and sincere towards your subjects, for  \u201cNo  man  is  appointed  to  lead  ten  people except that he will be brought forth in shackles on the Day of Judgment, and will either be set free on account of his justice or destroyed as a result of his oppression.\u201d Likewise, \u201cAny leader who takes charge of the affairs of the Muslims and  then  doesn\u2019t  strive  for  them  and  advise them,  will  not  enter  Jannah  with  them.\u201d  And likewise, \u201cAllah does not give one of His slaves leadership,  who  then  dies  having  cheated  his subjects,  except  that  Allah  will  make  Jannah prohibited for him.\u201d\n10 ARTICLE10 ARTICLE\n[3] Seek consultation and hold discussions, for discussion is the partner of consultation. One should sit in a gathering to exchange ideas, then each  person  comments  on  the  opinions  put forth by the others, or puts forth a new opinion, and  at  the  end  of  the  gathering  the  correct opinion  will  become  clear.  Allah  (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101)  said, {And consult them concerning the matter} [\u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 159]. Allah has directed His Prophet to consult those under him despite the Prophet\u2019s prudent intellect. So what about you?\nAnd  as  was  reported,  \u201cOne  who  seeks consultation will have no regret, and one who prays  istikh\u0101rah  will  not  go  wrong.\u201d  And  it\u2019s been  said,  \u201cHe  who  relies  exclusively  on  his intellect will go astray, and he who is content with his own opinion will slip up, and he who consults  intelligent  men  will  take  the  correct path, and he who seeks the help of a man with insight will attain what is hoped for.\u201d\nSo  let  every  leader  have  a  true  consultative council beginning with the general leader and ending with the detachment commanders. But do not consult a person who has a certain need that he is seeking to fulfill, nor a person whom you sense desires to be consulted, nor a person who doesn\u2019t think his opinions through, for it\u2019s been said, \u201cLeave your opinion until it ripens.\u201d It was reported that \u2018Al\u012b said, \u201cThe opinion of an elder is better than the view of a young man,\u201d meaning  with  regards  to  battle.  And  don\u2019t consult  anyone  unless  he\u2019s  alone,  meaning that you should consult him in private, for this ensures more secrecy and is a greater deterrent to  anyone  who  might  otherwise  disclose  the issue.\nIt is true! \u201cConsultation and discussion are two doors to mercy, and two keys to blessings. No opinion  that\u2019s  been  reached  with  the  help  of these two things will go wrong.\u201d\n[4]  Beware  of  only  consulting  a  person  who always  agrees  with  your  opinion,  and  beware of  bad  company.

Then they surprised  everyone.  Instead of  raising  their  flags  and  imposing Islamic law, they passed control to a civilian council and gave it a budget to pay salaries, import fuel and hire teams  to  clean  up  garbage.

I  said  to  him, \u201cWhy were you invited to this meeting?\u201d He said, \u201cFor the issue to be proposed and discussed with me, because I am one of the sides in the arena and close to the Islamic State.\u201d I said to him, \u201cWhat was your response?\u201d He said, \u201cI told them I would cover the fronts against the regime.\u201d I said, \u201cThen that is your role!\u201d He said to me, \u201cHow can you say I have a role to play?\u201d So I said to him, \u201cYou are going to cover  some  of  the  battlefronts  that  these  factions now hold in order for them to withdraw and then gather in larger numbers against the Islamic State.\u201d This  is  really  what  happened  afterwards  and  that was approximately 10 days after this meeting with Jawl\u0101n\u012b on 3 January 2014.1\nIn  fact,  I  even  heard  Ahmad  Zakk\u016br,  one  of  the leaders  of  \u201cJabhat  an-Nusrah,\u201d  calling  Jawl\u0101n\u012b  on the  walkie-talkie  when  he  had  disappeared  from sight  after  the  fighting  between  the  Islamic  State and  the  factions  including  the  Free  Syrian  Army had begun. Zakk\u016br said to him, \u201cWe have to help our brothers from the factions present in the arena and  stop  the  oppression  of  the  Islamic  State  and fight against it.\u201d\nThis is in addition to other events I myself witnessed. When  for  example,  some  of  the  leadership  of \u201cJabhat  an-Nusrah\u201d  supported  the  Free  Syrian Army with weapons and helped them in fighting against  the  Islamic  State  in  some  regions,  as  was the case of Hammawdah and Ab\u016b Dharr at-T\u016bnus\u012b in the western part of Halab. [Hammawdah is the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front\u2019s top leader of that region].\n1 Editor\u2019s Note: Jawl\u0101n\u012b had foreknowledge of the plot and kept it hidden from the Islamic State. Rather he took part in the planning and execution of the plot, a plot which almost destroyed the mission of jih\u0101d in Sh\u0101m and by which the pure blood of the muh\u0101jir\u012bn and ans\u0101r was poured. Then some dare to claim that his front did not partake in the Sahwah!\nThe  same  thing  in  Idlib,  in  that  Ab\u016b  Sulaym\u0101n the  Australian  prevented  the  soldiers  of  \u201cJabhat an-Nusrah\u201d  from  helping  the  Islamic  State  when the Free Syrian Army planned to attack the State\u2019s training  camp  there  while  it  was  possible  for them to help the Islamic State. So I sent for Ab\u016b Sulaym\u0101n the Australian and said to him, \u201cYou are able to place detachments to prevent the Free Syrian Army\u2019s advance towards the training camp.\u201d I was surprised the next day that the Free Syrian Army had entered the training camp after surrounding it and cutting off reinforcement lines, and had fought the  soldiers  of  the  Islamic  State  inside.  This  was the  beginning  of  my  suspicion  that  there  was  an internal  plot  between  the  Free  Syrian  Army  and \u201cJabhat an-Nusrah.\u201d\nD\u0101biq: When did you decide to distance yourself from the events that were occurring?\nAb\u016b Sam\u012br: After my examination and following of the events, I felt that there was a plot being carried out against the Islamic State with the participation of \u201cJabhat an-Nusrah.\u201d So I decided to keep myself distant  and  move  to  the  south.  On  my  way,  I gathered much evidence for this conclusion. From it is that I met Ab\u016b \u2018Abb\u0101s ad-Dar\u012br, who was the leader of \u201cJabhat an-Nusrah\u201d for the region of arRaqqah. I met him in the area of Alb\u016bkam\u0101l and asked  him  about  the  reason  for  his  fighting  the Islamic State in ar-Raqqah. He mentioned to me the whole story of how he and Ahr\u0101r ash-Sh\u0101m had agreed with many of the battalions including those of Ab\u016b \u2018\u012as\u0101 ar-Raqqah (Liw\u0101\u2019 Thuww\u0101r ar-Raqqah) \nAb\u016b Sulaym\u0101n the Australian,an ally of the FSA\ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "IN THE WORDS OF THE ENEMY", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "66"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq12-HIKMAH", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "12", "schema:articleBody": "Jam\u0101\u2019ahOr J\u0101hiliyyah\nAllah\u2019s Messenger g said, \u201cWhoever sees something from his leader that he dislikes, then he should be patient with him, for whoever parts from the Jam\u0101\u2019ah a handspan and dies, dies a death of  j\u0101hiliyyah\u201d [Reported by alBukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim from Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s].\nAllah\u2019s  Messenger  g  said,  \u201cWhoever  leaves  obedience,  parts  from  the Jam\u0101\u2019ah, and dies, dies a death of  j\u0101hiliyyah\u201d [Reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim from Ab\u016b Hurayrah].\nAllah\u2019s Messenger g said, \u201cWhoever withdraws his hand from obedience will meet Allah on Resurrection Day without having any excuse.

These operations are merely a selection of the numerous operations that the Islamic State has conducted on various fronts across many regions over the course of the last two months.\nWil\u0101yat  al-Khayr  -  On  Wednesday  the  25th  of  DhulQa\u2019dah, the soldiers of the Khil\u0101fah carried out an assault on  the  forward  defense  position  for  the  missile  battalion base  at  the  Dayr  az-Zawr  military  airbase  and  succeeded in taking control of the position. Two istishh\u0101d\u012b operations were  then  carried  out  by  our  brothers  Ab\u016b  Ayman  ashSh\u0101m\u012b and Abul-Khans\u0101\u2019 al-Hims\u012b using a tank and a BMP rigged with explosives. They targeted two groups of Nusayr\u012b soldiers inside the battalion base, and their attacks were followed by an assault in which the muj\u0101hid\u012bn succeeded in taking complete control of the base and capturing a large quantity  of  ghan\u012bmah.  One  month  later,  the  muj\u0101hid\u012bn would score another major victory in their ongoing efforts to capture the Dayr az-Zawr airbase. In a string of blessed operations, the soldiers of the Khil\u0101fah, by Allah\u2019s grace, succeeded in capturing a number of strategic points in the \nAchieved  shahadah  during the operation that led to the capture of the missile battalion base in al-Khayr\nA Nusayr\u012b soldier shortly before he\u2019s killed\n25\nA SELECTION OF MILITARY OPERATIONS\nvicinity  of  the  airbase,  including  the  Abul-Wal\u012bd  farms, Buy\u016bt ad-Dughaym, Dashmat Hamad, and the Zan\u016bbiy\u0101 factory next to the entrance to the airbase. This occurred after several days of continuous clashes during the course of which several istishh\u0101d\u012b operations were carried out. The soldiers of the Khil\u0101fah continue to besiege the airbase, anticipating its pending liberation, bi idhnill\u0101h.\nWil\u0101yat al-Barakah - On Wednesday the 1st of Dhul-Hijjah, our brother Ab\u016b \u2018Amr al-Barakah succeeded in breaching PKK security checkpoints in the city of al-Barakah and attacked the murtadd\u012bn\u2019s public relations headquarters located on the outskirts of the Mushayrifah neighborhood. He detonated his explosive vehicle, destroying the headquarters,  killing  nearly  30  murtadd\u012bn,  and  wounding  several others. May Allah accept him amongst the shuhad\u0101\u2019.\nBengal - On Monday the 14th of Dhul-Hijjah, a security cell comprised of the Khil\u0101fah\u2019s soldiers in Bangladesh targeted and killed the Italian crusader Cesare Tavella, following him on one of the streets of the city of Dhaka and shooting him with a silencer. Just five days later, they struck again, targeting Kunio Hoshi, a citizen of Japan, one of the member nations  of  the  crusader  coalition.  He  was  closely  tracked and eliminated in the city of Rangpur using a firearm. Just three weeks later, on the 10th of Muharram, the muj\u0101hid\u012bn detonated a number of IEDs on the D\u0101l\u0101n temple in the city of Dhaka as the R\u0101fidah were conducting their shirk\u012b rituals, killing and wounding nearly 100 of them. Eleven days later, the muj\u0101hid\u012bn assaulted a checkpoint in Dhaka, killing one policeman and wounding another.\nWil\u0101yat  \u2018Adan  Abyan  -  On  Tuesday  the  22nd  of  DhulHijjah,  four  istishh\u0101d\u012b  operations  targeted  a  gathering  of Saudi, Emirati, and Yemeni officers and pounded the Yemeni government\u2019s headquarters. The first was carried out by our brother Ab\u016b Sa\u2019d al-\u2018Adan\u012b, who detonated his explosive truck at the Palace Hotel, which served as the government\u2019s headquarters.  He  was  followed  by  the  second  istishh\u0101d\u012b, Ab\u016b  Muhammad  as-Sahl\u012b,  who  detonated  his  explosive Hummer at the same location, killing the murtadd soldiers present there. The third istishh\u0101d\u012b attack was carried out by our brother Aws al-\u2018Adan\u012b targeting the Saudi and Emirati forces\u2019 central operations base.

Shaykh \u2018Abdul-Kar\u012bm al-Humayd (may Allah keep him  firm  and  release  him  from  imprisonment) wrote  an  excellent  treatise  titled  \u201cAl-Mash\u0101yikh al-Judud  wa  Da\u2019watuhum  ilal  Mub\u0101halah\u201d  (The New Mash\u0101yikh and Calling Them to Mub\u0101halah) in which he clarified the proofs for the matter and called the so-called \u201cCommittee of Elder Scholars\u201d as well as Salm\u0101n al-\u2018Awdah and N\u0101sir al-\u2018Umar to a mub\u0101halah, after they repeatedly labelled the muj\u0101hid\u012bn \u201ckhaw\u0101rij\u201d and invited the Palestinians to participate in the shirk\u012b religion of democracy by voting for Hamas! The following discussion on mub\u0101halah is mostly taken from his treatise.\nThe main proof for the legality of mub\u0101halah is the verses: {Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created Him from dust; then He said to him, \u201cBe,\u201d and he was. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters. Then whoever argues with you about it after knowledge has come to you \u2013 say, \u201cCome, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women,  ourselves  and  yourselves,  then  supplicate earnestly and invoke the curse of Allah upon the liars\u201d} [\u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 59-61].\nThese  verses  were  revealed  with  regards  to  a christian  delegation  from  Najr\u0101n  that  came  to the Prophet (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) and debated him on Islam. When mub\u0101halah was proposed, the christian delegation backed out.\nAllah \u2018azza wa jall also said, {Say, \u201cWhoever is in error \u2013 let ar-Rahm\u0101n lengthen for him an extension [in time] until, when they see that which they were promised \u2013 either punishment or the Hour.\u201d They will come to know who is worst in position \nand weaker in soldiers\u201d} [Maryam: 75].\nIbn  Kath\u012br  (rahimahull\u0101h)  said  \u2013  commenting  on the verse, \u201cAllah ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101 says, {Say}, O Muhammad to these mushrik\u012bn who associate others with their Lord, who claim that they are upon the  truth and that you are upon falsehood. \n{Whoever is in error}, meaning from amongst us and amongst you. {Let ar-Rahm\u0101n lengthen for him an extension} meaning, that Allah leaves him in his condition,  until  he  meets  his  Lord  and  his  term elapses.  {Either  punishment}  afflicts  him,  {or  the Hour} comes to him suddenly. {They will come to know} then, {who is worst in position and weaker in soldiers}, meaning in contrast to their claim of good position and assembly.\u201d\n\u201cMuj\u0101hid said regarding His words: {Let ar-Rahm\u0101n lengthen  for  him  an  extension},  \u2018Let  Allah  leave him in his tyranny.\u2019 This is what Abu Ja\u2019far Ibn Jar\u012br at-Tabar\u012b (rahimahull\u0101h) ascertained.\u201d\n\u201cThis  is  the  mub\u0101halah  for  the  mushrik\u012bn  who claim  that  they  are  upon  guidance  with  regards to  their  religion,  as  Allah  ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101  also  mentioned the mub\u0101halah for the jews in His words,  {Say, \u201cO you who are jews, if you claim that you are allies of Allah, excluding the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful\u201d} [Al-Jumu\u2019ah: 6], meaning supplicate for death to befall the one upon falsehood amongst us or amongst you; if you claim that you are upon truth, then du\u2019\u0101\u2019 cannot harm you.

The word nuzz\u0101\u2019 is the plural of naz\u012b\u2019 and n\u0101zi\u2019, which refers to a stranger who breaks off from his family and tribe [meaning  he  departs  and  distances  himself  from  them], and the naz\u0101\u2019i\u2019 of the camels are the outsiders. AlHaraw\u012b (rahimahull\u0101h) said, \u2018By this he [the Prophet] is referring to the muh\u0101jir\u012bn who\u2019ve abandoned their homelands and migrated to Allah ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101\u2019\u201d [al-Q\u0101bid\u016bna \u2018alal-Jamr].\n\f", "schema:headline": "Foreword ", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq14-Kill-the-Im\u0101ms-of-Kufr-in-the-West", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "14", "schema:articleBody": "The Ruling on Riddah\nThe ruling of the person who commits riddah is \nthat he is killed, unless he repents before he is apprehended. Allah\u2019s Messenger g sent Mu\u2019\u0101dh Ibn Jabal h to Yemen to assist Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 al-Ash\u2019ar\u012b h with ruling the people according to the Shar\u012b\u2019ah. When he arrived at the court assembly, he found there a man bound in chains. He asked Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101, \u201cWho is this?\u201d He replied, \u201cHe was a Jew who accepted Islam and then became a Jew again. Sit.\u201d Mu\u2019\u0101dh said, \u201cI will not sit until he is killed. Such is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger! Such is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger! Such is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger!\u201d So Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 gave the order and he was killed [Reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim]. His repeated statement, that \u201csuch is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger,\u201d is a clear evidence that the ruling of one who leaves Islam after he is apprehended is that he is killed.\nAs for repenting before being caught, then Allah said, {Say, \u201cO My slaves, those who have transgressed against  themselves,  do  not  despair  of  the  mercy  of Allah. Verily, Allah forgives all sins. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. And repent to your Lord and surrender to Him before the punishment reaches you; then  you  will  not  be  helped\u201d}  [Az-Zumar:  53-54]. Likewise,  and  specifically  about  the  apostate,  Allah \nThe punishment for apostasy\nsaid, {How would Allah guide a people who disbelieved  after  they  believed,  having  testified  that  the Messenger is true, and clear evidences reached them, and  Allah  does  not  guide  tyrannical  people.  Those, their reward is that the curse of Allah, the angels, and all of mankind is upon them, abiding therein forever. The torment does not lessen for them, nor are they given respite, except those who repent thereafter and correct themselves, for verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful} [\u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 87-89]. It should then be no surprise  that  Am\u012brul-Mu\u2019min\u012bn  Ab\u016b  Bakr  al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (hafidhahull\u0101h)  declared  that  any  of  the  apostates from the sahw\u0101t or otherwise who repent to Allah and surrender themselves to the Islamic State will be guaranteed amnesty, even if they had killed a million muj\u0101hid\u012bn. But those who are caught before they repent, then there is no amnesty for them and theirs shall be a painful \u2013 and fatal \u2013 punishment.\nHistorical Examples\nDuring  the  life  and  mission  of  the  Prophet  g, \nthe issue of riddah arose on a few occasions. The most famous case was that of the \u2018Ukl\u012b\u2013\u2018Uran\u012b apostates. Some men from the tribes of \u2018Ukl and \u2018Uraynah came to al-Mad\u012bnah, entered upon the Prophet g, and announced their Islam. They then said to him, \u201cO  Prophet  of  Allah! We  are  a  people  of  livestock, \n\fthe pro-democracy \u201cIslamist\u201d parties who refer legislation to several dozen or  several  hundred  elected  officials (\u201clegislators\u201d) and between the pagan Hindus who direct worship to countless idols. Yet, out of Allah\u2019s mercy, He did  not  impose  upon  our  Ummah such a difficult act of atonement for shirk  as  He  did  for  Ban\u012b  Isr\u0101\u2019\u012bl,  but instead only requires that those who fall into shirk abandon the act of shirk they committed and repent sincerely.Furthermore, by stating that only a  few  of  the  hypocrites  would  obey Him if He were to command them to kill themselves or to perform hijrah, Allah  is  exposing  the  nature  of  the hypocrites who merely pay lip service to the religion without actually having obedience to their Lord. As such, if  they  were  to  be  faced  with  commands that entail a tremendous level of difficulty and sacrifice, they would make  excuses  for  themselves  rather than follow the clear revelation. This reinforces the point that the true slave of Allah is one who neither questions the  wisdom  in  His  commands  nor hesitates to carry them out, regardless of how difficult they may appear. It\u2019s important to note that many of those who  claim  to  follow  Allah  and  His Messenger find it difficult to perform deeds \u2013 whether hijrah or otherwise \u2013  purely  out  of  obedience  to  Allah and His Messenger. They claim that they must know the wisdom related to the deed \u2013 and undoubtedly there is wisdom in all Allah\u2019s decrees \u2013 but if they can\u2019t see it, or if they believe that  this  wisdom  no  longer  applies to the modern era or to their society, they neglect the deed, discourage and mock those who perform it, and even wage  war  against  the  Book  of  Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, all the while still claiming to be Muslims!Those who do this are of varying levels. There are those who are more blatant  in  this  regard  and  have  no shame in declaring that the Shar\u012b\u2019ah is  \u201cbarbaric,\u201d  or  is  inapplicable  in our  times,  and  there  are  those  who are  more  discreet,  including  many \nwho reside in the lands of kufr, refuse to perform hijrah, and make all manner of excuses in order to avoid such a lofty obligation. This, however,  is  not  surprising  when one considers that the sacrifice and difficulty entailed in making hijrah is so great that Allah c mentioned it  in  the  above  \u0101yah  alongside the order to kill oneself! Even the Prophets p were not exempt from the  difficulty  involved  in  making hijrah, including the best of mankind g, who made hijrah to a city whose  population  included  some treacherous  Jews  and  hypocrites and  was  surrounded  by  hostile Bedouin  tribes  after  first  leaving the protection of his own tribe and relatives, facing an assassination attempt, and seeking shelter in a cave for a number of days. Performing hijrah is often a serious test of one\u2019s \u012bm\u0101n and tawakkul, and as such, it requires a believer to prepare himself by ensuring that he is ready to carry out the commands of Allah with nothing more than a simple order,  even  if  he  doesn\u2019t  understand  the  whole  wisdom  behind it. Allah c says, {But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not} [Al-Baqarah: 216].\nnarration \nAlso,  one  can  take  from  the aforementioned of Th\u0101bit  Ibn  Qays  that  a  believer must  demonstrate  confidence  in his  willingness  to  obey  Allah  and His  Messenger  in  the  most  difficult  of  circumstances  and  not second-guess  himself,  even  when facing  a  hypothetical  scenario. Doing so does not constitute tazkiyat (self-promotion) when accompanied with a correct intention, such as for the purpose of  displaying  honor  and  strength in front of the kuff\u0101r, as was done by Th\u0101bit h in front of the Jew, or for the purpose of inciting oneself towards the obedience of Allah \nan-nafs \nand His Messenger, and this is of even greater significance, for in the aforementioned \u0101y\u0101t, Allah c says, {And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger \u2013 those will be with the ones  upon  whom  Allah  has  bestowed favor} [An-Nis\u0101\u2019: 69], and in  the  \u0101y\u0101t  preceding  this,  Allah c says, {And We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by permission  of  Allah}  [An-Nis\u0101\u2019: 64]. So the believer must be conscious of his level of obedience to Allah and His Messenger, and incite  himself  in  that  regard.\nConcerning  the  words  of  Allah,  {But  if  they  had  done  what they were instructed, it would have been better for them and a firmer position [for them in faith]} [AnNis\u0101\u2019: 66], at-Tabar\u012b mentions that as-Sudd\u012b  explained  \u201ca  firmer  position\u201d to mean \u201ca stronger tasd\u012bq (affirmation  of  the  truth).\u201d  This is appropriate, for indeed one can affirm the truth of Islam with his words, but if this is not backed by lofty deeds such as hijrah then it is often  merely  lip  service,  as  mentioned earlier concerning the hypocrites. As such, Allah is teaching us  that  by  performing  the  deeds we\u2019ve been instructed to do \u2013 particularly the difficult ones that require  a  greater  level  of  obedience and  sacrifice  \u2013  the  Muslim  lends more strength to his claim that he is a believer. As a result, Allah c grants him two tremendous favors, as  mentioned  in  the  two  subsequent \u0101y\u0101t: {And then We would have given them from Us a great reward. And We would have guided  them  to  a  straight  path}  [AnNis\u0101\u2019:  67-68].\nMay  Allah  make  us \nfrom among those who do not shy away from  performing  difficult  deeds that  bring  us  guidance  and  adherence to the straight path in the Duny\u0101  followed  by  tremendous rewards  in  the  Hereafter.\n191\f", "schema:headline": "Kill the Im\u0101ms of Kufr in the West", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "8"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq10-FROM-THE-PAGES-OF-HISTORY", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "The  Expeditions  the  Prophet  Dispatched  in Ramad\u0101n\nThe  definition  of  a  ghazwah  is  a  battle  in  which the Prophet \uf067 went out with his companions and himself led the battle. A sariyyah on the other hand is one he was not present in and did not lead. The total  number  of  sar\u0101y\u0101  he  dispatched  was  73,  11 of which were sent out in the month of Ramad\u0101n. These 11 are the following:\n1) The Sariyyah of S\u0101hil al-Bahr: This occurred in the Ramad\u0101n of the first year after the Hijrah. It was  the  first  expedition  dispatched  in  Islam.  The Prophet  \uf067  appointed  Hamzah  \uf068  as  its  leader and  sent  him  with  30  men  from  the  Muh\u0101jir\u012bn. They went out to face a trade caravan belonging to Quraysh that had come from Sh\u0101m. They reached S\u012bf Al-Bahr, an area on the coast of the Red Sea, facing  the  kuffar  and  preparing  rows  for  battle. Majd\u012b Ibn \u2018Amr al-Juhan\u012b who was an ally of both sides, came between the two sides and as a result they did not fight.\n2) The Sariyyah of \u2018Umayr Ibn \u2018Ad\u012b al-Khitm\u012b: This occurred in the Ramad\u0101n of the second year after the Hijrah. The Prophet \uf067 dispatched this expedition to  kill  \u2018Asm\u0101\u2019  Bint  Marw\u0101n,  a  woman  who  used to insult Islam and incite against the Prophet \uf067. \u2018Umayr Ibn \u2018Ad\u012by al-Khitm\u012b came to her house at night and placed his sword on her chest, applying pressure until he had carried it through to her back.\n3)  The  Sariyyah  of  Zayd  Ibn  H\u0101rithah:  In  the Ramad\u0101n  of  the  sixth  year  after  the  Hijrah,  the Prophet  \uf067  dispatched  an  expedition  for  Ban\u016b Faz\u0101rah in a region of al-Qur\u0101 Valley. The reason was that men from Ban\u016b Faz\u0101rah had intercepted a trade caravan belonging to the Muslims and looted it. Zayd Ibn H\u0101rithah left for them while heading a troop of the Prophet\u2019s companions. They reached them in the morning and surrounded them and took Umm Qirfah F\u0101timah Bint Rab\u012b\u2019ah al-Faz\u0101riyyah. She  was  an  old  woman  venerated  and  obeyed  by her people. She had prepared 40 cavaliers from her sons and her son\u2019s sons to kill the Prophet \uf067. The noble companion Zayd Ibn H\u0101rithah killed them all including Umm Qirfah.\n4) The Sariyyah of \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn \u2018At\u012bk: This occurred in the Ramad\u0101n of the sixth year after the Hijrah. The tribes of al-\u2018Aws and Khazraj used to compete in  their  defense  of  the  Prophet  \uf067.  So  when  the \u2018Aws killed Ka\u2019b Ibn al-Ashraf, who used to cause the  Prophet  \uf067  harm,  the  Khazraj  searched  for someone who was similar to him in opposition to the Messenger of Allah \uf067 . They found their target in Ab\u016b R\u0101fi\u2019 Sal\u0101m Ibn Ab\u012b Haq\u012bq an-Nadr\u012b. He was the one who gathered the parties on the day of the Khandaq (Trench) and prepared the Ghataf\u0101n tribe to fight the Messenger of Allah \uf067. He would also disparage Allah\u2019s Messenger \uf067 in the various gatherings. The Khazraj from the Sah\u0101bah sought permission from the Prophet \uf067 to kill Ab\u016b R\u0101fi\u2019. He gave them permission so they sent five of their members  with  \u2018Abdullah  Ibn  \u2018At\u012bk  leading  them. The sariyyah raided the house of Ab\u016b R\u0101fi\u2019, killed him, and returned.\n5) The Sariyyah of Gh\u0101lib al-Layth\u012b: In the Ramad\u0101n of the seventh year after the Hijrah, the Prophet \uf067 sent this detachment to Ban\u016b \u2018Uw\u0101l and to Ban\u016b \u2018Abd Ibn Tha\u2019labah, two tribes from the Bedouins of Najd. The men of the two tribes used to conduct raids  on  the  outskirts  of  al-Mad\u012bnah  whilst  the Muslims  were  pre-occupied  with  their  battles against Quraysh and the Jews. Under the leadership of Gh\u0101lib al-Layth\u012b, 130 fighters from the Muslims marched towards them. They attacked them at the time of Fajr and killed everyone who stood against them.  The  remaining  fled.  They  seized  livestock and sheep from them which they took back to alMad\u012bnah.\n6)  The  Sariyyah  of  Ab\u016b  Qat\u0101dah  as-Salam\u012b:  This occurred in the Ramad\u0101n of the eighth year after the Hijrah. This was at the time that the Prophet \uf067 contemplated attacking Makkah. He sent Ab\u016b Qat\u0101dah  as-Salam\u012b  with  8  others  to  Batn  Idam (a valley north of Makkah). This was in order to trick Quraysh with regards to the true goal of the Muslims, and make them think that the Muslims were  targeting  that  area  and  not  Makkah.  The sariyyah reached the target without facing anything and so departed, joining up with the Muslim army.\n7)  The  Sariyyah  of  Kh\u0101lid  Ibn  al-Wal\u012bd:  This \ndabiq\n\fFSA  secularists  join  hands  with  the  atheist PKK to fight the Islamic State\nThe  next  few  months  would  see  the  crusaders focusing  three  quarters  of  the  airstrikes  in  Iraq and  Sh\u0101m  on  the  city  of  \u2018Ayn  al-Isl\u0101m  alone in  an  attempt  to  dislodge  the  muj\u0101hid\u012bn  \u2013  all this  in  support  of  the  \u201cfearsome\u201d  PKK  fighters. Despite  the  obvious  incompetence  of  the  PKK in facing the Islamic State, the crusader coalition continued  to  provide  them  with  close  air  cover in their clashes against the muj\u0101hid\u012bn. The PKK would claim that they were advancing against the Islamic State, when the reality was that they and their FSA allies would simply move into any given area after the crusaders had already bombed the Islamic State positions there, leaving the area up for grabs. The PKK and their allies weren\u2019t fighting for territory, they were simply hiding and waiting it out, letting the crusaders do the work and then walking in and reaping the \u201cfruits\u201d when it was all over. These cowardly tactics are the reason that they and their FSA allies \u2013 Jam\u0101l Ma\u2019r\u016bf4, Ab\u016b \u2018\u012as\u0101 ar-Raqqah5,  and  \u2018Abdul-Jabb\u0101r  al-\u2018Ak\u012bd\u012b6  \u2013  were recently  able  to  advance  on  the  towns  of  Sul\u016bk and Tall Abyad in Wil\u0101yat ar-Raqqah.7 4 An FSA leader and former ally of the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front.5 The former leader of the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front in ar-Raqqah up until three months into the Sahwah. He was disowned by the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front because they were supposedly no longer able to make contact with him \u2013 not because of his kufr \u2013 and yet everyday they claim to make contact with Dhaw\u0101hir\u012b\u2019s al-Q\u0101\u2019idah all the way in Khur\u0101s\u0101n!6 A former leader in the so-called \u201cLiw\u0101\u2019 at-Tawhid.\u201d7 PKK advances have been coupled with ethnic cleansing carried out against Arabs and Turkmen for the sake of establishing a purely Kurdish \u201cAmerican Kurdistan.\u201d The secularist Kurds\u2019 hatred of Arabs in particular leads them to hate Islam by extension and even sympathize with the Jews and their Jewish state! Despite this fact, the statement released by the Sahw\u0101t condemning the PKK does not make takfir of them, nor does it denounce\uf067 \nCrusader airstrikes on \u2018Ayn al-Islam turned the city into rubble\nYet  being  the  incompetent  proxies  that  they are,  the  PKK  \u2013  shortly  afterwards  \u2013  found themselves flanked by Islamic State soldiers who infiltrated  their  territory  and  entered  \u2018Ayn  alIsl\u0101m once more, with further gains being made by the muj\u0101hid\u012bn thereafter in the southern and western  countryside.  This  is  in  addition  to  the Khil\u0101fah\u2019s offensive in Wil\u0101yat al-Barakah where the muj\u0101hid\u012bn advanced on the city of al-Barakah \n\uf067their hatred of Islam and the Shar\u012b\u2019ah.

He  massacred  thousands  upon  thousands and burned all the books of Ahlus-Sunnah, not even sparing  their  copies  of  the  Qur\u2019\u0101n.  Originally  hosting  an overwhelming  Sunni-majority  population,  Persia,  eastern Iraq, and Khur\u0101s\u0101n were once bustling with knowledge conveyed by the likes of linguists S\u012bbawayh and al-Azhar\u012b; had\u012bth masters al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim; mufassir\u012bn at-Tabar\u012b and alBaghaw\u012b;  and  fuqah\u0101\u2019  al-Marwaz\u012b  and  Ibnul-Mundhir.  But once controlled by the Safawiyyah, these lands became virtually void of scholarship.\nAn  age  of  darkness  quickly  spread  over  the  once  enlightened Persia. Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl and his descendants worked to forcefully convert the Sunni majority to the R\u0101fid\u012b religion. The same took place in other Sunni majority lands, including Azerbaijan. Arab R\u0101fid\u012b \u201cscholars\u201d from Lebanon, Bahrain, and Iraq were imported to teach their deviant tenets. The most famous of them \u2013 and one of the first to arrive \u2013 was \u2018Al\u012b Ibn al-Husayn al-Karak\u012b (died 940AH), who was given the position of \u201cShaykhul-Isl\u0101m\u201d and put in charge of an official agency established to oversee the conversion of Ahlus-Sunnah. It was alKarak\u012b who issued the fat\u0101w\u0101 allowing Ithn\u0101-\u2018Ashr\u012b R\u0101fidah to use military force to establish their rule, thus \u201csubstantiating\u201d Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl\u2019s claims and justifying all of his abuses.

Im\u0101ms were ordered to curse Ab\u016b Bakr as-Sidd\u012bq, \u2018Umar Ibn al-Khatt\u0101b, and \u2018Uthm\u0101n Ibn \u2018Aff\u0101n \uf06a during every Jumu\u2019ah sermon.\n1   These were Turkic militias organized by Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl\u2019s father and known as the Qizilb\u0101sh (Turkish for \u201cRedheads\u201d) because of their crimson crowns of twelve gores each, representing their allegiance to the Twelver sect.\nSunni  graveyards  were  desecrated  and  their  mas\u0101jid  destroyed. Tom\u00e9 Pires, a crusader and Portuguese ambassador to China, who traveled through Persia during 916 and 917AH, witnessed this, saying, \u201cHe [Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl] renovates our churches yet destroys the mas\u0101jid of Muslims who follow the Sunnah\u201d [Summa  Oriental].\nIn imitation of Ibn Buwayh, a R\u0101fid\u012b leader of the fourth century, Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl revived public observance of al-Husayn\u2019s death, the rituals of which were described by Ibn Kath\u012br, who said, \u201cOrders were given [by Ibn Buwayh] for the markets to close, for women to wear hair-woven sackcloths, and to go out with their faces and hair uncovered, as they slapped their faces and wailed  for  al-Husayn  Ibn  \u2018Al\u012b  Ibn  Ab\u012b  T\u0101lib.  Ahlus-Sunnah were unable to prevent this due to the number of Sh\u012b\u2019ah and their dominance, as the ruler was on the side of the Sh\u012b\u2019ah\u201d [Al-Bid\u0101yah  wan-Nih\u0101yah].\nFestivities marking the assassination of \u2018Umar Ibn al-Khatt\u0101b r were also established during this time. This practice was supported  by  Muhammad  B\u0101qir  al-Majlis\u012b  (died  1111AH), regarded as one of the most important Safaw\u012b palace \u201cscholars\u201d also given the title \u201cShaykhul-Isl\u0101m\u201d by the \u201csh\u0101h.\u201d On celebrating  \u2018Umar\u2019s  death,  he  said,  \u201cWhat  is  known  among Sh\u012b\u2019ah in the major cities and lands of our present time is that it [the assassination of \u2018Umar] was on the 9th of Rab\u012b\u2019 al-Awwal, and it is a day of celebration\u201d [Bih\u0101r al-Anw\u0101r]. He then mentioned a fabricated report as evidence that this was the day of \u2018Umar\u2019s death (which was actually on the 26th of DhulHijjah) and that it is to be considered the greatest \u2018\u012bd for the supporters  of  Ahlul-Bayt!\nLike  present-day  R\u0101fidah,  the  Safawiyyah  were  known  for their allegiance to crusaders. Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl \u2013 then in control of Hormuz \u2013 allied with the crusader Portuguese between 921 and 927AH  to  assist  them  in  their  conquest  of  al-Bahrayn  and al-Qat\u012bf in the eastern Arabian Peninsula, directly defying one of the Prophet\u2019s final command\u2019s to expel the mushrik\u012bn from \nA  R\u0101fid\u012b  shrine  in  Iran  dedicated  to  Ab\u016b Lu\u2018lu\u2018ah  al-Maj\u016bs\u012b,  the  killer  of \u2018Umar  h\n\fBengal \u2013 On the 7th of Safar, Islamic State security units carried out an operation in the vicinity of Dinajpur where the Italian crusader named Piero Parolari, who was working as a missionary in the area, was shot several times using a silenced pistol, leaving him critically wounded. This followed an operation conducted two weeks earlier on the 25th of Muharram that targeted one of the heads of kufr from the Bah\u0101\u2019\u012b sect in Dhaka known as R\u016bhul-Am\u012bn who works as the director of the Bah\u0101\u2019\u012b center in the region of Rangpur. He was targeted with silenced pistols, leaving him critically wounded. Also in Rangpur, in the vicinity of K\u016bny\u0101, the murtadd Rahmat \u2018Al\u012b, a leading member of the ruling Awami League, was returning home on the 27th of Muharram when he was successfully apprehended and killed. In addition to targeting individuals, the soldiers of the Khil\u0101fah in Bengal have also carried out attacks on the murtadd\u012bn\u2019s temples of shirk. On the 14th of Safar, they targeted a R\u0101fid\u012b temple funded and overseen by the Iranian embassy. The attack took place in Bogra District and resulted in a number of mushrik\u012bn being killed and injured after being hit by automatic weapons fire. Just one month later, our istishh\u0101d\u012b brother, Abul-Fid\u0101\u2019 al-Bangh\u0101l\u012b, entered into a temple of the Qadiy\u0101n\u012b murtadd\u012bn in the area of Bagmara in Rajshahi District armed with an explosive belt. He detonated his explosive belt in their midst, injuring 30 of them. May Allah accept him among the shuhad\u0101\u2019. Two weeks later, the soldiers of the Khil\u0101fah eliminated the murtadd known as Samir Uddin \u2013 who had become a Christian and was working as a missionary \u2013 by stabbing him with a knife in the district of Jhenaidah.\nWil\u0101yat Hadramawt \u2013 On the 8th of Safar, the soldiers of the Khil\u0101fah launched a major surprise assault on Yemeni barracks west of Hadramawt. The operation began with an assault on the Shub\u0101m, Sirr, and al-Q\u0101rrah barracks on the road between the regions of Say\u2019\u016bn and al-Qutun after first cutting off their supply routes. The muj\u0101hid\u012bn succeeded in capturing the barracks and also targeted support divisions with explosive devices. They also destroyed four military vehicles killing all the soldiers inside, with the Yemeni army then dispatching another force to regain control of the situation. The new force was then targeted by an istishh\u0101d\u012b operation carried out by our brother Batt\u0101r al-\u2018Adan\u012b. He detonated his explosive vehicle in their midst, killing and wounding dozens of them. May Allah accept him among the shuhad\u0101\u2019. Meanwhile, the soldiers of the Khil\u0101fah succeeded in hitting a helicopter after targeting it with heavy machine guns, and the bulk of these operations led to at least 50 murtadd\u012bn being killed.\nTunisia \u2013 On the 12th of Safar, our istishh\u0101d\u012b brother Ab\u016b \u2018Abdill\u0101h at-T\u016bnus\u012b rushed towards a bus carrying members of the presidential guard on Muhammad al-Kh\u0101mis Street in the center of the Tunisian capital.

We  covered  a  number  of different religions, including Islam. In the very first class, the teacher \u2013 who wasn\u2019t even a Muslim \u2013 recited the shahadah in Arabic and then explained to us  that  this  was  the  Islamic  testimony  of  faith. We learned about the five pillars of Islam on a very basic level, but some things were portrayed in a manner that seemed nonsensical to me. For example, we were told that during the fasting month of Ramadan, Muslims don\u2019t eat and drink all day but they stay up all night eating and partying. My next encounter with Islam was when I got married. My husband was brought up in a Muslim family but he wasn\u2019t practicing at all. We had children together but got divorced a few years afterwards. At that point, I really wanted to learn about Islam, and because of the blessed events of September 11th,  I  would  always  see  Islam  mocked  in  the  media,  but  I  was  still  curious  and  wanted  to  find  out more about this religion. At the same time, I had a neighbor who had introduced me to Islam a few years earlier. So she let me borrow a copy of the Quran that was translated into my own language. The translation wasn\u2019t so good, but she was good at explaining, so if I didn\u2019t understand anything she would clarify it for me. What struck me most as I was reading the Quran were the verses about Hellfire and the punishment in the Hereafter.\nNot long afterwards, I knew that this religion really was the truth. I started learning to pray on my own because I thought I had to learn everything before  becoming  Muslim.  I  have  to  admit  though,  I \nwas scared and nervous because I didn\u2019t understand a lot of things. I would think to myself, \u201cHow would my parents react if I were to become a Muslim? How would my colleagues react?\u201d It felt like a big ordeal even though I knew in my heart that I had to do this. So when I was coming back from work one day and I saw my neighbor on the bus, I asked her, \u201cWould you  like  to  teach  me  how  to  pray?\u201d  She  replied  by asking, \u201cDo you want to become a Muslim?\u201d At that moment, I felt myself thinking, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d So I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and both her and her husband began crying. I pronounced the shahadah in their home and they began teaching me how to pray. It was a wonderful feeling.  After  continuously  searching  for  the  truth, finding it was just such a relief. I felt so much peace.I can\u2019t say that things were easy after becoming a Muslim, but it did bring pleasure to my heart nonetheless. Things weren\u2019t easy with my parents. At first, they didn\u2019t react much, but one year later when I remarried, they began having a problem with it. When I started wearing hijab, they would make things difficult.  They  would  argue,  \u201cEven  Muslims  that  were raised Muslim don\u2019t wear it, so why do you?\u201d They were not happy, and it was funny how their Christianity came out more than ever at that point. Before that, they wouldn\u2019t speak about Christianity at all, but suddenly they were mentioning it more frequently, saying things like, \u201cThis is the religion of our forefathers.\u201d All of this was to try to bring me back to their religion. I felt the same with my colleagues, who would ask me why I had made this decision. This was the case because I was the only Muslim they would see regularly.I lived in the capital, and although there were Muslims  there,  it  wasn\u2019t  the  same  as  in  other  European countries;  the  Muslim  community  was  very  small. \n\fThe remnants of aNusayri \n \nplane\n \nThemuahdn\nj\ni\ni\n i\n \nnKhayr \nW\nilayah\nJazair Wilayah \u2013 On the 8th of Rajab,  six  soldiers  of  the  murtadd Algerian  army  were  killed  and  another nine were wounded when the soldiers of the Caliphate detonated an explosive device as the murtaddin passed by on the Mount Wahsh road in the area of Qusantinah. Less than a week later, the soldiers of the Caliphate  detonated  several  explosive  devices  on  Algerian  soldiers as  they  were  sweeping  the  area  of Qurush in Jijel in the northeastern region of Jazair.\nNinawa Wilayah \u2013 On the 9th of  Rajab,  six  American  helicopters backed by two warplanes attempted to carry out a special forces raid at dhuhr in the area of Sabuniyyah on the road between Mosul and Tal\u2019afar.  The  soldiers  of  the  Caliphate succeeded, by Allah\u2019s grace, in foiling the operation after targeting the warplanes  using  antiaircraft  guns, driving  the  Crusaders  away  in  defeat.\nKhayr Wilayah \u2013 On the 11th of Rajab, the soldiers of the Caliphate,  by  Allah\u2019s  grace,  succeeded  in completely  capturing  the  remaining Nusayri positions in the industrial  neighborhood  in  the  city  of Khayr after attacking it from several points using various types of weapons. They killed several murtaddin, with the rest fleeing in terror, and \nthe battle moved to the outskirts of the  neighborhood  of  Tahtuh.  The mujahidin  likewise  captured  several  weapons  and  various  types  of ammo as ghanimah. Less than two weeks later, they launched a surprise attack on Nusayri locations and fortifications  separating  between  the industrial  neighborhood  and  the neighborhood of Tahtuh. This came after one of the mujahidin created openings in the Nusayri line of defense using a bulldozer, paving the way  for  Islamic  State  infantrymen to stealthily advance and carry out a  surprise  attack.  They  succeeded in  capturing  several  points  where the murtaddin were entrenched after they fled in defeat. During the course of the same week, they carried out attacks on several Nusayri army locations in the neighborhood of Tahtuh and succeeded in capturing  them.\nBengal \u2013 On the 15th of Rajab, the soldiers of the Islamic State assassinated a university professor in the  city  of  Rajshahi  for  calling  to atheism. On the 22nd of Rajab, the soldiers of the Caliphate targeted a Hindu mushrik in the city of Tangail  who  was  known  for  insulting the  Prophet  Muhammad  g  and killed him by stabbing him with a knife. On the 29th of Sha\u2019ban, the soldiers  of  the  Khilafah  succeeded \nin  assassinating  Sunil  Gomes,  one of the Christian heads of disbelief. He was killed in the village of Bonpara in Northwest Bangladesh. On the 2nd of Ramadan, the soldiers of the Caliphate carried out a security operation in which they succeeded in killing a Hindu priest known as Ananta  Gopal  Ganguli  in  the  district of Jhenaidah in Western Bangladesh.  On  the  5th  of  Ramadan, the soldiers of the Caliphate assassinated a Hindu mushrik by stabbing him  with  knives.  On  the  27th  of Ramadan, five inghimasi soldiers of the Caliphate carried out an attack on the Artisan Restaurant, which is frequented  by  Crusader  foreigners of varying nationalities, in the city of  Dhaka.  The  mujahidin  held  a number of hostages as they engaged in a gun battle with apostate Bengali police, and succeeded in killing and injuring dozens of disbelievers before  attaining  shahadah.\nSomalia \u2013 On the 17th of Rajab,  the  soldiers  of  the  Caliphate detonated an explosive device on a military  vehicle  belonging  to  African  Crusader  forces  in  the  area  of Taridish in the city of Mogadishu, with the blast destroying part of the vehicle.  On  the  21st  of  Shawwal, they targeted three members of the Somali  security  forces,  killing  two of them and injuring the third, in \n\f", "schema:headline": "How I Came to Islam", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "36"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Rumiyah3", "@type": "schema:Article", "http://schema.org/isPartOf": [{"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rumiyah_(magazine)"}]}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq8-THE-ALLIES-OF-AL-Q\u0100\u2019IDAH-IN-SH\u0100M", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "8", "schema:articleBody": "THE ALLIES OF AL-Q\u0100\u2019IDAH IN SH\u0100M\nmade you peoples and tribes that you may know one another.

Second, it contradicts the creed of wal\u0101\u2019 and bar\u0101\u2019 \u2013 a great fundamental of the religion \u2013 and uproots it. The Arab Iraqi Christian is their brother who has all rights whereas the Indian  or  Turkish  Muslim  has  no  rights.

Third, it  opposes  the  bond  between  the  believers. Ras\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alahyi  wa  sallam)  said, \u2018The  believer  to  the  believer  is  like  a  building, each  part  holding  up  the  other\u2019  [Reported  by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim on the authority of Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 al-Ash\u2019ar\u012b]. He (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) also  said,  \u2018The  example  of  the  believers  with regards to their love, mercy, and sympathy is like that of a single body, if a limb feels pain, the rest of  the  body  responds  to  it  with  sleeplessness and fever\u2019 [Reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim on  the  authority  of  an-Nu\u2019m\u0101n  Ibn  Bash\u012br].  \u2026 Fourth, it is based upon the da\u2019wah to j\u0101hiliyyah and  partisanship.  Allah  (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101)  said,  {When those who disbelieved had put into their hearts hamiyyah \u2013 the hamiyyah of J\u0101hiliyyah} [Al-Fath: 26].  Ras\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam) said, \u2018Whoever calls to \u2018asabiyyah (factionalism) is not one of us\u2019 [Reported by Ab\u016b D\u0101w\u016bd on the authority of Jubayr Ibn Mut\u2019im]\u201d [Adhillah \u2018AlalMu\u2019min\u012bn A\u2019izzah \u2018Alal-K\u0101fir\u012bn].\nAm\u012brul-Mu\u2019min\u012bn  Ab\u016b \u2018Umar  al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (rahimahull\u0101h)  also  said,  \u201cSadly,  some  of  the fledglings of secularism spread the occupation\u2019s lie, formulated a basis for it, argued in favor of it, and raised the banner of blindness in the name of  nationalism  and  patriotism,  both  of  which are exactly what the Magian state constitution entails.  They  made  the  resources  of  Iraq  \u2013 especially  the  water  and  oil  \u2013  the  property  of those who possess Iraqi citizenship! So what if Ras\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  were to migrate to our lands? Indeed, he (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam)  migrated  to  a  land  other than his and settled in a home other than his. \n8 ARTICLE\nSo  are  those  resources  hal\u0101l  for  him  and  his Companions  in  accordance  with  the  doctrine of  these  people?  No.  As  for  him  (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) and the muh\u0101jir\u012bn after him having authority and leadership, then for that to occur would necessitate facing the harshest of opposition from these people! How not, when these people are those who said, \u2018Iraq is for all the  Iraqis  and  its  resources  are  the  property of all the Iraqis.\u2019 Yes, for all of the Iraqis, even if they are from the Yaz\u012bd\u012b devil worshippers or Sabian  Mandaeans.  All  of  them  according  to them  have  equal  rights  whether  he  is  a  Sunn\u012b Muslim or R\u0101fid\u012b Magian! It does not concern him whether this Iraqi worships our Glorious Lord or a rebellious devil. His right will be protected! O muwahhid\u012bn, our creed is that a Muslim is our brother  even  if  he  is  a  Filipino  Asian  and  that the devil worshipper is our enemy even if he is definitely Iraqi\u201d [Fa\u2019ammaz-Zabadu Fayadhhabu Juf\u0101\u2019\u0101].\nOn \u201c25 December 2014,\u201d the Sh\u0101miyyah Front was  announced  in  Aleppo.

Most of these factions are members of the nationalist Syrian Revolutionary Command Council.

How  exactly  the  nationalist  \u201cIslamists\u201d  plan  to implement  the  \u201cShar\u012b\u2019ah\u201d  alongside  Marxist and  democratic  secularists  is  unfathomable. One question to ask them is whether or not the crusader planes backing the PKK in \u2018Ayn al-Isl\u0101m will aid in the implementation of the \u201cShar\u012b\u2019ah\u201d\u2026\n\fpeople  concerning  them.  They  all  counseled him  to  accept  prayer  from  them  and  leave zak\u0101h up to them. So he said, \u2018By Allah, if they were to withhold a short rope that they used to give Ras\u016blull\u0101h (sallall\u0101hu \u2018alayhi wa sallam), I would wage jih\u0101d against them.\u2019 If not for what Ab\u016b  Bakr  had  done,  the  people  would  have practiced ilh\u0101d (heresy) concerning zak\u0101h until Resurrection Day\u201d [T\u0101r\u012bkh Dimashq].\n\u2018Umar (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anh) said, \u201cBy Allah, a day or night of Ab\u016b Bakr\u2019s (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anh) is better than \u2018Umar and the family of \u2018Umar since they were born \u2026 As for the day then it was the day that  Ras\u016blull\u0101h  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam) passed away and those who apostatized from the  Arabs  apostatized  and  said,  \u2018We  will  pray but not give zak\u0101h nor collect it. So I came to him never neglecting to advise him. I said, \u2018O Khal\u012bfah  of  Ras\u016blull\u0101h,  attract  the  people  and be soft with them, for it is as if they\u2019ve been deserted.\u2019  So  he  said,  \u2018I  had  hoped  for  your support and you came with your forsaking? Are you severe in J\u0101hiliyyah and cowardly in Islam? With what may I attract them? With contrived poetry  or  fabricated  sorcery?  That  can  never be!  The  Prophet  (sallall\u0101hu  \u2018alayhi  wa  sallam) passed away, the revelation has ceased, and the religion has been completed. Shall it decrease while I am still alive!

He  also  wrote  a  few  articles  on the crusades of the era fought by the West against the Muslims.\nAll  preparations  for  the  raids  in  Paris and Brussels started with him and his older brother Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. These two brothers gathered the weapons and the explosives. After the  blessed  raid  in  Paris,  he  saw  another dream, which motivated him to carry out an istishh\u0101d\u012b operation. He narrated, \u201cThe second  dream  was  three  months  ago.  It was a vision that took place from fajr until dhuhr. I arose to a high place, as if I was in space, surrounded by stars; but the sky was like the blue of night.\u201d He then heard a voice in the dream telling him that he was created only to worship Allah and ordering him to fight for His cause and make His word supreme. He then woke up.\nAb\u016b Wal\u012bd then narrated a third dream: \u201cI  had  a  vision  that  also  took  place  from fajr until dhuhr, but ended at night. I saw myself on a boat along with Ab\u016b Sulaym\u0101n and another brother. Each of us had a Turkish soldier as a hostage. I had a pistol and Ab\u016b Sulaym\u0101n had a belt. I told him to give me his belt, as I would feel better having it. So he gave me the belt and I gave him my pistol. I then quickly advanced with the Turkish hostage in order to close in on other soldiers, two of whom were in front of us. I detonated my belt, killing the soldiers. My head then descended to the ground. One of the brothers working on the operation and Shaykh al-\u2018Adn\u0101n\u012b took my head and said, \u2018Check to see if he is smiling or not.\u2019 I then saw my soul and those of the three soldiers. All of a sudden, the soldiers\u2019 souls burned and vanished and, suddenly, the banner of Islam  \u2013  represented  in  the  dream  by  the flag of the Islamic State \u2013 came out of the earth  and  was  shining  brightly.  My  soul then became full of light.\u201d He then heard a voice in the dream telling him that he had achieved  deliverance.  Ab\u016b  Wal\u012bd  continued,  \u201cI  prostrated  quickly  and  repeatedly pronounced  the  takb\u012br.

His hijrah began in \u201c2013,\u201d when he heard the cry of Muslims in Sh\u0101m. He joined Majlis Sh\u016br\u0101 al-Muj\u0101hid\u012bn led by Abul-Ath\u012br al\u2018Abs\u012b (may Allah accept him) and, when the traitor al-Jawl\u0101n\u012b betrayed the Islamic State, he was one of the first, along with the rest of his group, to pledge allegiance to Am\u012brul-Mu\u2019min\u012bn Ab\u016b Bakr al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b.\nHe participated in several battles against the Nusayr\u012b regime before the FSA apostates started to fight the muj\u0101hid\u012bn. Proving  himself  steadfast  during  the  sahwah  in  Sh\u0101m,  he fought them until the order came to withdraw to ar-Raqqah. He continued to participate in raids until he suffered a bullet wound to his leg in a raid against Jabhat al-Jawl\u0101n\u012b in alKhayr.\nAfter healing for several months, he began to train in order to realize his dream of returning to Europe to avenge the Muslims of Iraq and Sh\u0101m for the constant bombing by crusader warplanes. Upon completing his training, he traveled the long road to France to execute his operation. It was Ab\u016b Idr\u012bs who prepared the explosives for the two raids in Paris and Brussels.\nMuhammad Bilq\u0101\u2019id (Ab\u016b \u2018Abdil-\u2018Az\u012bz al-Jaz\u0101\u2019ir\u012b)Defended the Muj\u0101hid\u012bn During a Police Raid\nBefore returning to France, Ab\u016b \u2018Abdil-\u2018Az\u012bz participated in several raids against the Nusayr\u012b regime. The most prominent of these battles were those of Kuwayris Airbase and the 17th Division. During his campaigning, he suffered an injury to his leg while fighting the sahw\u0101t in Dimashq. He also took part in the conquest of ar-Ram\u0101d\u012b, where a bullet struck his head.He was a man full of wisdom, the commander of a group of  inghim\u0101s\u012b  troops.  Liked  by  all  of  the  brothers,  he  was known for his fasting, his praying throughout the night, and his constant reading of the Qur\u2019\u0101n. When he heard that Ab\u016b Idr\u012bs wanted to return to Europe to execute an istishh\u0101d\u012b operation, he immediately decided to accompany him and assist him in his mission.\nWhile in Belgium, and during the final stages of preparation for the raid in Brussels, k\u0101fir police stormed his apartment. Though he had the ability to escape with his team, he decided to make this his final stand and to ensure his brothers a  safe  exit.  He  exchanged  fire  with  the  Belgian  and  French forces  for  several  hours,  injuring  a  number  of  them,  as  his brothers took off into the forest.\n7\fThe Ruling on Riddah\nThe ruling of the person who commits riddah is \nthat he is killed, unless he repents before he is apprehended. Allah\u2019s Messenger g sent Mu\u2019\u0101dh Ibn Jabal h to Yemen to assist Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 al-Ash\u2019ar\u012b h with ruling the people according to the Shar\u012b\u2019ah. When he arrived at the court assembly, he found there a man bound in chains. He asked Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101, \u201cWho is this?\u201d He replied, \u201cHe was a Jew who accepted Islam and then became a Jew again. Sit.\u201d Mu\u2019\u0101dh said, \u201cI will not sit until he is killed. Such is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger! Such is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger! Such is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger!\u201d So Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 gave the order and he was killed [Reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim]. His repeated statement, that \u201csuch is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger,\u201d is a clear evidence that the ruling of one who leaves Islam after he is apprehended is that he is killed.\nAs for repenting before being caught, then Allah said, {Say, \u201cO My slaves, those who have transgressed against  themselves,  do  not  despair  of  the  mercy  of Allah. Verily, Allah forgives all sins. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. And repent to your Lord and surrender to Him before the punishment reaches you; then  you  will  not  be  helped\u201d}  [Az-Zumar:  53-54]. Likewise,  and  specifically  about  the  apostate,  Allah \nThe punishment for apostasy\nsaid, {How would Allah guide a people who disbelieved  after  they  believed,  having  testified  that  the Messenger is true, and clear evidences reached them, and  Allah  does  not  guide  tyrannical  people.  Those, their reward is that the curse of Allah, the angels, and all of mankind is upon them, abiding therein forever. The torment does not lessen for them, nor are they given respite, except those who repent thereafter and correct themselves, for verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful} [\u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 87-89]. It should then be no surprise  that  Am\u012brul-Mu\u2019min\u012bn  Ab\u016b  Bakr  al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (hafidhahull\u0101h)  declared  that  any  of  the  apostates from the sahw\u0101t or otherwise who repent to Allah and surrender themselves to the Islamic State will be guaranteed amnesty, even if they had killed a million muj\u0101hid\u012bn. But those who are caught before they repent, then there is no amnesty for them and theirs shall be a painful \u2013 and fatal \u2013 punishment.\nHistorical Examples\nDuring  the  life  and  mission  of  the  Prophet  g, \nthe issue of riddah arose on a few occasions. The most famous case was that of the \u2018Ukl\u012b\u2013\u2018Uran\u012b apostates. Some men from the tribes of \u2018Ukl and \u2018Uraynah came to al-Mad\u012bnah, entered upon the Prophet g, and announced their Islam. They then said to him, \u201cO  Prophet  of  Allah!

Such sacrifices mirror the hardship and difficulty faced by so many Muslims who have embarked upon the path to make hijrah to the lands of jih\u0101d. Many were forced to make a choice to either leave behind their comfort and luxury, their families  and  friends,  their  wives  and children,  and  their  wealth  and  businesses,  or  to  abandon  jih\u0101d  for  the cause of Allah. Allah \uf063 said, {Say, \u201cIf your  fathers,  your  sons,  your  brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which  you  have  obtained,  commerce wherein  you  fear  decline,  and  dwellings  with  which  you  are  pleased  are more  beloved  to  you  than  Allah  and His Messenger and jih\u0101d in His cause, then  wait  until  Allah  executes  His command. And Allah does not guide the  defiantly  disobedient  people\u201d} [At-Tawbah:  24].  As  such,  Syed  Rizwan Farook and his wife chose Allah \uf063 and the Hereafter over the Duny\u0101, just as the Sah\u0101bah did so before them.\nFor  those  who  wonder  how  anyone could possibly leave their children behind in order to fight and be killed for \nthe sake of Allah, we remind them of Allah\u2019s  promise  to  care  for  those  left behind by the believers. Allah \uf063 said, {Indeed,  those  who  have  said,  \u201cOur Lord is Allah\u201d and then remained on a right course \u2013 the angels will descend upon them, saying, \u201cDo not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings of Jannah, which you were promised. We  [angels]  were  your  allies  in  the worldly life and are so in the Hereafter\u201d} [Fussilat: 30-31]. Im\u0101m Muj\u0101hid, the  famous  mufassir  of  the  T\u0101bi\u2019\u012bn, said that the meaning of {Do not fear and do not grieve} is, \u201cDo not fear that which you are heading to of the affairs of  the  Hereafter,  and  do  not  grieve over  what  you\u2019ve  left  behind  of  your Duny\u0101, including family and children, for  we  will  look  after  all  of  that  for you\u201d  [At-Tabar\u012b].\nThus, the believers who do trade with Allah will never lose, rather, they only stand to profit. {O you who have believed, shall I guide you to a transaction that will save you from a painful punishment? It is that you believe in Allah  and  His  Messenger  and  strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is best for you, if you should know. He will forgive for you  your  sins  and  admit  you  to  gardens  beneath  which  rivers  flow  and pleasant  dwellings  in  gardens  of  per-\npetual residence. That is the great attainment}  [As-Saff:  10-12].\nMay Allah accept the sacrifices of our noble brother Syed Rizwan Farook and his  blessed  wife,  accept  them  among the  shuhad\u0101\u2019,  and  use  their  deeds  as a means to awaken more Muslims in America,  Europe,  and  Australia.\nSyed and his wife did not hold back from  fulfilling  their  obligation  despite having a daughter to care for\nSyed Rizwan Farook after attaining shah\u0101dah (may Allah accept him)\nFOREWORD\n\fOn  the  21st  of  Rab\u012b\u2019  al-Awwal,  the t\u0101gh\u016bt regime of \u0100l Sa\u2019\u016bd, with the approval of their judges and the support of  their  scholastic  stooges,  executed dozens  of  great  men  whose  only  \u201coffense\u201d was preaching tawh\u012bd and waging  jih\u0101d  in  the  path  of  Allah.  Most prominent  among  those  killed  were the scholars Ab\u016b Jandal al-Azd\u012b (F\u0101ris \u0100l Shuwayl az-Zahr\u0101n\u012b), Hamd al-Humayd\u012b,  and  \u2018Abdul-\u2018Az\u012bz  at-Tuwayli\u2019\u012b, may Allah accept them all amongst the shuhad\u0101\u2019. Allah \uf063 said, {And do not say of those killed in the path of Allah, \u201cThey are dead.\u201d Rather, they are alive but you do not perceive} [Al-Baqarah: 154].\nSince the establishment of their present state, the Saudi regime is well known to have committed more than one nullifier of Islam. The images and videos of  Saudi  \u201croyals\u201d  dancing,  prancing, and even kissing their crusader counterparts  as  these  \u201croyals\u201d  support  the crusaders  in  the  wars  against  Islam and Muslims are famous enough that no one can deny their show of mutual love,  and  Allah  \uf063  said,  {You  do  not find any people believing in Allah and the  Last  Day  having  mutual  love  for whoever opposed Allah and His Messenger}  [Al-Muj\u0101dilah:  22].\nBut for one reason or another, many ignorant people often neglect to recognize the reality of the regime\u2019s palace scholars,  which  is  that  these  scholars \nThe  martyred  shaykh,  Ab\u016b  Jandal al-Azd\u012b  (may  Allah  accept  him)\nThe martyred shaykh, Hamd al-Humayd\u012b (may Allah accept him)\nare  undoubtedly  murtadd\u012bn.  Their apostasy is even grosser than any other, having studied the clear texts proving their collapse into kufr. They have sought to justify the apostasy of their masters with deception, embroidering their arguments with misquoted \u0101y\u0101t, ah\u0101d\u012bth, and \u0101th\u0101r from the Salaf. In the  severest  terms,  they  have  advised the  youth  to  reject  the  true  meaning of jih\u0101d and to replace it with national pride. The \u201chukm of Allah\u201d to them is whatever the Saudi governmental ministries have deemed acceptable. Therefore, it must be understood that these scholars are not simply silent bystanders in the background.\nRather, the palace scholars of the Saudi  regime  \u2013  from  their  \u201cGrand  Muft\u012b\u201d  \u2018Abdul-\u2018Az\u012bz  \u0100l  ash-Shaykh  to  the minions  who  spread  deceitful  prot\u0101gh\u016bt propaganda atop the pulpits of their \u201ckingdom\u201d \u2013 are at the forefront \nof  this  effort  to  dissuade  Muslims from  jih\u0101d  and  from  upholding  the Shar\u012b\u2019ah, averting them from the path of Allah. Hiding behind claims of being  \u201cSunn\u012b,\u201d  \u201cHanbal\u012b,\u201d  \u201cSalaf\u012b,\u201d  and especially descendants and students of Muhammad Ibn \u2018Abdil-Wahh\u0101b, they are truly nothing more than slaves of t\u0101gh\u016bt,  waging  war  against  the  muj\u0101hid\u012bn in order to maintain the status quo. It was Ibn \u2018Abdil-Wahh\u0101b r who mentioned  among  the  ten  greatest nullifiers  of  Islam,  \u201cEighth:  Backing the mushrik\u012bn and aiding them against the  Muslims.  The  evidence  is  His  \uf063 saying, {And whoever allies with them of you, then indeed he is of them. Verily Allah does not guide the tyrannical people}\u201d [Ar-Ras\u0101\u2019il ash-Shakhsiyyah].\nWhen asked about the clear disparity between  the  Qur\u2019\u0101n-backed  creed  of Muhammad  Ibn  \u2018Abdil-Wahh\u0101b  and the  Saudi  regime\u2019s  constant  coalition with  crusaders  against  Muslims,  palace  scholar  H\u0101tim  al-\u2018Awn\u012b  criticized Ibn  \u2018Abdil-Wahh\u0101b  and  considered this one of the reasons for a required revision of the texts written by the historic scholars of Najd.\nIn  their  \u201cjustification\u201d  of  murdering muj\u0101hid\u012bn, the Saudis stated that the plans of some of these brothers were \u201cto damage the nation\u2019s economy and harm  the  Kingdom\u2019s  status  [and]  its relations  and  interests  with  brotherly and  friendly  countries,\u201d  specifically mentioning  \u201cby  storming  the  U.S. Consulate  in  Jeddah.\u201d  Such  attacks on the regime\u2019s brothers-in-kufr were \n\f", "schema:headline": "FOREWORD", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "3"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq12-FROM-THE-PAGES-OF-HISTORY:-B\u0100QIYAH", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "12", "schema:articleBody": "Probably the most memorable day after September 11th for many muwahhid\u012bn was the day the Islamic State was announced nine years ago in Iraq (Ramad\u0101n 1427). It was a state based upon tawh\u012bd and jih\u0101d with a Qurash\u012b im\u0101m. It was a foundation for the future khil\u0101fah. Its leadership disbelieved in defeatist compromise and relied upon Allah alone, even if such entailed being fought by the entire camp of kufr and deviance.\nA few months later, the Iraqi Sahwah was launched. The Americans  provided  corrupt  tribes  and  partisan  factions with the incentive and aid for the newly formed Sahwah to wage a treacherous war against the Islamic State. The Islamic State then, in 1427-1428AH, began losing territory to these crusader-backed apostates. It was experiencing just some of the tests and tribulations that all truthful believers face, as in the had\u012bth, \u201cThe people who face the severest tribulations are the Prophets, then those most like them, then  those  most  like  them.  A  person  is  tested  with  tribulation to the extent of his religious practice. If his practice is strong, the tribulation he faces is stronger. And if his practice is weak, the tribulation he faces is in accordance with his religious practice\u201d [Sah\u012bh: Reported by at-Tirmidh\u012b from Sa\u2019d Ibn Ab\u012b Waqq\u0101s].\nDuring the tumult of this Sahwah conspiracy, a point came in which it appeared to the weak-hearted that the Islamic State would be a legend of the past, reminding us of the Battle of al-Ahz\u0101b {when they came at you from above you and from below you, and when eyes turned upwards [in fear], and hearts reached the throats and you assumed about Allah various assumptions. There the believers were tested and shaken severely. And remember when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease said, \u201cAllah and His \nMessenger did not promise us except delusion\u201d} [Al-Ahz\u0101b: 10-12]. This was what occurred throughout the events of the Sahwah in Iraq. The believers were shaken severely but remained firm, whereas the hypocrites came out and began to criticize the creed and methodology of the Islamic State.\nAnd despite these great tribulations; a man spoke out with a truthful tongue and sincere heart; we consider him such and Allah is his judge. He was the recently appointed Am\u012br of the Believers, Shaykh Ab\u016b \u2018Umar al-Husayn\u012b al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (may Allah accept him). He spoke his words holding good assumptions about Allah, being certain of Allah\u2019s promise, and having no doubts that Allah would ever forsake them. He said in his famous speech \u201cThe Harvest of the Years by the State of the Muwahhid\u012bn,\u201d released six months after the declaration of the Islamic State in Iraq and during the dark waves of the Sahwah:\n\u201cThe Islamic State is b\u0101qiyah (remaining). It is b\u0101qiyah because it was built from the corpses of the shuhad\u0101\u2019 and it was watered with their blood, and by this the market of Jannah was convened. It is b\u0101qiyah because the success granted by Allah in this jih\u0101d is clearer than the sun in the middle of the sky. It is b\u0101qiyah because it was not soiled by har\u0101m income nor a distorted methodology. It is b\u0101qiyah by the truthfulness of the leaders who sacrificed their blood and the truthfulness of the soldiers who raised it with their forearms; we consider them such, and Allah is their judge. It is b\u0101qiyah because it united the muj\u0101hid\u012bn and is the refuge of the oppressed. It is b\u0101qiyah because Islam has begun to rise  and  climb,  the  dark  cloud  has  begun  to  scatter,  and kufr has begun to be defeated and exposed.

They prohibited what He permitted, and permitted what He prohibited, and one of the most manifest things that they ruined and defamed in defense of women and their rights \u2013 as they claimed  \u2013  was  polygyny.  They  utilized  their  podiums  to that end, including the podiums of the kufr\u012b parliaments and the secular TV channels, and placed on these podiums howling dogs, fools who do not perceive nor know their foolishness. Their poisoned words crept into the hearts of women from the lands of the Muslims, to the point that we almost couldn\u2019t find a single woman that is accepting of this issue, except for those whom Allah protected.\nAllah c said in His clear-cut revelation, {And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then mar-\nry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice]} [An-Nis\u0101\u2019: 3]. This is a verse as clear as the sun that does not require extensive explanation or interpretation. Therefore, O slaves of Allah, you may marry two, three, or four women, unless you fear that you will have shortcomings in your fairness towards them or will fail to fulfill their rights, in which case you suffice with one wife. Ibn Kath\u012br r said, \u201cHis statement {two or three or four} [An-Nis\u0101\u2019: 3] means marry any women  you  wish  apart  from  the  orphans.  If  one  of  you wishes he may marry two, and if he wishes, three, and if he wishes, four.\u201d\nIndeed, Islam was not the first to introduce polygyny. Rather, it was present in the shar\u012b\u2019ah of those before us. Allah\u2019s Messenger g said, \u201cSulaym\u0101n Ibn D\u0101w\u016bd q said, \u2018I will surely  have  intercourse  with  a  hundred  women  tonight, or ninety nine, and every one of them will give birth to a knight who will wage jih\u0101d for the cause of Allah\u2026\u2019\u201d [Reported from Ab\u016b Hurayrah by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b].\nWhat\u2019s  strange  is  that  the  Jews  and  the  Christians  taunt the Muslims with respect to polygyny, yet if they were to look into their own books they would\u2019ve known that it was something present in their religions, for it is stated in their books that Ya\u2019q\u016bb n had two wives and two concubines, and that D\u0101w\u016bd n had a number of wives and concubines, as mentioned in 2 Samuel [5: 13] and 1 Samuel [25: 42 \u2013 \n191919\nNOTHINGTWO, THREE, OR FOUR\n\f", "schema:headline": "FROM THE PAGES OF HISTORY: B\u0100QIYAH", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "17"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq13-INTERVIEW-WITH-THE-W\u0100L\u012a-OF-KHUR\u0100S\u0100N", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "13", "schema:articleBody": "This month, D\u0101biq interviewed the W\u0101l\u012b of Khur\u0101s\u0101n Shaykh  H\u0101fidh  Sa\u2019\u012bd  Kh\u0101n  (hafidhahull\u0101h)  and  asked him  several  questions  regarding  the  Wil\u0101yah  and  the situation on the ground there. We present the interview below.\nD\u0101biq: How is the situation in Wil\u0101yat Khur\u0101s\u0101n? Does the Islamic State have territory there with tamk\u012bn (consolidation)? Are the visible aspects of tamk\u012bn there similar to what is manifest in Sh\u0101m and Iraq?\nThe W\u0101l\u012b: Alhamdulill\u0101h, the situation in Khur\u0101s\u0101n brings good  tidings,  by  Allah\u2019s  permission.  We  have  achieved tamk\u012bn in the Wil\u0101yah, but not on the same level as Iraq and Sh\u0101m in terms of the magnitude of territory on the ground. The lands of Khur\u0101s\u0101n are very vast and include \u201cAfghanistan,\u201d western \u201cPakistan,\u201d and other lands that the murtadd\u012bn had taken over. We have conquered and gained consolidation in five \u201cadministrative regions\u201d here, walhamdulill\u0101h, and in terms of the visible aspects of tamk\u012bn, we \u2013 by Allah\u2019s grace \u2013 establish Allah\u2019s law therein and implement the hud\u016bd. We have established judicial courts in these regions, offices for hisbah, offices for zak\u0101h, and others for education, da\u2019wah and mas\u0101jid, and public services. We set up a specific division for every shar\u2019\u012b and administrative duty therein and appointed qualified and specialized officials based on the personnel available from amongst the muh\u0101jir\u012bn and ans\u0101r in the Wil\u0101yah.\nThe hisbah in Wil\u0101yat Khur\u0101s\u0101n leveling graves\nD\u0101biq: What is the importance of Wil\u0101yat Khur\u0101s\u0101n to Islam and the Muslims? What are the difficulties the Wil\u0101yah faces?\nThe W\u0101l\u012b: Wil\u0101yat Khur\u0101s\u0101n has great importance to Islam and the Muslims. It had once been under the authority of the Muslims, along with the regions surrounding it. Afterwards, the secularist and R\u0101fid\u012b murtadd\u012bn conquered some  of  these  regions,  and  the  cow-worshipping  Hindus and atheist Chinese conquered other nearby regions, as is the case in parts of Kashmir and Turkistan. So the Wil\u0101yah, \nby Allah\u2019s permission, is a gate to re-conquering all these regions until they are ruled once more by Allah\u2019s law, and so the territory of the blessed Khil\u0101fah is expanded.\nAlso, the people of Khur\u0101s\u0101n in general love Islam and warfare, and because of this, the region has a dormant force for supporting tawh\u012bd and jih\u0101d. Thus, as the reality of the Khil\u0101fah becomes more clear to the people of Khur\u0101s\u0101n, they will join the Wil\u0101yah at a greater rate and strengthen its jih\u0101d against the enemies of Islam and the Muslims, including the kuff\u0101r, the murtadd\u012bn, and those who ally with them inside and outside the region. As such, they will be a strong building block for the Khil\u0101fah in this part of the world. And the coming generations will be raised upon the Book and the Sunnah from a young age. This is a tremendous grace that has reached this region by way of this khil\u0101fah, which is upon the prophetic methodology, and by way of our im\u0101m and khal\u012bfah, Ab\u016b Bakr al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b al-Qurash\u012b.\nAs for the difficulties, then they are nothing but the t\u0101gh\u016bt enemies of Allah \u2013 including \u201cPakistan\u201d on one side, and \u201cAfghanistan\u201d  on  the  other  \u2013  standing  with  their  armies and intelligence agencies against Islam, its khil\u0101fah, and the wil\u0101yah that represents it and implements its methodology in the region. These two governments attempt to create  many  problems  in  order  to  obstruct  the  jih\u0101d  of  the Wil\u0101yah and thereby hinder the establishment of Islam and its methodology in the region. They attempt to stop the expansion  of  the  Khil\u0101fah.  Such  is  also  the  condition  of those organizations that these two governments produce, support, or take advantage of, and to whom they extend aid, and for whom they pave the way. This leads these organizations, such as the nationalist Taliban movement, to instigate various problems in order to wage war against the Khil\u0101fah. But how impossible it is for all these organizations and others to extinguish the light of Allah! For this is a khil\u0101fah that rose upon the prophetic methodology and upon the foundation of tawh\u012bd, thus all these taw\u0101gh\u012bt together will not be able to stand before its lions \u2013 the lions of tawh\u012bd and \u2018aq\u012bdah. The taw\u0101gh\u012bt succeeded against the \u201cIslamic\u201d organizations and movements that held flimsy creeds and deficient methodologies, whether they were \u201cda\u2019wah\u201d-oriented or \u201cjih\u0101d\u201d-oriented. As for the Khil\u0101fah, it is a thorn \u2013 rather, an axe! \u2013 in the necks of the kuff\u0101r and murtadd\u012bn in this region, by Allah\u2019s power and strength.\nD\u0101biq: Does the nationalist Taliban movement have areas of consolidation in Khur\u0101s\u0101n? And do they rule them by Allah\u2019s law?\nThe  W\u0101l\u012b:  The  nationalist  Taliban  movement  only  has control  of  some  regions  of  \u201cAfghanistan,\u201d  nowhere  else. As for ruling them by Allah\u2019s law, then it does not do that. Rather, they rule by tribal customs and judge affairs in accordance with the desires and traditions of the people, tra-\n\f", "schema:headline": "INTERVIEW WITH THE W\u0100L\u012a OF KHUR\u0100S\u0100N", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "48"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq6-IN-THE-WORDS-OF-THE-ENEMY-", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "6", "schema:articleBody": "clude Nusayr\u012b regime targets.

We\u2019ve never seen anything quite like that in one institution. Then they blend in ideology which will eventually lose*, we get that, and social media. The sophistication of their social media program is something that we\u2019ve never seen before. You blend  all  of  that  together,  that  is  an  incredibly powerful new threat.

It is durable, you  can  exchange  it  for  goods,  and  it\u2019s  worth as much or more today as it was thousands of years ago. Now that\u2019s real money.\nIt\u2019s  amazing  to  think  that  a  lump  of  gold  that may  have  been  used  for  trade  thousands  of years ago is still in circulation. It may have been melted down and be part of a bullion bar or it may be worn around someone\u2019s neck, but it\u2019s still around. Try that with a piece of paper.\nWHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT MONEY?\nLast month the Islamic State announced plans to mint their own range of gold dinars and silver dirhams in a move to separate themselves from dollar-linked fiat currencies and to establish their own money, a currency that has intrinsic value.\nAny  country  needs  its  own  currency  and  a move by the Islamic State to gold dinars would be a smart one in today\u2019s turbulent markets. Financial website Quartz wrote, \u201cThe gold dinar taps into a deep history of Islamic coinage that stretches back almost to the time of Muhammad himself. The Islamic dinar appeared in 696 AD, when the Umayyad empire \u2013 based in Damascus \u2013 stretched from the Iberian peninsula to the Indus River in South Asia.\u201d\nAnd the value of gold is soaring. In 2006, I possessed a 1 kg bar of gold that was worth, at the time, around $17,000. Sadly it wasn\u2019t mine; a bullion  dealer  loaned  it  to  me  for  an  article. Staff from all over the building heard about it and would come to ogle over its beauty. Pure gold  makes  people  go  a  bit  strange  like  that. But if I\u2019d had the money to buy it, that same bar would be worth over $60,000 today.\nAs they move to expand the Caliphate, it would \nTHE ISLAMIC STATE HAS ANNOUNCED THE MINTING OF NEW COINS\ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "IN THE WORDS OF THE ENEMY ", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "56"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq10-HIKMAH", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "10", "schema:articleBody": "dabiq\n\fOn  the  29th  of  Sha\u2019b\u0101n  in  the  year 1436AH,  after  a  crusader  airstrike, a  warrior  from  the  warriors  of  the Khil\u0101fah  travelled  from  this  fading Duny\u0101  to  that  which  is  everlasting. The  brother  T\u0101riq  Ibn  at-T\u0101hir  alHarz\u012b  \u2013  otherwise  known  as  Ab\u016b \u2018Umar  at-Tunus\u012b  \u2013  was  killed  in Wil\u0101yat al-Barakah, completing a life of  jih\u0101d  and  many  years  of  service working  to  help  build  the  Islamic State  and  reestablish  the  Khil\u0101fah. He had, throughout his jih\u0101d in both Ir\u0101q and Sh\u0101m, a number of different titles and held a number of different positions.\nA veteran of many years in the Islamic State, the brother first made hijrah to Iraq in 2003. He became acquainted with some of the legends of the Iraqi jih\u0101d such as Ab\u016b Mus\u2019ab az-Zarq\u0101w\u012b and  Ab\u016b  Hamzah  al-Muh\u0101jir  (may Allah accept them both). The former, as  the  jih\u0101d  progressed,  made  a request for the brother to come to alFall\u016bjah. It was a call to which Ab\u016b \u2018Umar  responded,  living  great  days in the city that stood defiantly in the \nface  of  the  American  transgression on  the  lands  of  the  Muslims. Time passed,  many  kuff\u0101r  were  sent  to Jahannam,  and  the  brother  was  hit by  a  crusader  airstrike  in  which  all those who were with him were killed. This time Allah \uf062 saved him and he emerged  relatively  unharmed.  He was  later  hit  by  a  second  airstrike, resulting in his leg being severed (he later  became  well  known  for  this physical attribute).\nThe  brother  was  imprisoned  twice in Iraq, the first time escaping with a fake document under the pretense that he was Iraqi and not a muh\u0101jir. The  Americans  were  enraged  upon discovering  the  true  identity  of  the man who had slipped through their inept  fingers.  The  second  time  was in 2008 after he was sentenced to 15 years. He and a group of his muj\u0101hid brothers escaped during an operation by  the  Islamic  State  to  liberate  the T\u0101j\u012b  prison.  He  was  subsequently sent  to  land  of  Sh\u0101m  and  was made  responsible  for  receiving  the istishh\u0101diyy\u012bn  and  appointed  the \nam\u012br of the Atmah gateway. He was a brave leader during the war against the sahwah treachery and was famous for his saying, \u201cAllah will never grant them  victory  over  us.  We  defeated them in Iraq, and we will also defeat them  in  Sh\u0101m,  by  Allah\u2019s  bounty alone.\u201d\nAb\u016b \u2018Umar was known for practicing zuhd with respect to his clothes and his food, earning the love and respect of  many  after  reaching  the  blessed land  of  Sh\u0101m.  After  relocating, he  settled  in  Wil\u0101yat  al-Barakah, eventually  being  appointed  as  the am\u012br  of  the  wil\u0101yah\u2019s  artillery.  This beloved  brother  and  veteran  was killed  24  hours  after  his  brother Abuz-Zubayr \u2018Al\u012b al-Harz\u012b was killed in  Mosul.  The  two  brothers,  both avid  boxers,  together  terrorized  the kuff\u0101r, leaving this world in the same way as each other.\nHe  was  a  thorn  in  the  sides  of  the disbelieving  crusaders  and  their  slaves from  amongst  the  apostates.

The  few  examples from  the  Salaf  they  quoted  and distorted  involved  concealment  of  a leader\u2019s  death  only  for  a  short  time and  only  from  a  small  part  of  the Muslim army engaged in battle, not for  months  and  years  and  certainly not from the entire Ummah!\nThe  hizb\u012b  (partisan)  \u201cscholars\u201d  then exaggerated  the  ruling  on  lying  for the  sake  of  war  and  reconciliation to  include  lying  open-endedly  to the  worldwide  Muslim  Ummah  in its  entirety  from  the  far  East  to  the distant West including all its scholars, leaders,  fighters,  and  men,  all  for the  sake  of  some  loosely-defined \u201cmaslahah.\u201d  They  even  permitted speech to be fabricated in the name of  a  dead  man  only  to  prevent  the unification of the Ummah under the obligation  of  Khil\u0101fah  and  to  bind it  through  chains  of  taql\u012bd  (blind following)  to  the  evil  of  hizbiyyah (partisanship)!

The  Carnegie Endowment  wrote  on  \u201c20  April  2015,\u201d  \u201cThe Islamic  State  seeks  to  infiltrate  Jordan  in  many ways. Its most effective way of establishing itself is not by attacking across the border, but by coopting Jordanian  extremist  factions  and  exploiting  the simmering  social  discontent  among  Jordanian youth. To  counter  these  trends,  the  government has sought to exploit divisions between al-Qaeda and  the  Islamic  State,  releasing  some  clerics  [alMaqdis\u012b and al-Filist\u012bn\u012b] aligned with the former group  and  allowing  them  a  degree  of  media visibility.\u201d\nThis  policy  was  even  suggested  for  Afghanistan and  Pakistan,  as  the  Islamic  State\u2019s  presence there threatened regional stability. The crusaders of War on the Rocks wrote on \u201c13 April 2015,\u201d \u201cThis much is clear, however: Mullah Omar still matters  \u2013  especially  in  South  Asia,  where  two important  developments  are  playing  out.  Both are directly tied to stability, which is Washington\u2019s chief  interest  in  the  region.  And  regardless  of his  fate,  Mullah  Omar  will  have  an  impact  on each  of  them.  Development  number  one  is  the deepening influence of the Islamic State in South Asia. \u2026 The second key trend is Kabul\u2019s pursuit \ndabiq\nThe Carnegie Endowment - A major crusader think-tank\npragmatism.

This  approach  has  enabled  the  Nusra  Front  to widen its network of support quickly, including the addition of some Free Syrian Army brigades in Aleppo, Hama, and Daraa.\u201d\nThis description of the Jawl\u0101n\u012b front was mirrored in another piece written by the crusaders of Middle East Eye on \u201c30 April 2015.\u201d After describing the \u201cpragmatism\u201d  of  the  Jawl\u0101n\u012b  front  (cooperation with  everyone  and  non-implementation  of  the hud\u016bd),  the  author  said,  \u201cNusra  could  also benefit  from  US  airstrikes  against  IS.  The  US listed the Nusra Front a terrorist organisation in December  2012,  long  before  the  emergence  of IS, but since last year the US-led intervention in Syria and Iraq has largely focused on the aim of degrading and \u2018ultimately destroying\u2019 IS.

Only All\u0101h (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) knows the minutest details of everything, controls all events, and possesses every atomic particle. Even the pagans of the J\u0101hiliyyah in the Arabian Peninsula did not doubt that Allah alone  possessed  absolute  power,  knowledge,  and ownership,  but  they  committed  shirk  in  many ways  including  attributing  partial  knowledge  of the unseen to soothsayers, assigning shares of their crops  and  livestock  to  idols,  and  claiming  their idols held some influence to intercede for them. As for claiming their idols, soothsayers, and kings had absolute or near-absolute power, knowledge, \nand ownership, then this was too much for even the corrupted fitrah of the j\u0101hiliyy\u012bn to tolerate.\nSadly, this shirk\u012b attitude (both minor and major) entered the hearts and minds of many supposedly \u201cIslamic\u201d  leaders,  scholars,  and  callers  \u2013  in imitation of the Arab nationalists before them \u2013 as  they  began  to  describe  the  enemies  of  Islam with  attributes  bordering  rub\u016bbiyyah  (Allah\u2019s lordship).  To  them,  the  kuff\u0101r  had  the  nearabsolute knowledge, power, and ownership to plot and execute any grand conspiracy of their desire. It is almost as if they attribute to them the ability to create with the word \u201cbe\u201d! Their evil became most apparent in issues related to jih\u0101d. If one desired to perform jih\u0101d, these leaders would warn that jih\u0101d now was a conspiracy to kill off the sincere Muslim youth and thereby leave the Muslims\u2019 lands to the secularists. If one wanted to join a jih\u0101d jam\u0101\u2019ah, they  would  warn  that  it  was  the  creation  of  the kuff\u0101r so as to aid in achieving k\u0101fir interests. If jih\u0101d  operations  \u2013  like  those  of  September  11th \u2013 were carried out against the kuff\u0101r, they would claim  these  operations  were  conspiracies  by  the kuff\u0101r to justify their aggression against Muslims. If  a  muj\u0101hid  leader  achieved  shah\u0101dah,  they would say that the kuff\u0101r used him up and needed \nThe blessed raid on the Twin Towersin New York\ndabiq\n\fthe  crusaders!  He  did  not  wage  jih\u0101d  for  Allah\u2019s cause to rid the Muslims\u2019 lands of manmade laws and  pagan  domes  and  thereby  establish  a  shar\u2019\u012b khil\u0101fah.  Rather  he  fought  merely  to  unify  the \u201cArab\u201d lands alone under a nationalist \u201ccaliphate\u201d that he would rule over, but under the direction of his new crusader masters.\nDuring the various battles he and his sons led in the \u201cArab Revolt,\u201d their soldiers were accompanied and  supported  by  British  crusaders  including Colonel  Cyril  Wilson,  Colonel  Pierce  C.  Joyce, Lieutenant  Colonel  Stewart  Francis  Newcombe, Herbert Garland, and Captain T.E. Lawrence (the so-called \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d), French crusaders including  Colonel  Edouard  Bremond,  Captain Rosario  Pisanim,  Claude  Prost,  and  Laurent Depui,  and  French  apostates  including  Captain Muhammad  Ould  Ali  Raho.  The  British  would even  intervene  with  their  navy  and  air  force  in battles to give al-Husayn and his sons the upper hand against their rivals. Al-Husayn and his sons meticulously obeyed the orders dictated to them by  the  British  crusaders  so  as  to  guarantee  their backing.  The  British  eventually  appointed  them as kings over Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Hij\u0101z. The current  t\u0101gh\u016bt  of  Jordan  is  a  descendent  of  this same family.\nBlack  was  chosen  to  represent  the  \u2018Abb\u0101s\u012b  state, white  to  represent  the  Umaw\u012b  state,  green  to represent the \u2018Ubayd\u012b (\u201cF\u0101tim\u012b\u201d) state, and red to represent  the  late  \u201cShar\u012bf\u201d2  leadership  of  Hij\u0101z. In  this  symbolism,  he  mixed  between  Islamic khulaf\u0101\u2019,  apostate  Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bliyyah,  and  apostate agents.  He  needed  to  give  his  Arab  followers something  symbolic,  historical,  material,  and uniquely  \u201cArabian\u201d  for  them  to  rally  around. This j\u0101hil\u012b banner became the flag of the so-called \u201cArab Revolt\u201d he engineered. The flag was initially manufactured in Egypt by the British Military to be raised by their allies.\nSykes\u2019s allies from amongst the Arab nationalists used  a  line  of  poetry  written  by  Saf\u012b  ad-D\u012bn  alHill\u012b  \u2013  who  died  in  750AH  \u2013  to  endorse  these j\u0101hil\u012b symbols. Al-Hill\u012b said, \u201cOur deeds are white, our battles are black, our fields are green, and our swords are red.\u201d No doubt, his line of poetry was written hundreds of years before the \u201cArab Revolt.\u201d\nSykes, together with his peers and leaders, devised a  plan  to  further  divide  the  broken  Muslims\u2019 lands  into  nationalist  states.  The  Muslims\u2019  lands had  been  polluted  by  pagan  domes  (for  grave worship)  and  plagued  by  manmade  laws  at  the hands of Ottoman rulers, especially in the last two centuries before the eventual collapse of Ottoman reign.  This  fragile  condition  coupled  with  the policy of turkification \u2013 which promoted Turkish nationalism and degraded the Arabic language \u2013 aided Sykes and his allies in promoting the \u201cArab Revolt.\u201d\nThe  British  began  negotiating  with alHusayn  Ibn  \u2018Al\u012b3    (the  \u201cShar\u012bf\u201d  of  Hij\u0101z  \u2013  died 1350AH/1931CE)  to  rebel  and  declare  an independent  Arab  nationalist  state.  Al-Husyan Ibn  \u2018Al\u012b  revolted  against  his  former  Ottoman masters and declared himself, with the permission of  the  British,  \u201cSultan  of  the  Arab  Lands\u201d  and \u201cCaliph\u201d over a nationalist \u201ccaliphate\u201d erected by 2 The  word  literarily  means  \u201cthe  noble.\u201d  The  leaders  of  Hij\u0101z  (Makkah,  al-Mad\u012bnah,  and surrounding regions) since 597AH/1200CE up until 1344AH/1925CE all descended from Qat\u0101dah Ibn Idr\u012bs al-Hasan\u012b (died 618AH) and were referred to by the title \u201cshar\u012bf\u201d because of their Hasan\u012b lineage. Because of the later generations\u2019 apostasy through shirk and wal\u0101\u2019 to the apostates and the crusaders, they are not deserving of this praiseworthy title.\n3 Because the names are similar, it should be noted that everywhere the name al-Husayn Ibn \u2018Al\u012b is used here, then it is referring to this crusader agent and not to the noble son of \u2018Al\u012b Ibn Ab\u012b T\u0101lib (radiyall\u0101hu \u2018anh).\n\u201cShar\u012bf\u201d al-Husayn - The first in a line of Arab taw\u0101gh\u012bt used and discarded by the crusaders\ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "CONSPIRACY THEORY SHIRK", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "14"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq9-FOREWORD", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "9", "schema:articleBody": "Many  of  those  who  attained  shah\u0101dah  fighting the  crusaders  in  their  own  lands  had  first  taken steps to make hijrah to the lands of jih\u0101d.

We announce that this sectarian mission aims at dividing the Ummah, weakening its forces, taking its riches, and occupying the Muslims\u2019 sanctuaries in  Makkah  al-Mukarramah  and  al-Mad\u012bnah  alMunawwarah. This is a matter that we will never allow to happen, whatever the circumstances may be. Thus we have prepared two thousand fighters from the heroes of Faylaq ash-Sh\u0101m to be under the command of the Servant of the Noble Haramayn, King  Salm\u0101n  Ibn  \u2018Abdil-Az\u012bz  \u0100l  Sa\u2019\u016bd,  so  that they defend the lands of the Noble Haramayn and defeat the enemies of the Ummah from amongst the tails and arms of Iran in the brotherly land of Yemen. We do this to support the truth and out of loyalty to the one who stood by and supported the struggle of the Syrian people. And we indeed stand up  in  defense  of  the  Muslims\u2019  holy  sanctuaries through our humble contribution of two thousand fighters  from  the  best  of  the  sons  of  Sh\u0101m.  We appeal to the countries from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to rush to stand in the face  of  this  Safaw\u012b  plan  and  to  strive  to  stop  all those who allowed themselves to transgress against our sanctities and holy sanctuaries. Indeed Iran\u2019s insolence and that of its tails will not be deterred except  with  resolve2,  and  it  will  not  be  stopped except by the language of resolve, and this is what we  are  now  doing  with  all  strength  and  resolve, asking Allah (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101) for victory and steadfastness.\u201d\n\u201c{And  Our  word  has  already  preceded  for  Our servants,  the  messengers,  [That]  indeed,  they would be those given victory And [that] indeed, Our  soldiers  will  be  those  who  overcome}  [AsS\u0101ff\u0101t: 171-173].\u201d\n\u201cAnd our last call is that all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the creation.\u201d\n\u201cFaylaq ash-Sh\u0101m\u201d\u201c25 Rajab 1436 / 14 May 2015\u201dThis ends their statement of deviance.\n2 Editor\u2019s Note: This and all subsequent usage of the word is in reference to the \u201cStorm of Resolve\u201d announced by \u0100l Sal\u016bl.\nIt  is  important  to  note  that  when  the  apostates (the Taw\u0101gh\u012bt and the R\u0101fidah) fight each other, it is not permissible for the Muslim to support one party  of  apostates  against  the  other  by  fighting under  the  leadership  of  one  party  or  fighting in  its  defense.  Allah  (ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101)  said,  {Those  who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve  fight  in  the  cause  of  t\u0101gh\u016bt.  So  fight against  the  allies  of  Shayt\u0101n}  [An-Nis\u0101\u2019:  76]. So  it  is  not  permissible  for  the  Muslim  to  fight against \u0100l Sal\u016bl under the leadership of the R\u0101fid\u012b Houthis nor is it permissible to fight against the R\u0101fid\u012b Houthis under the leadership of \u0100l Sal\u016bl. If he does fight under the leadership of the t\u0101gh\u016bt in defense of his kufr\u012b regime, he apostatizes from Islam.  Therefore,  the  Muslim  should  know  that the obligation upon him when the apostates wage war  against  each  other  is  to  declare  his  bar\u0101\u2019ah from  both  apostate  parties  and  \u2013  if  he  is  able  \u2013 to perform jih\u0101d against both of them for Allah\u2019s sake.\nAs  to  the  cause  behind  this  deviant  declaration being  released,  then  it  is  the  addiction  of  these factions  to  t\u0101gh\u016bt  aid.  Initially,  the  taw\u0101gh\u012bt trap  them  with  supposedly  \u201cinnocent\u201d  and \u201cunconditional\u201d  aid  before  they  slide  down  a slippery slope of concessions ending with blatant apostasy.\nAnd  so,  will  the  jih\u0101d  claimants  of  the  Jawl\u0101n\u012b front  wage  \u201cjih\u0101d\u201d  against  their  allies,  the shameless slaves of \u0100l Sal\u016bl? Or are there endless excuses  prepared  for  each  blatant  statement  of apostasy made by them? \u0100l Sal\u016bl have now openly occupied  parts  of  Idlib,  Halab,  and  Sh\u0101m  in general through this \u201clegion,\u201d Zahr\u0101n \u2018All\u016bsh, and their  brothers  from  the  \u201cIslamic\u201d  Front.  Worst yet, the factions of \u201cJaysh al-Fath\u201d are referred to as  \u201cAhlus-Sunnah\u201d  and  the  \u201ctruthful  muj\u0101hid\u012bn\u201d by al-Jawl\u0101n\u012b in his most recent speech!\nMay  Allah  expose  the  hypocritical  and  apostate allies of \u201cal-Q\u0101\u2019idah\u201d in Sh\u0101m3. \n3 It is hizbiyyah and irj\u0101\u2019 that allowed the Syrian \u201cal-Q\u0101\u2019idah\u201d to support these apostate factions against the muh\u0101jir\u012bn and ans\u0101r.

They are also divided about their duny\u0101 and they consider this good. So he \uf067 came with unity regarding the religion with Allah\u2019s statement, {He has ordained for you  of  religion  what  He  enjoined  upon  N\u016bh  and  that which We have revealed to you, and what We enjoined upon  Ibr\u0101h\u012bm  and  M\u016bs\u0101  and  \u2018\u012as\u0101  \u2013  to  establish  the religion  and  not  be  divided  therein}  [Ash-Sh\u016br\u0101:  13]. Allah \uf063 also said, {Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become sects \u2013 you have nothing to do with them}  [Al-An\u2019\u0101m:  159].  He  also  prohibited  us  from being like them with Allah\u2019s statement, {And do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them. And those will have a great punishment} [\u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 105]. He also prohibited us from dividing about the duny\u0101 with Allah\u2019s statement, {And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do  not  become  divided}  [\u0100l  \u2018Imr\u0101n:  103].  The  third of these matters is that they considered disobeying the person in authority and refusing to yield to him a virtue. They considered hearing and obeying him humiliation and  disgrace.  Allah\u2019s  Messenger  \uf067  opposed  them  and ordered his companions to be patient with the injustices of the rulers2. He ordered them to hear and obey them and give them sincere advice. He was severe about this, expressed it, and repeated it. These three matters he \uf067 gathered together in the had\u012bth reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and  Muslim,  \u2018Allah  is  pleased  with  three  matters  for you, that you worship Him and not associate anything with Him in worship, that you hold to the rope of Allah together  and  not  divide,  and  that  you  sincerely  advise those whom Allah gives authority over you.\u2019 No calamity occurred  in  the  people\u2019s  religion  and  duny\u0101  except  by violation  of  these  three  principles  or  some  of  them\u201d [Mas\u0101\u2019il al-J\u0101hiliyyah].\nHe  \uf072  also  said,  \u201cFrom  the  most  amazing  things  and greatest  signs  showing  the  power  of  Allah  \uf063  are  six principles  that  He  \uf063  made  very  clear  more  so  than what  the  doubtful  people  think.  Thereafter,  many  of the  \u2018intelligent\u2019  people  of  the  world  and  \u2018wise\u2019  men  of mankind erred about these principles, except for a very few.  \u2026  The  second  principle  [after  the  obligation  of tawh\u012bd  and  prohibition  of  shirk]  is  that  Allah  ordered with unity regarding the religion and prohibited division within it. Allah clarified this with clear and conclusive evidence that the laymen can understand. He prohibited us from being like those who divided before us and thus were  destroyed.  He  also  mentioned  that  He  ordered the  Messengers  with  unity  regarding  the  religion  and 2 He refers to Muslim rulers who rule by the Shar\u012b\u2019ah but commit injustices, not rulers who apostatize by legislating, executing, or judging by manmade laws, nor rulers who have wal\u0101\u2019 to the crusaders against the Muslims.\nprohibited  them  from  division  within  it.  What  makes this  clearer  is  what  the  Sunnah  came  with  of  amazing teachings in this regards. Then the matter changed until division  over  the  fundamentals  and  branches  of  the religion  became  \u2018knowledge\u2019  and  \u2018fiqh  of  the  religion\u2019! And  then  no  one  called  to  the  obligation  to  unite regarding the religion except for a \u2018zind\u012bq\u2019 or \u2018madman\u2019! The third principle is that the fulfillment of unity is by hearing and obeying he who has been granted authority over  us  even  if  he  might  be  an  Ethiopian  slave.  Allah clarified this prevalently and sufficiently through various kinds of shar\u2019\u012b and qadar\u012b evidences. It then became the fundamental  not  known  to  most  of  the  claimants  of knowledge. What then of acting in accordance with this matter!\u201d [Six Great Beneficial Fundamentals].\nAnd  although  jam\u0101\u2019ah  is  from  the  most  obvious  of obligations with even the fitrah of many animals being inclined to it, the modern claimants of Islam argue that it is better for the Ummah to have religious and political pluralism!  They  prefer  that  Ahlus-Sunnah  tolerate  the various  sects  of  bid\u2019ah  and  even  apostasy  who  claim to belong to the Muslim Ummah. They also wish that Ahlus-Sunnah  would  permit  the  existence  of  deviant, warring, and selfish political parties and militant factions on the liberated Muslim lands! They made taql\u012bd (blind following)  of  their  partisan,  evil  \u201cscholars\u201d  an  essential aspect of \u201creligion.\u201d And through this, they propagated the  \u201cvirtue\u201d  of  division  and  denounced  the  \u201cevil\u201d  of jam\u0101\u2019ah  in  their  campaign  against  the  revived  body  of Islam, the Khil\u0101fah. How wicked are the deviant parties and corrupt \u201cscholars\u201d!\nTherefore  know  \u2013  may  Allah  have  mercy  upon  you  \u2013 that  the  major  basis  for  the  religions  of  the  J\u0101hiliyyah was taql\u012bd. After Im\u0101m Muhammad Ibn \u2018Abdil-Wahh\u0101b \uf072  mentioned  the  first  three  aspects  of  their  religion (shirk, religious division, and political disunity), he said, \u201cThe fourth matter is that their religion is based upon principles, the greatest of which is taql\u012bd. It is the major principle for all the kuff\u0101r, the first of them and last of them, as Allah \uf063 said, {And similarly, We did not send before you any warner into a city except that its affluent said, \u201cIndeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are, in their footsteps, following\u201d} [Az-Zukhruf: 23]. He \uf063 also said, {And when it is said to them, \u201cFollow what Allah has revealed,\u201d they say, \u201cRather, we will follow that upon which we found our fathers.\u201d Even if Shayt\u0101n was inviting them to the punishment of Hellfire?} [Luqm\u0101n: 21]. So he \uf067 came to them with Allah\u2019s statement, {Say, \u201cI only advise you of one thing \u2013 that you stand for Allah, [seeking truth] in pairs and individually, and then give thought.\u201d There is not in your companion any madness. \ndabiq\n\fonly begin his killings by killing Quraysh. He will not accept from them anything but war and he will not offer them anything but the sword.\u201d An-Nu\u2019m\u0101n\u012b also reports that Ja\u2019far as-S\u0101diq said, \u201cWhen al-Q\u0101\u2019im from the family of the Prophet emerges, he will bring five hundred people from Quraysh and strike their necks. He will then bring five  hundred  more  and  strike  their  necks.  He  will  do so  six  times  [thereby  killing  three  thousand  men  from Quraysh].  He  will  kill  them  and  their  patrons.\u201d  He also  reports  that  Ja\u2019far  as-S\u0101diq2  said,  \u201cWhen  al-Q\u0101\u2019im emerges,  nothing  will  be  between  him  and  both  the Arabs and Quraysh except the sword.\u201d\nSo  the  R\u0101fid\u012b  \u201cMahd\u012b\u201d  speaks  in  Hebrew,  rules  by  the Torah,  is  followed  by  the  Jews,  and  kills  the  Arabs especially Quraysh! Is this a description of the Mahd\u012b or the  Dajj\u0101l?  Consider  that  seventy  thousand  Jews  from Asbah\u0101n  (Isfahan  of  modern-day  Iran)  will  follow  the Dajj\u0101l as in the had\u012bth reported by Muslim from Anas \uf068.\nAlso consider that the Dajj\u0101l will emerge from the region of the Khaw\u0101rij as in the had\u012bth reported by Ibn M\u0101jah from Ibn \u2018Umar \uf06b. And also consider that those who deny  Qadar  are  from  the  followers  of  the  Dajj\u0101l  as  in the had\u012bth reported by Ab\u016b D\u0101w\u016bd from Hudhayfah \uf068. This is important for two reasons, the R\u0101fidah are from the  biggest  Kh\u0101rij\u012b  sects.  They  and  the  other  Khaw\u0101rij have a common root in the Jew \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ibn Saba\u2019, who partook  in  the  mutiny  against  the  righteous  Khal\u012bfah \u2018Uthman  \uf068.  For  this  reason,  some  of  the  scholars have also referred to the Khaw\u0101rij as \u201cSaba\u2019iyyah.\u201d3  In 2 Note that Muhammad al-B\u0101qir, Ja\u2019far as-S\u0101diq, and al-Hasan al-\u2018Askar\u012b \uf073 were not R\u0101fidah. They were from the family of the Prophet \uf067 just as \u2018Al\u012b, F\u0101timah, al-Hasan, and al-Husayn \uf06a were from the family of the Prophet \uf067. And just as the R\u0101fidah fabricated lies in the name of \u2018Al\u012b and his immediate family \uf06a, they fabricated lies in the name of his noble descendants \uf073.3 The closeness of the R\u0101fidah to the other Khaw\u0101rij is visible in the wal\u0101\u2019 between Iran\uf067 \n70,000 Jews from Asbah\u0101n will follow the Dajj\u0101l\naddition,  the  R\u0101fidah  are  infamous  for  pronouncing takf\u012br  upon  the  majority  of  the  Ummah  including  the best of the Ummah \u2013 the Companions of the Prophet \uf067 \u2013 rejecting the authority of the khulaf\u0101\u2019, even cooperating with  the  Crusaders  and  the Tatars  against  the  khulaf\u0101\u2019 and their Muslim subjects. The R\u0101fidah have a history of  massacring  Muslims  who  refuse  R\u0101fid\u012b  beliefs.  This became most manifest during the Safaw\u012b empire (\u201c15011736CE\u201d) and its war against Ahlus-Sunnah in Persia. Finally, the R\u0101fidah are one of the sects of Qadariyyah, as they deny that good and evil deeds are by Allah\u2019s qadar.\nHence  the  apostate  R\u0101fidah  combined  between  major shirk (worship of the family of the Prophet \uf067), denial of  the  Qur\u2019\u0101n  and  the  Sunnah  (as  they  claim  the Companions \uf06a fabricated the religious texts), takf\u012br of the Companions \uf06a  and the Mothers of the Believers \uf06c, and belief in the deviant innovations of the Khaw\u0101rij and Qadariyyah. When reflecting upon this and the fact that the Jews await their so-called Messiah \u2013 as the Jews deny  the  messengership  of  Jesus  \uf06e,  who  will  return before the Hour \u2013 it is expected that the R\u0101fidah will ally blatantly with the Jews in the future in their war against Islam and the Muslims.4 \nWe  seek  refuge  with  Allah  for  Ahlus-Sunnah  from  the evil of the Dajj\u0101l.\n\uf067and Oman. Oman is ruled solely and populated mostly by the Ib\u0101diyyah. The Ib\u0101diyyah are historically a deviant Kh\u0101rij\u012b sect; but over the last centuries they have mutated into an apostate Jahm\u012b sect. Their t\u0101gh\u016bt \u201csultan\u201d legislates manmade laws and has wal\u0101\u2019 to the Crusaders, the Arab and non-Arab taw\u0101gh\u012bt including \u0100l Sal\u016bl, and the R\u0101fidah.4 Although it is not possible to know with certainty how exactly such will come about, it is interesting to note that 340 Jewish American rabbis recently wrote a letter addressed to the American congress in support of American-Iranian reconciliation, as reported by \u201cI24News\u201d (a Jewish news channel) on \u201c18 August 2015\u201d in an article titled \u201cHundreds of US Rabbis Voice Support for Iran Nuclear Deal.\u201d The report adds that the Jewish Defense Forces Military Intelligence Directorate\u2019s Research Department presented its stance to the political leadership of the Jewish state and \u201cemphasized the possible benefits that could come of the deal.\u201d\ndabiq\n\f", "schema:headline": "THE EVIL OF DIVISION AND TAQL\u012aD", "schema:author": "http://dbpedia.org/page/Dabiq_(magazine)", "schema:pageStart": "10"}, {"@id": "http://dashboard-trivalent.cluster.gsi.dit.upm.es/resources/Dabiq11-FROM-THE-PAGES-OF-HISTORY", "@type": "schema:Article", "magazine": "Dabiq", "number": "11", "schema:articleBody": "deeds  would  certainly  be  accepted,  and  thereafter  they would certainly have a pious ending!

All  three  fought  alongside \u2018Abdull\u0101h \u2018Azz\u0101m  and were formerly praised by him in  his  speeches  and  letters.  After  the  collapse  of  the communist  Afghan  regime,  they  together  along with  others  established  the  so-called  \u201cIslamic  State of  Afghanistan\u201d  in  \u201c1992.\u201d  This  \u201cstate\u201d  would  later organize  the  \u201cUnited  Islamic  Front  for  the  Salvation of Afghanistan\u201d AKA the \u201cAfghan Northern Alliance,\u201d which fought on behalf of the crusaders and taw\u0101gh\u012bt, this  becoming  most  manifest  after  the  blessed operations of September 11th.\n1  Note:  Some  of  the  individuals  and  factions  that  will  be  mentioned  never  fought  for Allah\u2019s cause to begin with \u2013 similar to the condition of many of the factions in Sh\u0101m \u2013 and yet some of the ignorant consider them \u201cmuj\u0101hid\u012bn\u201d just because they fought against crusaders, communists, and other kuff\u0101r for nationalist reasons.\nTajikistan\nAbdullo Nuri (former head of the \u201cIslamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan\u201d) fought against the communists of Tajikstan.
